Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiff was at the material time the owner of a car, BMW 3201A, bearing registration No EH 8118R. The defendants were the owners and operators of a night club known as Grand Palace De-luxe Nite Club at the Orchard Building. In connection with the operation of the night club, the defendants provided to their customers a car parking service at the front porch of the building. Attendants, known generally as car jockeys, were engaged and they stationed themselves at or near the front porch and offered to park cars of customers and others visiting the night club. There were two public car parks, one in front of the Orchard Building and one at the side, and cars were normally parked in these car parks.
On 4 April 1985, at about 11pm, the plaintiff went to the night club in his car and upon arrival at or near the front porch of the Orchard Building, he handed his car together with the key to a car jockey who attended on him and in exchange he was handed a ticket bearing No 16757. The jockey took over the car and drove it to a public car park; the plaintiff entered the night club. The plaintiff left the night club at about 1am on the following morning and requested a jockey to bring his car. The jockey, however, could not find the car or the key as both were missing.
On 28 August 1985 the plaintiff instituted this action against the defendants claiming damages for breach of contract or, in the alternative, for negligence. By his statement of claim (as subsequently amended) the plaintiff averred that he had handed and delivered his car to the defendants, their servants or agents on the implied condition that the defendants, their servants or agents would keep it safely and redeliver it to the plaintiff on demand, and in breach of this implied condition they had failed to keep the car safely and redeliver it to the plaintiff on demand. In the alternative, the plaintiff averred that the defendants, their servants or agents were negligent and by reason of their negligence (particulars of which were set out) the plaintiff suffered damage. In further alternative, the plaintiff averred that the defendants wrongfully failed, neglected or refused to redeliver the car to the plaintiff and thereby wrongfully detained the car whereby the plaintiff had suffered loss and damage.
In their defence (as subsequently amended) the defendants averred that at all material times the car parking service rendered to their customers was provided by an independent contractor, Lim Soo Kuang, and the defendants were not liable or responsible for any error or omission of the independent contractor and/or his servant or agent. In the alternative, the defendants averred that there was no contract between the plaintiff and the defendants, and that the car parking service was provided as a convenience and purely on a gratuitous basis and the plaintiff did not pay any sum for the service. In the further alternative, the defendants relied on a condition which they said was printed on the reverse side of the parking ticket handed to the plaintiff and also on a condition printed on a red notice board placed at or near the front porch of the building (the details of which I shall set out in a moment), both of which seek to exclude any liability of the defendants for loss or damage to cars of their customers. In the final alternative, the defendants pleaded that the car was parked at the public car park and the defendants, their servants or agents were acting as agents for the plaintiff for the purpose of parking the plaintiff`s car at the car park and were therefore not liable for any errors or omissions of such agents.
On the basis of the pleadings, the following issues have been raised:
 
 
(i) whether the jockey who parked the car for the plaintiff was at the material time a servant or agent of the defendants; 
 
(ii) whether there was, at the material time, a relationship between the plaintiff as the bailor and the defendants as the bailee in respect of the car; 
 
(iii) if there was such a relationship, whether the defendants were negligent or in breach of duty as the bailees; 
 
(iv) whether the defendants were relieved from liability by reason of the condition on the notice board and/or the condition on the reverse side of the parking ticket issued to the plaintiff, and 
 
(v) finally, if the defendants are liable, the measure of damages.
  
 
 
There was one further issue raised by the defence, namely, whether the jockey who parked the car for the plaintiff at the public car park did so as the servant or agent for the plaintiff. However, no argument was advanced by counsel for the defendants on this issue, and accordingly I do not propose to consider it.
I now turn to the evidence. The plaintiff`s evidence was that on the night of 4 April 1985, at about 11pm, he drove his car to the defendants` night club at the Orchard Building and on arrival at or near the front car porch of the building he found that there were car jockeys around. He said that he knew that they were jockeys of the night club, as they wore bush jackets with the name `Grand Palace` printed on the front pocket. He got out of the car, took the key from the dash board and handed it to a car jockey in attendance, and in return he received a ticket. The jockey took away his car and he went into the night club. He further said that he had been there several times and there were always jockeys around at or near the front porch who parked his car for him. At or near the porch there was a table where the jockeys would gather and there was also a key cabinet fixed to the wall on top of the table. In respect of the ticket issued to him on that occasion he said that he did not see any printed words on the reverse side, which was blank. He went up to the night club and had drinks with some friends. He left at about 1am on the following morning. When he came down, he gave the ticket to a jockey and waited for his car. He was later told that the car could not be found and the jockey was looking for the key also. Thereafter, he went round the whole car park looking for his car but could not find it. Nor could the key to his car be found. The manager and two others from the night club came down and made enquiries with the jockeys and also tried to look for the car; they could not find it either. Both the car and the key were lost. In the boot of his car were various items including his attache case, his pen, his watch and three squash racquets. He was referred to the photographs showing the positions of the table, key cabinet and the entrance. He said that the table and the key cabinet were about 15m from the entrance. He said he never saw the red notice board which the defendants claimed was placed at a position above the table and the key cabinet.
Apart from the question of the value of his car, the plaintiff adduced no other evidence. There was, however, no dispute on the plaintiff`s evidence that on the evening of 4 April 1985 he went to the night club in his car and handed it to a car jockey who attended on him and that both the car and key were missing. The dispute was centred on his evidence that the car jockeys wore uniforms with the name `Grand Palace` printed on the front pocket, that the reverse side of the ticket handed to the plaintiff was blank and that he did not see the red notice board placed on top of the key cabinet at or near the entrance.
The defendants called several witnesses. The first was one Ms Kwan Oon Kim who at the material time was working as the vice-chairman and director in the defendants` night club and her responsibilities were mostly administrative including the collection of daily cash. She testified that the defendants provided a car parking service to their customers and engaged one Lim Soo Kuang (`Lim`) to provide three to four jockeys every night for that purpose, for which he was paid $1,000 a month. The defendants had no control over the jockeys provided by Lim. The car parking service was purely for the convenience of the customers of the night club. She was referred to the photographs taken of the entrance to the night club and she testified that the table was about 5-6ft away from the entrance. She said that the red notice board appearing on the photograph was there at all material times.
Lim was called as a witness. He testified that he provided jockeys to night clubs and the defendants` night club was one of them. His arrangement with the defendants was that he provided three to four jockeys every night and the defendants paid him $1,000 per month and he in turn paid the jockeys. He gave instructions to the jockeys as to how to service the customers. Initially, he was at the defendants` night club every night, but later he was there only once or twice a week. After he instructed the jockeys on what to do he did not go there frequently.
The chairman of the board of directors of the defendants at the material time was one Tan Hwee Peow (`Tan`), and he also gave evidence. He was with the defendants until 1989. He was aware that a car parking service was provided to customers of the night club and that Lim provided the jockeys. The arrangement with Lim was made by the manager of the defendants, Allan Foo. He confirmed that the defendants paid Lim $1,000 per month and that Lim was to provide three to four jockeys every night. He said that the defendants provided Lim with tickets - he called them coupons - which they used in parking cars for the customers. He produced a specimen of the ticket that was used, on the face of which was printed a condition that the defendants were not liable for any loss of the car. With regard to the red notice board he said it was placed near the entrance of the building every night. The notice board would be taken down after work and kept in the defendants` office. The counterfoil portion of the ticket has a hole and that was used to attach it to the car key and the key was then hung up in the key cabinet. He produced a specimen of the ticket which the defendants gave to Lim and said that the defendants printed 50,000 tickets for use. All the tickets have words on both sides as shown on D2.
Finally, the defendants called Johari bin Mohamad Yatim (`Johari`), who was one of the jockeys in attendance on the night of 4 April 1985. He confirmed that he was employed by Lim and that he worked part time as a jockey. In 1985 he worked at the defendants` night club with three other jockeys. He said that when he parked the cars for the customers, he was not paid any money and he would park the cars at the public car park in front of Orchard Building. He further said that at that time there was a red notice board placed near the entrance. Every night when he and his colleagues started work they would bring down the table, the key cabinet and the red notice board from the defendants` office. The red notice board would be placed on top of the key cabinet. He confirmed that his service was to offer to park cars for customers who drove up to the front porch and who required jockeys to park their cars. He would use the tickets thus: one part of the ticket would be given to the customer and the other part, the counterfoil with a hole, would be retained until the customers came to collect their cars. He would write down the car number on the counterfoil and attach the key to it which was then put in the key cabinet.
Before I turn to the main issues raised before me, there are several disputed questions of fact in respect of which I ought to make my findings. The first is whether the jockeys employed to provide the car parking service to customers of the defendants` night club were employed by the defendants or Lim. On this, there was the evidence of Lim that the defendants engaged him to provide three or four jockeys every night to attend to their customers and park their cars. His evidence was corroborated by that of Ms Kwan, Tan and Johari, and the latter was one of the car jockeys who attended on customers of the night club on the evening of 4 April 1985. I accept their evidence on this point and I find that the car jockeys at all material times were in fact employed by Lim and not by the defendants.
The second question is whether the car jockeys at all material times wore any uniform provided by the defendants. The evidence of the plaintiff was that he had been to the night club many times, that there were jockeys around at or near the front porch and they each wore a bush jacket with the name `Grand Palace` printed on the front pocket. This was not admitted by Ms Kwan and Tan. But Lim did say that the defendants provided each of the jockeys with a white shirt but that the words `Grand Palace` were not printed on the front pocket. I am inclined to accept his evidence that the defendants did provide the car jockeys each with a white shirt. It seems to me that if the defendants had taken the trouble to provide these jockeys with white shirts it is more likely than not that they would have the words `Grand Palace` printed on the front pockets of the shirts as maintained by the plaintiff. I would accept the evidence of the plaintiff on this point, and on the balance of probabilities I find that the defendants at all material times provided each of the jockeys with a white shirt with their name `Grand Palace` printed on the front pocket.
The third disputed question of fact is whether at all material times the defendants displayed on the top of the key cabinet, which was near the entrance to the building, the red notice board bearing the following condition: 
 
Your vehicle is parked at your own risk. The management of Grand Palace Deluxe Niteclub shall not be responsible for any theft loss of/damage to the vehicle or its contents occasioned by the misfeasance, acts or omission or negligence of its employee and/or agent and/or the misfeasance, acts or omission or negligence of third parties.
 
 
 
and also whether the portion of the ticket issued to the plaintiff by the jockey in exchange for his car bore the following condition: 
 
Please be informed that the car parking services are provided for the convenience of our guest. All damages, accidents or losses are at guests` own risks.
 
 
 
There was certainly credible evidence given by Lim, Tan and Johari that at the material time there was a red notice board above the key cabinet near the entrance to the building and the notice board bore that condition. Tan`s evidence was that at that time the defendants had the notice board and the jockeys were instructed to display the notice board every evening. Lim said that he was given this notice board by the defendants and he instructed the jockeys to put up the notice board every evening. Johari confirmed that there was this red notice board and said that every evening when he and his colleagues turned up for work they would take the table, the key cabinet and the notice board from the defendants` office, and the notice board would be placed in a designated place above the key cabinet. On a balance of probabilities I find that at all material times the defendants had displayed the red notice board at the position above the key cabinet.
As regards the condition appearing on that portion of the ticket issued to the plaintiff, the evidence adduced was far from satisfactory. The plaintiff`s evidence was that that portion of the ticket did not have any such condition printed on it. He produced only a photocopy thereof and said he had lost the original. The copy has only the obverse side, and the reverse side was not reproduced. The defendants produced photocopies of both sides of an entire ticket which consisted of both portions used at the time: one with a hole which was to be retained by the jockey and to be attached to the key for hanging onto the key cabinet and the other to be given to a customer. These two portions appear on PB2. It appears from the impression of the holes on these copies that only the portion retained by the jockey had the condition printed thereon, and no such condition was printed on that portion given to the customer. This I must say is extremely odd; nonetheless, this is the conclusion I have come to from a close perusal of PB2. My only inference is that there was an error on the part of the jockeys and they had issued to the customers the portions of the tickets which they should have retained. The defendants then produced a specimen of a ticket, D2, which they claimed was used at the material time. D2 has two portions which are identical and are detachable, and each portion of D2 on the reverse side bore the condition. However, D2 is different from PB2, and I am not satisfied from the evidence that D2 was a specimen of the tickets used by the jockeys at the material time. The burden is on the defendants to prove that the ticket issued to the plaintiff contained this condition and they have not discharged this burden. I accordingly find that the portion of the ticket issued to the plaintiff did not bear the condition as alleged by the defendants.
 The first issue: Whether the jockey who parked the car for the plaintiff was at the material time a servant or agent of the defendants
In connection with the first issue I have already found that the jockeys were not employed by the defendants, but by Lim, an independent contractor. This finding supports the submission made by counsel for the defendants that as Lim was an independent contractor engaged by the defendants to provide jockeys for the car parking service, the defendants cannot be held responsible for any act or omission of the jockeys and are therefore not liable to the plaintiff for the loss of the car, even if the loss was caused by the negligence of the jockeys. In support of his argument, counsel relied on the following passage of the judgment of Slesser LJ in 
 Honeywill & Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers (London`s Commercial Photographers) Ltd 
, at p 196: 
 
It is well established as a general rule of English law that an employer is not liable for the acts of his independent contractor in the same way as he is for the acts of his servants or agents, even though these acts are done in carrying out the work for his benefit under the contract.
 
 
 
In that case, the plaintiffs who were specialists in acoustic work were anxious to have photographs taken of the interior of a cinema where they had done some work, and they engaged the defendants to take the photographs. In the process of taking the photographs, the defendants through their negligence caused a fire which damaged the stage curtain in the theatre. The plaintiffs paid the amount claimed by the cinema company as the cost of repair and sought to recover that amount from the defendants. It was contended by the defendants that the plaintiffs were not liable to the cinema company as the defendants were independent contractors. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs were liable to the cinema company as the work involved was of a dangerous character which imposed on the plaintiffs an obligation to take special precautions and ensure that the work was properly carried out so as not to cause any damage and that they could not delegate this obligation by having the work performed by an independent contractor.
The circumstances here are in no way near or similar to those in 
 Honeywill & Stein 
, and to that extent that case is of no application here. The broad statement of law relied upon by counsel for the defendants does not really go so far as to say that a person is not responsible, in all circumstances, for the acts of his independent contractor or those of the latter`s servant or agent. 
 Honeywill & Stein 
, is itself an illustration. The issue here is whether in the circumstances of the case, the jockeys though in the general employment of Lim, were at the material time pro hac vice in the employment of the defendants. For, it is a well-recognized principle that a servant in the general employment of A may, for a particular purpose, be treated as being pro hac vice in the employment of B (per Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle in 
 Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Hall Russell & Co Ltd 
, at p 689).
This question arose in the leading case of 
 Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins & Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd 
. There, the harbour board let a mobile crane to the stevedores for the purpose of loading a ship and provided a skilled workman, Newall, to operate the crane. In the course of operating the crane, through his negligence he injured a third party, McFarlane. McFarlane sued the stevedores and, in the alternative, the harbour board. From the evidence it appeared that the harbour board had engaged Newall, paid his wages, prescribed the jobs he should undertake and alone had the power to dismiss him. The stevedores had the immediate direction and control of the operations to be executed by him with the crane, eg to pick up and move a piece of cargo from the shed to ship, but had no power to direct how he should work the crane, the manipulation of the controls being a matter for him. The trial judge held that Newall was negligent and the harbour board liable on the ground that Newall was employed by them. The harbour board appealed to the Court of Appeal contending that at the material time Newall was in the employment of the stevedores. The appeal was dismissed. The harbour board further appealed to the House of Lords seeking to have the judgment against them substituted by a judgment against the stevedores on the ground that Newall, at the time of the accident and for the purpose of the operations in which he was then engaged, was the employee or servant of the stevedores. The appeal was dismissed. The House of Lords held that Newall was employed by the harbour board to operate the crane which belonged to them; that they alone had the right or power to control how he was to operate the crane; that they vested in Newall the discretion as to how to operate the crane and were therefore responsible for his negligent operation of the crane which occasioned the damage; that the test for determining whether Newall, at the time the tort was committed, continued to be in the general employment of the harbour board or was in the temporary employment of the stevedores was who had the right or authority to exercise control over how he was to operate the crane, and that the harbour board had not discharged the burden of showing that this right of control was at the material time vested in the stevedores. Viscount Simon said, at pp 9-10: 
 
... What has now to be decided is whether, in applying the doctrine of respondeat superior, liability attaches on these facts to the appellant board as the regular employers of Newall or to the respondent company as the persons who were temporarily making use of the crane which Newall was driving. The appellant board had engaged Newall, and it paid his wages: it alone had power to dismiss him. On the other hand, the respondent company had the immediate direction and control of the operations to be executed by the crane driver with his crane, eg to pick up and move a piece of cargo from shed to ship. The respondent company, however, had no power to direct how the crane driver should work the crane. The manipulation of the controls was a matter for the driver himself. In the present case the accident happened because of the negligent way in which the crane driver worked his crane, and since the respondent company had no control over how he worked it, as distinguished from telling him what he was to do with the crane, it seems to me to follow that Newall`s general employers must be liable for this negligence and not the hirers of the apparatus.
 
 
 
On the proper test to be applied in determining who was the employer of Newall, he said, at p 12: 
 
... I would prefer to make the test turn on where the authority lies to direct, or to delegate to, the workman, the manner in which the vehicle is driven. It is this authority which determines who is the workman`s `superior`.
 
 
 
On this test, Lord Macmillan said, at p 13: 
 
... The stevedores were entitled to tell him where to go, what parcels to lift and where to take them, that is to say, they could direct him as to what they wanted him to do; but they had no authority to tell him how he was to handle the crane in doing his work. In driving the crane, which was the appellant board`s property confided to his charge, he was acting as the servant of the appellant board, not as the servant of the stevedores. It was not in consequence of any order of the stevedores that he negligently ran down the plaintiff; it was in consequence of his negligence in driving the crane, that is to say, in performing the work which he was employed by the appellant board to do.
 
 
 
Similar pronouncement was made by Lord Simonds, at p 18: 
 
... it appears to me that the test can only be satisfied if the temporary employer (if to use the word `employer` is not to beg the question) can direct not only what the workman is to do but also how he is to do it. In the case before your Lordships the negligence of the workman lay not in the performance of any act which the respondents could and did direct and for which, because they procured it, they would be responsible, but in the manner in which that act was performed, a matter in which they could give no direction and for which they can have no responsibility.
 
 
 
In holding the harbour board, the general employer, liable for the tort committed by Newall, the House of Lords also said that if the board could show pro hac vice the workman had become the servant of the stevedores, they would escape liability. Lord Macmillan said, at p 13: 
 
... But it is always open to an employer to show, if he can, that he has for a particular purpose or on a particular occasion temporarily transferred the services of one of his general servants to another party so as to constitute him pro hac vice the servant of that other party with consequent liability for his negligent acts. The burden is on the general employer to establish that such a transference has been effected. ...
 
 
 
Lord Simonds said, at p 18: 
 
... He was engaged and paid and liable to be dismissed by them. So also, when the contract had been performed, he was their servant. If then in the performance of that contract he committed a tortious act, injuring McFarlane by his negligence, they can only escape from liability, if they can show that pro hac vice the relation of master and servant had been temporarily constituted between the respondents and Newall and temporarily abrogated between themselves and him.
 
 
 
The facts in the present case are clearly distinguishable from those in 
 Mersey Docks 
. This is not a case where Lim hired out an equipment together with skilled workers to the defendants. What Lim provided to the defendants was only labour in the form of three to four jockeys every night to attend to the service of parking cars for the customers of the defendants. There is a clear distinction between (i) a case such as 
 Mersey Docks 
, where an equipment is hired out together with a skilled operator and (ii) a case as here where only labour is provided. In the first case, the equipment is that of the general employer and obviously he has the right to tell the workman how to operate the equipment. As Lord Porter in 
 Mersey Docks 
, said, at p 17: 
 
... Where a man driving a mechanical device, such as a crane, is sent to perform a task, it is easier to infer that the general employer continues to control the method of performance since it is his crane and the driver remains responsible to him for its safe keeping.
 
 
 
In the second case, what is `hired out` is merely labour - relatively unskilled labour - and it is easy to infer that the `hirer` has the control or the right of control over what work is to be done as well as 
 how 
 the work is to be done.
Support for this analysis is found in Parker J`s decision in 
 Garrard v Southey & Co 
. There, the plaintiff was an employee of the first defendants, who were contractors in the business of electrical installation. The second defendants took over a factory and workshop which needed rewriting for electric light and power. Under an agreement between the two defendants, the plaintiff and his mates began work at the premises of the second defendants. They remained in the employment of the first defendants, although they worked exclusively at the second defendants` premises and conformed to their hours. The second defendants further supplied them with all the materials, tools, plant and equipment they required save a few of their own tools. The plaintiff was subsequently injured when he fell while climbing a structure within the premises of the second defendants which had completely rotted away. The question was who, at the time of the accident, was the master of the plaintiff and thus owed him the duty to provide proper plant and equipment. In determining this question, Parker J raised the case of 
 Mersey Docks 
, and made a distinction between that case and the one before him, and said, at p 600: 
 
... it seems to me that a distinction is to be drawn between cases such as the 
 Mersey Docks and Harbour Board
 case [1946] 2 All ER 345; 
[1947] AC 1
 where a complicated piece of machinery and a driver are lent, and cases where labour only, and labour not necessarily of a highly skilled character, is lent. In the former case it is easy to infer that the general employer does not intend to permit the hirer to have control over his valuable bit of machinery in the sense of being able to tell the workman how to work it. On the other hand, when it is a matter of not very highly skilled labour, it seems to me much more easy to infer that the hirer should have control not merely in the sense of being able to tell the workman what he wants doing, but also of deciding the manner of doing it.
 
 
 
In the circumstances, Parker J found that, at the time of the accident, a relationship of master and servant had arisen between the second defendants, as the temporary employers, and the plaintiff and consequently the second defendants owed the plaintiff the common law duty to provide proper plant and equipment.
The distinction made in 
 Garrard v Southey 
, was referred to by Denning LJ in 
 Denham v Midland Employers` Mutual Assurance 
. In that case, a company, Eastwoods engaged the contractors, Le Grand, to make test borings on their property and agreed to provide an unskilled worker to assist Le Grand in the performance of their contract. The unskilled worker so provided by Eastwoods was Clegg. In the course of assisting Le Grand`s employees in the performance of their contract, Clegg was killed through the negligence of Le Grand. It was accepted that Le Grand were liable. The question that arose was whether Le Grand were entitled to be indemnified by the insurer under their public liability policy or the insurer (which was a different insurer) under the employers` liability policy. It was held that Clegg was not under a contract of service with Le Grand and accordingly, they were entitled to an indemnity under the public liability policy. In the course of his judgment, Denning LJ made the following observation, at p 564: 
 
... a transfer [of service] rarely takes place when a man is lent with a machine, such as a crane or a lorry: or when a skilled man is lent so as to exercise his skill for the temporary employer. In such case the parties do not contemplate that the temporary employer shall tell the man how to manipulate his machine or to exercise his skill. A transfer does sometimes take place in the case when an unskilled man is lent to help with labouring work: see 
 Garrard v AE Southey & Co & Standard Telephones & Cables Ltd
 [1952] 1 All ER 597; 
[1952] 2 QB 174
. The temporary employer can then no doubt tell the labourer how he is to do the job. The labourer becomes so much part of the organization to which he is seconded that the temporary employer is responsible for him and to him.
 
 
 
Applying these principles to the facts found by the arbitrator, I have myself no doubt that, if a third person had been injured by the negligence of Mr Clegg in the course of his work, then Le Grand would be liable to the third person and not Eastwoods. So also, when Mr Clegg himself was killed, Le Grand are liable to his widow on the same footing as if they were his masters and not merely as invitors. These results are achieved in law by holding that Mr Clegg became for the time being the temporary servant of Le Grand.
It is true that these two cases concern the question of an employer`s duty to his servant and not the question of the vicarious liability of an employer for the acts of his servant. However, there can be no distinction in principle. In 
 Garrard v Southey 
, the question to be decided was who at the material time of the accident was the master of the plaintiff and hence the person who owed him the duty to provide proper plant and equipment. In this case, the question to be decided is who at the material time was the master of the jockeys and the person who would be responsible vicariously for the act of the jockeys. In both cases, liability is established on the basis of finding that pro hac vice the master and servant relationship had arisen.
I now revert to the facts in this case. What Lim hired out to the defendants is neither a piece of machinery nor highly skilled workmen. He provided jockeys who offered to park cars for customers of the defendants` night club. All the equipment or paraphernalia necessary to the operation of the car parking service was provided by the defendants themselves: they provided the table, the key cabinet and the red notice board, and all these were placed near the entrance to the night club - the position where all these were placed appeared to constitute the operation centre for the car parking service. They also provided a system by which the cars parked by the jockeys could be identified, namely, the provision of printed tickets with counterfoils which the jockeys would attach to the car keys. Furthermore, the jockeys were provided with white shirts imprinted with the name of the defendants` night club, thus enabling them to be easily identified for the car parking service. They became (in the words of Denning LJ) so much part of the organization of the defendants that the latter were responsible for them and to them and also for their acts or omissions. While Lim has testified that he told the jockeys how to perform the service, I am unable to accept his evidence at face value; it appears to me to be too contrived for the purpose of the defence. I also do not accept his evidence that he went to the night club to see how the jockeys performed their service. He might have gone there initially when he first provided these jockeys, but I do think that he went there regularly or frequently. There was no evidence that he did. It seems to me that the obligation of Lim was merely to hire a pool of jockeys for the defendants but these jockeys really worked for the defendants` night clubs, and the management of the night club gave them the necessary instructions, had overall control over them and had the right to dictate the manner and mode of their parking the cars of their customers. I am not persuaded that there was anything that prevented or could have prevented the defendants from telling the jockeys how they were to perform the service. In my opinion, the jockeys were pro hac vice the servants or agents of the defendants in providing a car parking service to the customers of the night club.
 The second issue: Whether there was, at the material time, a relationship between the plaintiff as the bailor and the defendants as the bailees in relation to the car
The system by which the car parking service was performed by the jockeys at the defendants` night club was this. Customers of the defendants` night club would drive up to the front porch of the Orchard Building. There, the jockeys waited in attendance and offered to park the cars. The customers, if they required the car parking service, would hand their cars and the keys (to their cars) to the jockeys who would then issue tickets to them whilst retaining the counterfoils. The customers were not concerned with where their cars would be parked. The jockeys would take the cars and park them in the public car park and attach the car keys to the counterfoil of the tickets, and place them in the key cabinet. To retrieve their cars, the customers would present their tickets to the jockeys, who would then locate the cars and drive them to the customers. In my opinion, on each occasion when a customer delivered the car or the key to the car to the jockey in attendance, he delivered possession of the car to the jockey and such delivery was made upon an implied trust that the jockey would park the car and subsequently retrieve the car for the customer upon the presentation of the ticket. The jockey pro hac vice was, as I have held, the servant or agent of the defendants. Hence, in the present case, on the night in question, when the plaintiff handed the key to his car to a jockey and in exchange received the ticket No 16757, the jockey took possession of the car as the servant or agent of the defendants, and thus there arose a relationship between the plaintiff as bailor and the defendants as the bailees of the car.
It was contended by counsel for the defendants that there was no delivery of possession of the car to the servants or agents of the defendants, as the mere handing over by a customer of his car to the jockey for the purpose of parking it in a public car park did not give rise to a delivery of possession. In support, counsel relied on 
 Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd 
, and 
 Maritime Coastal Containers Ltd v Shelburne Marine Ltd 
. In the first case, the House of Lords held, inter alia, that the stevedores who negligently dropped a drum containing chemicals while lowering it from an upper floor of a dock transit shed onto a lorry were not bailees of the drum. In the second case, Hallet J in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court held that the defendant shipyard who had, at the shipowner`s request, unloaded 40 tons of steel from the ship and placed them on some adjoining property, was not liable as a bailee for the loss of the steel since there had been no bailment arising from the unloading of the steel. However, in both these cases, there could not have been a delivery of possession of the goods in question as there was in the instant case. The stevedores in 
 Scruttons 
, and the shipyard in 
 Maritime 
, were merely performing the limited function they had contracted to do, which was to load and unload goods from a ship. In the performance of that function, there was no need for the delivery of the goods on trust or contract with the expectation that the goods would be redelivered. The situations that arose in these cases are therefore quite unlike the instant case where possession and control was taken of the plaintiff`s car by the jockey as a necessary corollary to the car parking service provided by the defendants. It is inconceivable that a customer such as the plaintiff would not expect that, in order for a jockey to carry out the function of parking the car for him, he would have to surrender in the interim possession and control of the vehicle to the jockey.
In the case of 
 Shorters Parking Station Ltd v Johnson 
, the plaintiff`s representative had been regularly parking his car at the defendant`s premises for reward. The consideration for parking the car there was Â£5 per month. Normally, the defendant housed the car in a covered car parking building but not in any fixed position. For this purpose, on arrival the driver was either directed to a position by an attendant or the car was simply left for the attendant to park the car later at a position of his own choice, but always the key was left in the ignition switch so that the defendant`s servants could move the vehicle when required. On the occasion that gave rise to the dispute, the plaintiff`s representative drove the car to the defendant`s basement and left it there with the key in the ignition switch. A thief stole the car from the spot where the attendant eventually parked the car. The plaintiff sued the defendant for negligence and it was held that in the particular circumstances the defendant was a bailee for reward and possession of the car had been delivered to them. They were therefore liable to make good the loss suffered by the plaintiff. The argument on appeal was that there had been no delivery of possession for any purpose other than the plaintiff`s own purposes and hence there was no evidence from which an intention of creating a bailment could be inferred. Hardie Boys J in the Supreme Court of Auckland on the basis of two decisions in Canada held that where there had been a delivery of a customer`s key (to the car) to the attendant in charge of the parking lot, there was a delivery of the car such as to make the proprietor of the parking lot a bailee and liable accordingly. There was actual delivery of possession by the plaintiff of his car to the defendant`s servant and his intention was that the defendant`s servant would keep it in safe custody.
The two Canadian decisions which were followed by Hardie Boys J were 
 Appleton et al v Ritchie Taxi 
, and 
 Way Sagless Springs Co Ltd v Bevradio Theatres Ltd 
. Both were decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal. In the first case, the plaintiff had left the car with the key in place in the charge of the attendant of the defendants` parking premises, and on payment of a small fee had been given a ticket. The car was subsequently taken from the lot by an unauthorized person and left abandoned. The plaintiff sued for the damage to the car and the loss of items he had in the car. Gillanders JA found that possession of the car had been delivered to and accepted by the defendants for safe custody and that a bailment relationship had arisen such that the defendants were liable for the damage. In 
 Way Sagless Springs 
, the defendants ran a theatre and invited their patrons to park their cars without charge at a parking lot operated in connection with their theatre. The plaintiff left his car with the defendants` servant and at his request, left the key in the car. The defendants` servant negligently left the key where a thief would expect to look for it, as a result of which the plaintiff`s car was stolen. Henderson JA found that the defendants were liable for the loss of the car.
In each of these cases, there was a delivery of possession of the car to the parking attendant concerned. This is directly applicable to the instant case where the plaintiff had left his car at the front porch and had given his key to a jockey in order for the latter to park his car. In my judgment, there was delivery of possession of the car to the jockey, the servant or agent of the defendants, and thus the relationship of the plaintiff as bailor and the defendants as bailees arose.
Before turning to the next main issue, there are two questions which need to be addressed. The first is whether it is material that the plaintiff`s car was parked in a public car park and not in a car park controlled or managed by the defendants. In my opinion, the duty of a bailee does not depend on whether the chattels, the subject of a bailment, are stored or kept in his own premises or elsewhere. The essence of bailment is the delivery of the chattels upon a trust on a contract under which the bailee undertakes to take reasonable care of the chattels and to redeliver them according to his agreement with the bailor. Possession of the chattels during the period of bailment lies with the bailee, irrespective of the premises in which the chattels are stored, and the bailee must fulfil his obligation to take reasonable care of the chattels. The fact that he stores the chattels in some place not within his control or management would necessarily entail that he has to take reasonable care to ensure that the chattels are properly secured against theft or damage.
The next question is whether the bailment is one for reward or gratuitous. It was submitted by counsel for the defendants that if there was a bailment it was a gratuitous bailment, as there was no fee charged by the defendants in provision of such parking service to their customers. I disagree. To constitute a bailment for reward it is not necessary that there should be an immediate or direct tangible benefit or advantage, such as payment of a fee to the bailee. In this case, the defendants owned and operated the night club and provided car parking service to their customers for which no charge or fee was levied; but that was part of the services they provided to their customers for coming to the night club. There is no doubt that they derived some benefit or advantage in the form of increased patronage to the night club. There would be no reason why the defendants would want to pay $1,000 a month for the provision of a gratuitous service to their customers unless they thought that it had some benefit to the night club. In my opinion, the bailment in this case is one for reward and it can in no way be said to be a gratuitous bailment. In the case of 
 Murphy v Hart 
, a restaurateur, in whose custody clothing or other articles were deposited temporarily as an incident to his general business was held liable as an ordinary bailee for reward for any loss resulting from negligence. Harris CJ said at p 38: 
 
The depositing of the overcoat in the place provided by the defendant for that purpose was for the benefit of both parties, and while no price was paid directly or specifically to the defendant for the care of the plaintiff`s overcoat, it was part of the accommodation for which the defendant received his recompense from his customers. It is obvious that the defendant derived some advantage in the way of increased trade by making his premises attractive and the providing of a place in which customers could leave their coats and hats while eating was a necessary incident to the business just as it is in the case of a barber shop, or a bathing house.
 
 
 
On principle I do not see why the defendant is not a bailee for hire quite as much as he would be if paid a specific sum for the care and custody of the plaintiff`s coat.
The instant case is similar to that in 
 Way Sagless Springs 
 where the theatre also provided a free parking service for its patrons.
It was pointed out by counsel for the defendants that 
 Murphy v Hart 
, was not followed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in 
 Martin v Town N` Country Delicatessen Ltd 
. That is true. But the facts in the latter case were different. There, the plaintiff with his wife and some friends went to the defendant`s restaurant for dinner. The defendant owned two parking lots, one immediately next to the restaurant and the second across the lane. The plaintiff was quite familiar with the parking lots as he had been a frequent customer at the defendant`s restaurant. On the night in question the plaintiff drove his vehicle to the parking lot nearest to the restaurant but as the lot was filled with cars and there was no parking space available for him, he drove his car into one of the aisles between the rows of cars. Ordinarily there was no attendant at these parking lots and the customers parked their cars themselves. However, sometimes on special occasions the defendant would retain one or more attendants for the purpose of maintaining a semblance of order in the parking lots. On the night in question a person, whom the plaintiff presumed to be an attendant, suggested to the plaintiff to leave his car at the aisle with the key in it agreeing to park the car for him when a parking lot became available. The plaintiff accordingly left the key in his car, and with his party went into the restaurant for dinner. At the end of the evening when the plaintiff went to collect his car, he found that it was missing and he was unable to locate the person with whom he had previously left the car. The car had been stolen. It was held that there was no bailment created by the plaintiff leaving his car at the defendant`s parking lot which was provided as a courtesy to its customers, and the relationship between the restaurateur and the customer was that of a licensor and licensee and no liability rested on the restaurateur for the loss or damage to the car. Miller CJM said at p 453: 
 
To make the defendant liable in the case before us, the plaintiff must establish bailment. I agree with the learned trial judge that this was not a case of bailment but, if it were, it would be a gratuitous bailment. Bailment is delivery of personal chattels in trust on a contract, express or implied, that the trust will be duly executed and the chattels redelivered as agreed. I cannot see any contract here, either express or implied, to accept the plaintiff`s car in trust. The facilities of the parking lot were made available gratuitously for the convenience of the plaintiff and others desirous of using the restaurant and arriving by car. The supply of a parking lot for the convenience of patrons was not a service covered by a consideration paid by patrons of the restaurant. Presumably the same prices would be charged people who walked to the restaurant, or who came by bus or taxicab, without any consideration for the furnishing of a parking lot for motorists. It would surely not be a bailment for reward and, even if it were a gratuitous bailment, the defendant was not guilty of gross negligence or fraud and therefore would not be liable for the plaintiff`s car. 
 Martin
 12 is of no assistance here. There was undoubtedly no bailment in that case; the car parks were provided for the use of the customers and the customers had to park their own cars. No tickets were issued and no attendants were provided to park the cars for any customers.
 
 
 
At any rate, in my opinion, it is not material in this case whether the bailment was one for reward or gratuitous, and this will be apparent when I deal with the issue of negligence or breach of duty as a bailee. In the case of a bailment for reward the duty of the bailee is to take reasonable care of the goods bailed, and in the case of a gratuitous bailment, the duty of the bailee is to take such care as a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his own goods. The difference between the two standards of care is very fine. In 
 Port Swettenham Authority v TW Wu & Co (M) Sdn Bhd 
, Lord Salmon, who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council, compared the effect of ss 104 and 105 of the Contracts (Malay States) Ordinance of 1950 with the position at common law in relation to bailments and said, at p 589: 
 
It is true that Malaysian law sets a single standard of care for all bailees - whether they are bailees for reward or gratuitous bailees - and it corresponds to the standard required of a gratuitous bailee at common law [
 viz to take as much care as a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his own goods
]. This standard, although high, may be a less exacting standard than that which the common law requires of a bailee for reward. But the line between the two standards is a very fine line, difficult to discern and impossible to define. After all, a man of ordinary prudence would presumably take reasonable care of his own goods. However this may be, there is no doubt that under Malaysian law interpreted in the light of the common law, ..., the onus is on the bailee to show that he has taken the care required by the law, of the goods entrusted to him.
 
 
 
Later, his Lordship having expressed his grave doubts on the correctness of the decision in 
 Giblin v McMullen 
, continued, at p 589: 
 
There is no compelling authority that a gratuitous bailee who fails to return the goods left in his custody is not obliged to explain why he is not able to return them and to show that their loss is not due to his failure to have taken as much care of the goods as a man of ordinary prudence would have taken of his own goods in similar circumstances. In any event, a bank, which offers its customers, in the ordinary course of business, the service of looking after goods deposited with it, can hardly be described as a gratuitous bailee. The bank must realize that were it to refuse a customer such a service it would probably lose the customer who would have no difficulty in finding another bank which would be happy to render the service which is normally offered by banks to their customers.
 
 
 
I find this passage of the judgment extremely apposite in meeting the argument made on behalf of the defendants that the bailment was gratuitous as no fee was charged for the car parking service.
 The third issue: If there was a bailor and bailee relationship, whether the defendants were negligent or in breach of duty as the bailee
I now turn to the issue of negligence or breach of duty on the part of the defendants. It was not disputed that the plaintiff had handed to a jockey the key to his car at or near the front porch of the Orchard Building at about 11pm on 4 April 1985 and was given the ticket in exchange. Thereafter, all that was known was that neither the key nor the car could be located at about 1am on the following morning when the plaintiff left the night club to collect his car. No evidence was adduced by the defendants to indicate any particular cause for the loss of the key or the car; nor was there any evidence that the jockeys had taken precaution to ensure that someone was always in attendance at the key cabinet to ensure that the keys would not be removed by an unauthorized person. There was absolutely no explanation as to how the key could have been missing. In these circumstances, the inference to be drawn is that the key and the car could not have been taken away by an unauthorized person without some lack of care on the part of the jockeys on duty at the time. This is a clear case of res ipsa loquitur. There was no plea of res ipsa loquitur by the plaintiff in the pleadings, but there is no need for a party to plead such an averment in the pleadings: see 
 Bennett v Chemical Construction (GB) Ltd 
. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that in the circumstances of that case the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied and there was no requirement to plead it. Davies LJ said, at p 1575: 
 
In my view it is not necessary for that doctrine to be pleaded. If the accident is proved to have happened in such a way that prima facie it could not have happened without negligence on the part of the defendants, then it is for the defendants to explain and show how the accident could have happened without negligence. The defendants made no attempt to do that in this case. In my judgment this is really a classic case of res ipsa loquitur.
 
 
 
In my judgment, the defendants were negligent or in breach of duty as the bailee, and this is still my conclusion even if the defendants were gratuitous bailees.
 The fourth issue: Whether the defendants were relieved from liability by reason of the condition on the notice board and/or the condition on the reverse side of the ticket issued to the plaintiff
I have held that the ticket issued by the jockey to the plaintiff in exchange for the key to his car did not contain any condition and hence no issue arises with reference to the ticket. However, I have found that the defendants, at all material times, had displayed the red notice board above the key cabinet near the entrance to the defendants` night club. The condition appearing on the red notice board (which I have earlier set out) has the effect of excluding any liability of the defendants for negligence or breach of duty. The question is whether the defendants had done all that was reasonable to bring this exclusion clause to the attention of the plaintiff so that it became a term of the bailment. Counsel for the defendants submitted that the defendants had indeed done so and relied on 
 Hood v Anchor Line (Henderson Brothers) Ltd 
, in support. In that case, the plaintiff was the passenger on a steamship and sustained personal injuries during the voyage and the steamship company relied on the exclusion clause contained in the ticket. The steamship company was found to have done all that was necessary to bring the exclusion clause in question to the attention of the passengers as they had given passengers their tickets enclosed in envelopes which carried a notice on the face thereof requesting passengers to read the conditions of the contract. In the envelope given to the plaintiff was the ticket with a printed notice on its face stating that it was issued subject to conditions set out there which contained, among other things, the exclusion clause. There was little else the defendants in that situation could have done to bring the exclusion clause to the attention of the passengers.
The case before me is entirely different. The condition on the red notice board was placed above the key cabinet some distance from the entrance. The evidence of the plaintiff was that it was 15m away and the evidence of Ms Kwan was that it was 5 or 6ft away. I think that the testimony of both the witnesses was too extreme. I think that looking at the photographs, the distance would probably be about 10 to 15ft from the entrance. Even if the notice board was about 5 or 6ft from the entrance, the defendants would still have to show that it was visible from the position where the plaintiff handed his key to the jockey. There was no evidence as to the state of lighting where the red notice board was placed. Further, a customer arriving at the night club for entertainment and drinks would not be expected to stop to read the notice board placed at the side of the entrance. It was further pointed out that the red notice board was placed at an unusual height, fairly far away from the usual flow of traffic, whether human or vehicular and was of rather small size. I find it highly unlikely that any customer of the defendants such as the plaintiff would have noticed or seen the notice board when they left the cars with the jockeys for parking. In these circumstances, the defendants have failed to show that the contents of the red notice board had been brought to the notice of the plaintiff at the material time and was a term of the bailment.
There are two cases cited by counsel for the plaintiffs which reinforce the conclusion I have reached. The first is 
 Mendelssohn v Normand Ltd 
, where the Court of Appeal found that a condition displayed on the reception desk of the defendant garage could not be seen by the driver when he brought his car to the garage but only when he came back to collect it or to pay the parking charge. That being the case, the notice was not incorporated into the contract `unless it was brought home to the party so prominently that he must have taken to have known of it and agreed to it`. Since the garage company did not prove that the plaintiff knew of the terms of the notice and agreed to it, they could not rely upon it to absolve themselves from liability for the loss of the valuables the plaintiff had left in his car which he had left in the garage.
The second case is 
 Kua Lee Ngoh v Jagindar Singh t/a Speedway Station 
. There, the defendants had two exemption notices placed in two prominent and visible portions respectively of the defendants` premises but the trial judge accepted the evidence of the plaintiff`s husband that he had not seen them and that the defendants` servants or agents had not brought them to his attention. It is significant that in that case the plaintiff`s husband had been sending the vehicle to the defendants` premises for servicing for over a year and yet it was held that the defendants had not established that the exemption notices were brought to the attention of the plaintiff`s husband.
On this issue, I would respectfully refer to and adopt the following passage of the judgment of Denning LJ in 
 Harling v Eddy 
, at p 748: 
 
The principle which underlies these cases is this: if a person wishes to exempt himself from a liability which the common law imposes on him, he can only do it by an express stipulation brought home to the party affected and assented to by him as part of the contract. The party who is liable at law cannot escape liability by simply putting up a printed notice, or issuing a printed catalogue, containing exempting conditions. He must go further and show affirmatively that it is a contractual document and accepted as such by the party affected: see 
 Olley v Marlborough Court Ld
 
[1949] 1 KB 532
.
 
 
 
 
 The fifth issue: The measure of damages
 
I now come to the assessment of damages. The first and most important item is the value of the car at the material time. The plaintiff claims $70,000 as the value of the car at the time. The car was a BMW 320 automatic and the plaintiff had it for less than one year before the incident. There was evidence that BMW cars were highly popular at the time and there were not many individual sellers in the market for BMW cars of less than one year old. The insured value of the car was $85,000. Zakaria Abdul Kadir, a licensed appraiser, expressed the opinion that the value of the plaintiff`s car was $70,000, and there was no contrary evidence that this value was wrong or excessive. It does not appear to me to be excessive. I therefore accept the sum of $70,000 as the true value of the car.
As for the various items of personal effects in the boot of the car, I disallow the plaintiff`s claim for $3,000 representing the total value of his attache case, a Dupont pen and an Omega watch, as he has not satisfied me why he should have left these items in the boot of his car when he went to the night club. I also disallow (i) the claim for $500 as the value for his drawings and office documents, and (ii) the claim of $200 representing the value of T-shirts, shorts, towels and squash bags. I am not satisfied that the costs of replacing the drawings and documents would be anywhere near the region of $500. As for the claim of $200, the amount seems to me to be much too exaggerated for those items. I allow a sum of $650 representing a reasonable sum for the value of squash racquets and sports shoes.
As regards the loss of the use of his car I would allow a reasonable period and in this case, I think a period of 15 days would be reasonable, and I allow a sum of $1,020 on the basis of the rates given by the plaintiff.
In the result, there will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $71,670, and in exercise of my discretion I award interest at 4% on that sum from 28 August 1985 to the date of judgment. I also order that the defendants pay the costs of these proceedings.
