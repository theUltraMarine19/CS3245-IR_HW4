      The plaintiff and her husband were leasehold tenants of a house belonging to the defendant. Over a period of six years they lodged three separate complaints with the defendant concerning the functioning of their domestic hot water service. They complained that the service was so sensitive to the opening of faucets elsewhere in the house that a user of the shower was exposed to widely fluctuating water temperatures which were unsafe and dangerous. The service was not repaired. After six years of tenancy the plaintiff fainted while showering, suffering spinal injuries from the resulting fall. The plaintiff argued that her unconsciousness and resulting injury were caused by a substantial and sudden increase in water temperature itself a result of the defendant’s negligent failure to maintain and repair the hot water service. The trial judge entered judgment in the plaintiff’s favour and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs. The defendant appealed in relation to liability and quantum of damages. 
       
      Held: 
       Allowing the appeal (Heydon JA, Hodgson JA agreeing, Powell JA dissenting), 
       
      (1) As to foreseeability, 
       
      (a) ‘proximity’ is not an essential element in liability for negligent acts; it is a concept with a limited role: at [59]. 
       
      (b) that reasonable foreseeability is an ‘undemanding’ standard is not certain under the current law: [60]. 
       
      (c) reasonable foreseeability is a necessary condition for liability in negligence, not a sufficient condition. 
       
      Minister Administering the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act, 1979 v San Sebastian Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 268; Sullivan v Moody (2001) 183 ALR 404 considered. 
       
      (2) As to the scope of the duty of care: 
       
      (a) it is open to the Court of Appeal to formulate the duty of care for itself. Here the defendant fell under a duty to repair or replace the hot water system: [67]. 
       
      (b) the scope of the duty formulated by the Court of Appeal agreed with that of the trial judge. 
       
      (3) It was open to the trial judge to base his conclusions where appropriate on common knowledge without the need for specific evidence: [70].  
       
      (4) The defendant fell below the response of a reasonable man to the risk created by the hot water system.  
       
      Observations on burden of proof: [77]-[80]. 
       
      (4) The question was not whether the defendant was liable for “psychological shock precipitating a faint” in the plaintiff, but the plaintiff’s physical injury: [87]-[91].

      Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] AC 837; Kavanagh v Akhtar (1998) 45 NSWLR 588 and Commonwealth v McLean (1996) 41 NSWLR 389 applied. 
       
      (5) As to damages: 
       
      (a) the trial judge’s assessments of general damages and of special damages for loss of future earnings were within the range of a sound judgment: [99], [103]-[107]. 
       
      (b) However, the trial judge’s assessment of damages for pure economic loss occasioned by the necessity of the plaintiff’s husband ceasing paid employment was excessive for the period after the trial hearing. The plaintiff was able complete more tasks than the trial judge had found, and estimates of time spent in execution of his wife’s former duties given by the plaintiff’s husband were too great. Damages for that period should be discounted by one third: [126]-[127].

      1. The appeal is allowed. 2. The verdict of the trial judge is set aside. 
      
      3. In lieu of the verdict of the trial judge, there will be a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $532,908 with judgment accordingly with effect from 13 September 2000. 
       
       
      4. The defendant is to pay half of the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal. 
       
      5. It is noted that the costs order made by the trial judge still stand.

       NEW SOUTH WALES LAND & HOUSING CORPORATION v WATKINS 
       
       
       Judgment 
       
     1 POWELL JA: I have read, in draft, the Judgment which has been prepared by Heydon JA, with which Judgment I understand Hodgson JA to agree. I regret, however, that I am unable to share their Honours’ views that, to the extent to which the Appellant sought to have the judgment of G.S. Hosking DCJ set aside and judgment entered in its favour, the appeal should be dismissed. On the contrary, I am of the opinion that, at trial, the Respondent failed to establish that the Appellant had not discharged the duty of care which it was conceded that the Appellant owed to her.  
     2 To accept, as the Appellant, at trial, did, that the Appellant owed to the Respondent, as a member of the household of the Appellant’s tenant, a duty to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risk of injury to her (Northern Sandblasting Pty. Limited v. Harris  (1) Jones v. Bartlett  (2)) does not take one very far, for it is still necessary to determine what, in all the circumstances of this case, was the content of the duty of care conceded, for, until that has been done, one cannot determine whether, in the light of the evidence, a breach of that duty had been established.  
     3 Determining the content of the duty of care involves one in a two step process, as the following well known passage in the Judgment of Mason J in Wyong Shire Council v. Shirt  (3) makes clear: 
      
       
        
        “In deciding whether there has been a breach of the duty of care the tribunal of fact must first ask itself whether a reasonable man in the defendant’s position would have foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of person including the plaintiff. If the answer be in the affirmative, it is then for the tribunal of fact to determine what a reasonable man would do by way of response to the risk. The perception of the reasonable man’s response calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have. It is only when these matters are balanced out that the tribunal of fact can confidently assert what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in the defendant’s position.  
        
       
       
        
        The considerations to which I have referred indicate that a risk of injury which is remote in the sense that it is extremely unlikely to occur may nevertheless constitute a foreseeable risk. A risk which is not far-fetched or fanciful is real and therefore foreseeable. But, as we have seen, the existence of a foreseeable risk of injury does not in itself dispose of the question of breach of duty. The magnitude of the risk and its degree of probability remain to be considered with other relevant factors.” 
        
       
     4 It is clear that Hosking DCJ did not carry out such an exercise as was indicated by Mason J (as he then was) in Wyong Shire Council v. Shirt  (4) , as the following passage from his Judgment (RAB 18) makes clear: 
      
       
        
        “In terms of … breach of duty, in my view there was a breach of the defendant’s duty of care because a system which contained water which was so hot and with taps and/or plumbing so sensitive that the turning on of a cold tap elsewhere in the house produced scalding water presented an obvious danger to occupants of the premises. I find as a fact that the defendant knew of this danger because the plaintiff’s husband had twice reported it to the Liverpool office.” 
        
       
       
      a passage which not only overstated what was said to have been the problem but also seems to indicate that his Honour was of the view that the existence of what was said to have been the problem, without more, indicated that there had been a breach by the Appellant of its duty of care. 
       
     5 Upon analysis, the position appears to have been, simply, that the water supplied by the hot water service was hot; that, unless mixed with cold water it was, or could be, painful to touch; and that,if, after the water had been adjusted to a comfortable temperature, a cold water tap was turned on in another part of the house, the temperature of the water which had previously been adjusted would tend to rise. However, as Hosking DCJ also recorded in his Judgment (RAB 13): 
      
       
        
        “(The plaintiff) said that while the hot water service concerned her because it was simply too hot and that at times she had to pull her hand away because the hot water was uncomfortable, that she had, never in fact, burned herself. I infer that no other member of her family was actually burned by the hot water either.” 
        
       
     6 Given that this was the nature of what was said to be the problem, the question then is what steps were reasonably required of the Appellant? 
     7 In the Amended Ordinary Statement of Claim which was filed on the Respondent’s behalf, the following particulars of negligence were given (RAB 3-4): 
      
       
        
        “(a) Failing to take any or any adequate precautions for the plaintiff’s safety; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Putting the plaintiff in a position of peril in the circumstances; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Failing to ensure that the shower within the premises was safe for use by the inhabitants of the house; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) Failing to replace the hot water system; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) Providing the premises with a hot water system which was unsafe; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) Providing a hot water system with insufficient pressure; 
        
       
       
        
        (g) Failing to heed the previous complaints of the said David Watkins that he water mixture in the shower was affected by other taps with the result that the temperature of that mixture substantially rose if other taps were turned on in the house; 
        
       
       
        
        (h) Failing to regularly inspect and maintain the said hot water system; 
        
       
       
        
        (i) Failing to replace the said hot water system which was a low pressure system with a mains pressure system.” 
        
       
       
      However, at trial, the Respondent’s case appeared to be directed solely to the last of those particulars. 
       
     8 In order to determine whether, in the circumstances, the Appellant ought reasonably to have replaced the hot water service, it is necessary to consider, first, the nature of the risk; second, the magnitude of the risk; and, third, all other relevant circumstances. 
     9 The nature of the risk was that, either, through his, or her, own carelessness, or as the result of another person in the house turning on a cold water tap at the same time, a person using hot water supplied by the hot water service might be burnt. 
     10 If I may say so, the evidence as to the magnitude of the risk is hardly satisfactory.  
     11 Much stress has been laid on Exhibit H (Blue AB 159), which in the transcript (Black AB 90) is described as “Report of Gordon Leslie Douglass”, and which purports to record the temperature readings taken by Mr. B.D. Moore at the premises at some stage in early March 1997. At the commencement of the hearing before Hosking DCJ there was considerable debate as to whether or not that “Report” was admissible, during the course of which debate – which included evidence on the voir dire – the Respondent’s then counsel said (inter alia) (Black AB 16): 
      
       
        
        “… Your Honour can I announce that one of the complaints was that no arrangements have been made by the defendant (sic) to have this witness Douglass available for cross-examination. We’ve made arrangements he can be here tomorrow …” 
        
       
       
      When, on the following day, Mr. Douglass was called to give evidence (Black AB 90-93), and it became clear that it was not he, but Mr. Moore, who was said to have made the readings, objection was taken to the tender of the “Report”. Despite the fact Mr. Moore’s whereabouts were known to Mr. Douglass (Black AB 91) and that there was no evidence that it would cause undue expense or undue delay or would not be reasonable and practicable for him to be called to give evidence (Evidence Act 1995 ss. 63, 64) his Honour permitted the “Report” to remain part of the evidence.  
       
     12 But, even if one treats the contents of the “Report” as part of the evidence, the weight to be given to the various readings is, to say the least, doubtful, for it is clear that the variations in temperature which are recorded where not instantaneous variations immediately following on the turning on of the tap elsewhere in the house, but were taken after Mr. Moore had turned that tap on “full bore” and then returned to the bathroom (Black AB 103-104).  
     13 Even then, some examination of the recorded temperatures is called for. The temperature of the hot water alone is said to have been 67° C, which is significantly below boiling point. What is said to have been a comfortable hot and cold temperature at the shower was 37° C (98.4° F) which is normal body temperature. It would seem that when the toilet was flushed the temperature increased to 39° C (102° F). When the cold tap was opened at basin, the temperature was said to increase to 45° C (113° F) and when the kitchen sink cold tap was turned out, the temperature was said to increased to 47° C (116.6° F). 
     14 In considering the magnitude of the risk, it is instructive to consider the extent to which the hot water service and, in particular, the shower and bath, have been used in the period between the family moving into the property in February 1990 and the date of the accident, a period of 6 years and 9 months, or roughly 2460 days. During that time each of the Respondent and her husband would have showered on a daily basis (Black AB 67). It addition, although, in the early years, the Respondent’s two daughters had baths which were drawn for them by either the Respondent or her husband, for about 4 years, or approximately 1400 days, from the age of 7, the Respondent’s elder daughter was accustomed to shower herself (Black AB 89) and for about a year or a little more, the Respondent’s younger daughter was also accustomed to shower herself (Black AB 89). In addition, hot water would be used on a daily basis for washing up the dishes and for the washing of clothes (Black AB 67-68). Despite all this use there was no evidence before Hosking DCJ that, at any time any member of the household had been burned by hot water.  
     15 In considering what the Appellant might reasonably have been required to do, the nature of the premises, of the hot water service and some aspects of the plumbing in the household, need to be considered. 
     16 The property appears to have been an older style detached cottage mainly of brick construction, situated in the South Western suburbs of Sydney (Black AB 28-29).  
     17 Hot water to the premises was provided by an off-peak hot water storage tank located in the roof void, the tank sitting in a metal tray fitted with a pipe leading to outside so that in the event of the flow overflowing water was discharged to the outside of the premises. Although water was fed into the tank under pressure from the cold water system as and when the tank emptied, the water was heated by a heater fitted to the tank, and to a temperature governed by a thermostat fitted to the tank, only during off peak hours. Hot water flowing from the tank did not flow under pressure but purely by force of gravity. One is, I think, entitled to know that, until comparatively recent times, in homes in which there was an electric hot water service, that service was provided by an off peak hot water storage tank. One is, I think, also entitled to know, that, until comparatively recent times, it was not possible, with such systems, to install devices which would automatically regulate the temperature of hot water delivered at individual outlets through the household.  
     18 At the time when the Respondent’s family moved into the premises, the bathroom did not have a shower recess separate from the bath, the shower head being fitted to the wall of the bathroom at the end of, and facing towards, the bath. As was common in such cases immediately above the end of the bath was a faucet capable of being operated by two taps, one for hot water and one for cold water, while the shower itself was capable of being operated by two further taps, one for hot water and one for cold water. Fitted above the bath and shower head was a railing which appears to have carried a shower curtain (Blue AB 6). If one wished to shower, one could thus adjust the temperature of the water from outside the bath and before entering the shower. 
     19 In the light of the evidence given by the Respondent as her husband as to the complaints which they said had been made as to the hot water system, upon which complaints Hosking DCJ placed stress, it is constructive to see what was recorded in the Appellant’s records, which records (Exhibit L) were tendered by the Respondent’s counsel at trial.  
     20 The first complaint was said to have been made over the telephone, according to the Respondent’s husband about 3 months, and according to the Respondent about 6 months, after the family moved into the house. The second “complaint” which was said to have been made at the time of the overflow from the hot water system, was said by the Respondent to have been made about 12 to 18 months after the family moved into the house. The third – written – complaint was said by the Respondent to have been made “about 92, 93, maybe sooner”. 
     21 The Appellant’s records (Blue AB 181) contain an entry for 23 July 1990 which clearly relates to the occasion when the hot water system overflowed. There is a further entry for 1 October 1990, relating to the hot water service which is difficult to decipher but which seems to indicate that there was no hot water. There is a further entry (Blue AB 183) for October 1994 which entry, by reference to an accompanying invoice (Blue AB 184) dated 4 October 1994, indicates that, at the time, a new heating element and new thermostat were supplied and installed in the hot water service. Although the Appellant’s records disclose other entries relating to repairs to and work carried out at the premises – as, for example, repairs to the electric stove and the electric range, and work clearing a choked sewer – the three entries to which I have earlier referred are the only entries relating to the hot water service between the time when the Respondent’s family moved into the premises and the accident.  
     22 The significance of these entries is, first, that the Appellant appears to have kept records of complaints made to, and of work done by, it to the premises; and, second, that, contrary to the evidence given by the Respondent and her husband to the effect that nothing was done after the written complaint had been made to the Appellant, in 1994 – presumably in response to some form of complaint or request made by the Respondent’s husband or the Respondent – some time after the time at which the written complaint was said to have been made, a new heater and a new thermostat were fitted to the hot water service. 
     23 What I have earlier written, in my view, indicates that whatever risk of injury arising from the use of the hot water service existed was not great, that the Appellant was accustomed to respond to complaints in an appropriate fashion; and that nothing further on its part was called for. 
     24 Much stress was placed by the Respondent upon what was said to be the fact that, after the accident, the Appellant removed the hot water system and substituted a mains pressure hot water system. Upon examination, however, it is clear, first, that the work which was done to the premises after the accident was not limited to a removal of the existing hot water service and its replacement by a mains pressure system; second, that the work that was done to the premises was not done in response to any complaint about the hot water service; and, third, that, in any event, the installation of a mains pressure hot water system would not have affected the temperature of water delivered to the shower or to any tap in the house.  
     25 The work which was done involved a full modification of the bathroom in the premises. As described by the Respondent in her evidence (Black AB 58-59): 
      
       
        
        “They gutted the bathroom completely, took the bath out, put in a disabled shower, raised the toilet, put tap handles in the bathroom, a hand held shower so I could sit down in the shower and have a shower. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        They put a new hot water service out the back instead of being in roof.” 
        
       
       
      (The nature of the bathroom as altered is shown in the photographs which form part of Exhibit F) (Blue AB 10-11) while the new heater (Exhibit E) (Blue AB 9) was a floor standing heater.)  
       
     26 The cost of the work involved, which work was carried out in June 1997 (Blue AB 180), and which cost included the cost of the hire of a shed to provide a toilet and shower while the work was being carried out (Blue AB 165) was in excess of $10,000.00 (Blue AB 165-166). 
     27 In the course of his examination in chief, the Respondent’s husband gave the following evidence (Black AB 101-102): 
      
       
        
        “Q. After the accident occurred to her did you do anything else about making a complaint about this hot water service? A. Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do this time? A. I rang the Department of Housing, I contacted my doctor and got an assistance letter from him. The occupational health therapist came out and gave us a little bit of advice on what was required around the bathroom. I then went to the Department of Housing with this letter, the advice from the occupational therapist. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And once again was any sort of form lodged? A. Yes, I filled out paper work and a form lodged. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And after that had been done did something happen to the hot water system? A. Yes. They sent out a gentleman, senior gentleman, from the Department, he inspected the house, the hot water system, flooring, the bath and approved for replacement of the hot water system and renovation of the bathroom with the bath being removed, rails installed to hold on anti slip floors.” 
        
       
       
      while in the course of his cross-examination the Respondent’s husband gave the following further evidence (Black AB 105-106): 
       
       
        
        “Q. And you made reference to the fact that after the accident you attended, would you say, your doctor? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who’s that? A. Dr. Huckstep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you tell Dr. Huckstep what had happened, did you? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did you say that a surge of hot water caused your wife to faint? A. No. I said my wife had broken her neck in the bathroom and we’d been complaining about different aspects of the bathroom for some time and shortly before I spoke to my doctor, the South West Area Health Service sent out an occupational therapist who checked our bathroom, etc and to see if it was okay for Vicki to come home from hospital and on her recommendation, because I discussed it with her, I said, look, I’ve had difficulty in the past to get anything done by the Department. How do you suggest – what – you know? She said, ‘Well, look just my recommendation alone may help you however it would also help if you got a letter from the doctor saying the Vicki’s now disabled and will have difficulty using the present facilities.’” 
        
       
       
      (Since the Respondent was discharged from hospital on 21 November 1996, the conversation with the occupational therapist must have taken place prior to that day.) 
       
     28 The “assistance letter” which, so the Respondent’s husband said he obtained from Dr. Huckstep, addressed to Dept of Housing and dated 2-12-96 was in the following terms (Black AB 203): 
      
       
        
        “Vicki Watkins is applying for renovation of her bathroom.  
        
       
       
        
        Vicki sustained a fracture/dislocation of her cervical spine in October (sic) 96. 
        
       
       
        
        Her neck was operatively repaired and she is now in a hard neck brace.  
        
       
       
        
        Considering the injury was sustained by Vicki whilst she was showering in the bath, perhaps this bath/shower combination could be renovated on medical grounds.” 
        
       
     29 It is, in my view, clear that the work which was carried out in June 1997 was not a response to a complaint about excessively hot water supplied by the hot water service, but a response to a request to have the bathroom renovated so as to accommodate the Respondent’s disabilities. 
     30 Finally, there is the question of the relevance, or otherwise, of the installation of a mains pressure hot water service and, in particular, the question whether if such a service had been installed prior to November 1996 that would, or might, have prevented the accident.  
     31 As I understand it, the fact that a hot water service is a mains pressure service refers only to the fact that from the hot water delivered from the heater tank is delivered at mains pressure, a fact which has no bearing whatsoever on the supply of cold water to any tap or shower head. If, as I believe to be the case, my understanding is correct, then the fact that no such system had been installed prior to November 1996 is irrelevant. 
     32 For these reasons, I would propose that the Appeal be upheld, the verdict and judgment below set aside and the Respondent ordered to pay the costs of the trial and of the appeal but to have a certificate under the Suitor’s Fund 1951. There should also be an order that the Respondent repay to the Appellant the moneys paid to her under the judgment together with interest thereon at the prescribed rate from 15 November 2000 until payment.  
     33 HEYDON JA: On 13 September 2000 Hosking DCJ, SC, gave a verdict and judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $636,923, and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs. This is an appeal by the defendant against those orders. The Notice of Appeal raises issues both of liability and of quantum.  
      
       
      Background 
       
     34 On 7 November 1996 at about 7.30am the plaintiff got into the shower at her home. Her home was a house leased by her husband from the defendant. It was occupied by the defendant, her husband and two daughters, who were then aged about 11 and 8. While she was in the shower, the water became hotter. She fell and fractured bones in her spine. The extent of her injuries may have been greatly worsened but for a fortunate circumstance – her husband knew how to treat injured people safely by reason of his occupation as a tow truck driver, and this enabled him to avoid further injury to her, and in particular, quadriplegia, while he cared for her before an ambulance came and took her to Liverpool Hospital.  
      
       
      The trial judge’s findings on liability 
       
     35 At the time of the accident the plaintiff was 37. She had been married most of her adult life. She and her family had occupied the premises from 1990 onwards.  
     36 The trial judge made express findings, or summarised the evidence in a manner indicating acceptance of it, in the following way: 
      
       
        
        “The premises had what has been described as a gravity fed hot water system which was located in the roof space of the cottage. This hot water system appears to have been of some age at the time the plaintiff, her husband and children moved into the property. 
        
       
       
        
        When they moved in, the plaintiff and Mr Watkins noticed that the plumbing system in the property delivered very hot water. The water was so hot that, according to the plaintiff (and corroborated by her husband) they could not put their hands under it without mixing cold water with it. 
        
       
       
        
        In addition, the hot water service was very sensitive in that the plaintiff said that they had to adjust the taps very accurately to obtain water of a bearable temperature to bathe in. 
        
       
       
        
        The plaintiff said that if she turned the hot water down a little whilst in the shower, the shower would go cold. She said that if, when the water was adjusted to a comfortable temperature she was in the shower and a cold tap was turned on elsewhere, the water in the shower would become a lot hotter, so much hotter as to be uncomfortable. She said that, at times, she felt obliged to shout out to other members of her family when she was under the shower not to turn cold water taps on or not to leave cold water taps turned on. The plaintiff said, ‘I told the kids from when they were little not to touch the water if anyone was in the shower’. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Watkins gave evidence that within a matter of weeks of moving into the premises he experienced what he described as a ‘hot spell’ whilst under the shower. He said, ‘It heated me up a little bit’ and that it was extremely hot causing him to have to step back out of the shower spray as he could not stand under it with that hot temperature. Mr Watkins said that it was discussed in the family that the taps should not be turned on if anyone was in the shower. Mr Watkins said that in his case at times he did turn on other taps in the house while somebody was in the shower, but he tried not to.” 
        
       
     37 The plaintiff and her husband made three complaints about the hot water system.  
     38 First, about six months after moving into the premises, her husband: 
      
       
        
        “rang the defendant’s Liverpool office. He asked the person to whom he spoke whether anything could be done about the hot water service because they were frightened that the children were going to get burnt from the hot water. In the result, nothing was done in response to that complaint.” 
        
       
     39 The second complaint was made in the following circumstances: 
      
       
        
        “at some time later a leak developed somewhere in the roof area and … water was running down from the water system on the outside of the roof. A plumber arrived to attend to the problem and told them that water was coming from ‘the overflow’. Both the plaintiff and Mr Watkins said that Mr Watkins asked the plumber whether there was any way that the temperature of the water heater could be turned down. However, despite that request it was not turned down.” 
        
       
       
      The trial judge declined to find that the plumber had reported that complaint back to the defendant. 
       
     40 The third complaint was made after the second, and about three years before the accident: 
      
       
        
        “the plaintiff and her husband went to the defendant’s Liverpool office and Mr Watkins filled out a form of some kind there in which he said that he wanted to complain about the hot water service because the water was becoming too hot. Both the plaintiff and Mr Watkins said that the completed form was handed to an officer of the Department of Housing at the desk at the Liverpool office however, again, no action was taken to remedy the problem.” 
        
       
       
      The plaintiff and her husband did not retain a copy of the form. The defendant did not produce the form. There is no evidence of what was recorded in the form.  
       
     41 The trial judge summarised the plaintiff’s evidence as to how the accident happened which, as will be seen, he accepted, as follows: 
      
       
        
        “The plaintiff said that she got into the shower and adjusted the temperature in the normal way and began showering. She said that she recalled whilst in the shower the hot water becoming hot. She said that her next recollection was waking up whilst prone in the bottom of the bath. She said that she had no recollection of how she fell and that she woke with her head on the back of the bath. She said she had then a pain in her neck and a pain in her lower back. She said she tried to pull herself up and felt sick. She called for assistance and apparently attracted the attention of one of her children, who, in turn, called her husband who came into the bathroom to assist her. Mr Watkins found the plaintiff lying in the bath tub face up and Mr Watkins lifted the plaintiff and took her into their bedroom. … 
        
       
       
        
        She was cross-examined about the circumstances of her fall. The plaintiff said she was not in a position to say what happened to the shower before she fainted. However, she could say that it went hot and that it was not at the temperature at which she set the shower when she first entered it. She said that she was facing towards the water and that she felt the water go hot almost instantaneously. She said she remembered it all down her front.” 
        
       
     42 The operative reasoning of the trial judge then proceeded as follows. 
     43 The trial judge noted the defendant’s concession that it owed the plaintiff a duty of care. 
     44 The trial judge also found that that duty of care was breached: 
      
       
        
        “there was a breach of the defendant’s duty of care because a system which contained water which was so hot and with taps and/or plumbing so sensitive that the turning on of a cold tap elsewhere in the house produced scalding water presented an obvious danger to occupants of the premises. I find as a fact that the defendant knew of this danger because the plaintiff’s husband had twice reported it to the Liverpool office.” 
        
       
     45 The trial judge then found that the defendant’s breach of duty caused the plaintiff’s fall. He said: 
      
       
        
        “a sudden burst of hot water from the shower was the immediate cause of the plaintiff’s fall. I have come to that conclusion for the following reasons: 
        
       
       
        
        1. The problem of hot water suddenly flowing from an outlet when a cold tap was turned on elsewhere was a condition which in fact existed in this house at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        2. There is evidence from Louise Watkins [the plaintiff’s daughter, then aged 8] that she turned on the cold tap when, unknown to her at the time the plaintiff was under the shower. That evidence was not contested. 
        
       
       
        
        3. That situation was likely to produce a rapid rise in the temperature of the water in the shower. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The plaintiff has said that she recalls being struck with hot water from the shower before her fall and, in my view the plaintiff appeared an honest and reliable witness. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Mr Moore, a plumber, took readings of the temperature under the shower head not too long after the accident occurred. He did so by turning on various other taps within the property in accordance with a report he prepared on the letterhead of Douglass Plumbing, 11 March 1997. Mr Moore recorded that the water temperature at the shower with the hot water tap on only was sixty seven degrees centigrade. He also said that a comfortable hot and cold temperature from the shower was a temperature of thirty seven degrees centigrade and that when the cold tap was turned on at the kitchen sink to the shower adjusted to a comfortable temperature the shower temperature increased to forty seven degrees centigrade, that is to say a rise of ten degrees. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Dr Conrad, as I indicated, said, and I accept that a rise in water temperature of that magnitude can cause a person to faint, especially a person such as the plaintiff who had low blood pressure.” 
        
       
       
      The trial judge said that material in the notes made by staff at Liverpool Hospital which pointed against the above findings should be discounted as containing inaccuracies caused by the plaintiff’s distress while being treated at the hospital. He also said that while it was possible that the plaintiff fell because of dizziness or vertigo occasioned by her low blood pressure, that was less probable as an explanation than “the sudden unexpected increase in temperature”. 
       
     46 Finally, the trial judge found that the damage suffered by the plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant: 
      
       
        
        “it was submitted for the defendant that the defendant was not on notice of the plaintiff’s condition of low blood pressure and that an injury of this kind was not foreseeable. In my view the plaintiff’s injury was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. It is true that the defendant would not have known of the plaintiff’s low blood pressure but it was foreseeable that a sudden burst of very hot water could have come from the shower head. As was submitted for the plaintiff, once the danger is present it does not matter that the precise mechanism of the accident may not have been foreseen and I agree with the plaintiff’s submission that even if the plaintiff had slipped while trying to get away from a sudden burst of hot water, the defendant would have been nonetheless liable.” 
        
       
       
      The parties’ contentions in outline 
       
     47 At a simple factual level the case of the plaintiff in substance was as follows. The structure of the hot water system meant that a user of the shower could not stand in it if a cold tap was turned on elsewhere in the house because that produced a sudden and sharp rise in temperature, and was such that that user had to move out of the water hastily. The hot water system was thus unsafe and dangerous. The Watkins family perceived this to be so great a problem that they made three complaints about it, two direct to the defendant and one to a plumber sent by the defendant. Further, the family perceived the problem to be so serious that a strict rule was introduced that no cold tap was to be turned on while anyone was in the shower. The trial judge found that the change in temperature at 7.30am on 7 November 1996 caused the plaintiff’s injuries, and paragraph 3 of the Notice of Appeal, which challenged that conclusion, was abandoned in written submissions. The problem was overcome after the accident by the substitution of the old hot water system by a mains pressure hot water system and there was no evidence that that was unduly expensive. In essence the trial judge accepted that case.  
     48 There were many aspects of the trial judge’s reasoning which the defendant did not challenge on appeal. The response of the defendant to the trial judge’s reasoning and to the plaintiff’s case operated at two levels. 
     49 The first response of the defendant was at a factual level of equal simplicity to that which the plaintiff employed. The defendant said that the Watkins family cannot have perceived the hot water system to be dangerous because they only complained three times in six years and they did not follow up the complaints. Further, the plaintiff persistently showered when she could have taken baths in the same way that her daughters did. The plaintiff had had about 1500 showers before the accident without any incident and without slipping and falling. In short, the defect in the hot water system was not perceived to be, and was not, a matter of real consequence; it was no more than annoying and inconvenient. Hence the hot water system was not unsafe, harmful or dangerous.  
     50 It might well be said that the items of evidence on which the defendant’s conclusion is based, whether or not they are strong enough to support it, show at least that the plaintiff’s case, if it is to succeed, requires the court to proceed close to the extreme limits of recovery. That is because the type of problem experienced with the hot water system is a not uncommon one in many Australian houses. While it is possible that all persons injured as the plaintiff was have a valid claim in negligence, that possibility calls for a close analysis of the legal reasoning employed and not employed by the trial judge. It was that analysis which the defendant embarked on in its second level of response to the plaintiff’s argument with a view to showing that the plaintiff was seeking to proceed not merely close to the extreme limits of recovery, but over them.  
     51 The defendant’s arguments in relation to the second level of its response may be grouped as follows. The defendant said, first, that the trial judge failed to identify or define the extent or scope of the duty of care which he found the defendant to have breached. Secondly, the defendant said that the plaintiff had failed to prove, or even tender any evidence at all to prove, what standard of care was appropriate for the defendant. Thirdly, the defendant said that the trial judge determined the issue of breach solely by reference to foreseeability of a risk of injury to the plaintiff, and paid no regard to a reasonable man’s response to the risk created by evaluating the magnitude of the risk and the degree of probability of its occurrence; the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action; and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant had. Fourthly, the defendant said that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was too remote because it was not reasonably foreseeable: even assuming that it was reasonably foreseeable that a rise in water temperature might cause a user of the shower to slip, fall and thereby suffer physical injury, it was not reasonably foreseeable that it would have a psychological impact causing a vaso vagal attack in the manner which Dr Peter Conrad, whose evidence the trial judge appeared to accept, thought had happened.  
     52 There is one issue that arises out of the contest between the parties at a factual level that could have significance for the determination of the legal issues raised by the defendant. That relates to the temperature of the water under the shower after a cold tap was turned on elsewhere in the house. It is therefore convenient to deal with that issue at the outset. 
      
       
      Was the water “scalding”? 
       
     53 The trial judge, in concluding that the defendant was in breach of duty, said that the water under the shower became “scalding” when a cold tap was turned on elsewhere. Elsewhere he called it “very hot” and “hot”. He also said that there was “a rapid rise in the temperature” and described that rise as “sudden”.  
     54 The defendant’s argument about the finding that the water was “scalding” was that the only evidence supporting it was that of Dr Conrad in his report of 12 March 1998. That report contained the following description of the accident: 
      
       
        
        “Apparently the hot water system malfunctioned and [the plaintiff] was suddenly [scalded] with hot water from the shower and as a result she blacked out.”  
        
       
       
      In cross-examination Dr Conrad said that the word “scalded” would have been the plaintiff’s word. He explained his understanding of it thus: 
       
       
        
        “it is hot temperature which is uncomfortable and causes some painful reaction, that is my understanding and with scalding it usually means a hot liquid that is my understanding, but it is a lay term”.  
        
       
     55 The defendant then submitted that there was a disconformity between what the plaintiff told Dr Conrad and what she and her husband told the court. The defendant pointed to the following descriptions given by the plaintiff or her husband of the temperature of the water either during the general operation of the system or when the accident happened: “Uncomfortable” (Black 30E), “too hot” (Black 32D), “the hot water going hot” (Black 34L), “the water [got] hot” (Black 69W), “experienced a hot spell under the shower [which] heated me up a little bit” so that the water felt “Extremely hot. I had to step back from the shower and sort of go to turn it down. I couldn’t actually stand under it” (Black 95B-E). The defendant also pointed to evidence from the plaintiff that she had never burned herself in the hot water (Black 64X). The defendant noted that on or about 11 March 1997 a plumber, Mr Moore, measured a rise in the water temperature of the shower from 370C to 470C when the kitchen sink cold tap was turned on (Blue 159). That rise was not measured instantaneously: the reading of 470C was made about ten seconds after Mr Moore had turned the kitchen sink cold tap on, in which period of time he moved from the kitchen to the bathroom (Black 103L-104M). Finally, the defendant said that “no witness was asked about, nor did any of them speak to, the capacity of water in the subject premises to inflict pain, blister skin, or otherwise cause physical harm.”  
     56 On the other hand, there was evidence suggesting that the rise in temperature was acute. The plaintiff’s husband said in his first complaint to the defendant “Suddenly it will go hot in our house” (emphasis added: Black 95P). The plaintiff said that in that complaint her husband “asked the housing commission if there was anything they could do about the hot water service because we were frightened that the kids were going to get burnt” (Black 30V). The plaintiff’s husband described his second complaint, to the plumber, thus: 
      
       
        
        “I asked him if he could take a look at any of the problems that were concerning us regarding the suddenly reaching hot temperatures and whether or not he could do anything about adjusting the system or something … “  
        (Black 96L-M) 
        
       
     57 “Scalding”, “scald” and “scalded” are words with a range of meanings in the present context. At one end of the range, to “be scalded” means to be burnt with hot liquid just short of boiling point or with steam. At the other end of the range, to “be scalded” is to be affected painfully by hot liquid. The evidence gives no support to the view that turning on a cold tap in one part of the house produced water in the shower which was “scalding” in the sense of being just short of boiling point. Indeed it is highly improbable that the water produced by turning on the hot tap but not the cold was ever “scalding” in that sense, and Mr Morris’ reading was only 670C. However, the evidence does suggest that the water was scalding in the sense that it had had a painful effect on the user of the shower, and one reason for the painfulness of the effect was the suddenness in the change of temperature. It seems likely that that was what the trial judge meant by “scalding”, because he said of the plaintiff’s evidence: 
      
       
        
        “She said that while the hot water service concerned her because it was simply too hot and that at times she had to pull her hand away because the hot water was uncomfortable, that she had, never in fact, burned herself. I infer that no other member of her family was actually burned by the hot water either.” 
        
       
       
      Accordingly, while the defendant is correct in submitting that the water was not “scalding” in an extreme sense of that word, it does not follow that it was no more than inconvenient. A sudden change in temperature was capable of causing a user of the shower to seek to move away very quickly, and it remains an open possibility that that led to a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm.  
       
       
      The role of foreseeability  
       
     58 Before proceeding to consider the four heads under which the defendant grouped its legal arguments, it is convenient to set out a passage from Minister Administering the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act, 1979 v San Sebastian Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 268 at 295-296 on which the defendant relied. Glass JA there said: 
      
       
        
        “Since the proximity relationship permeates much of the discussion which follows, it is as well to say something at this point about ‘the foreseeability of the plaintiff’s damage’ which is sometimes equated with it. The blunt notion that they are interchangeable, although encouraged by earlier decisions, has been sharpened by subsequent analysis which has rejected ambivalent terms such as likely and unlikely and displaced reasonable foreseeability in favour of the more precise term reasonably foreseeable possibility. Coupled with this a recognition has emerged that the foreseeability inquiry at the duty, breach and remoteness stages raises different issues which progressively decline from the general to the particular. The proximity upon which a  
        Donoghue 
         type duty rests depends upon proof that the defendant and plaintiff are so placed in relation to each other that it is reasonably foreseeable as a possibility that careless conduct of  
        any kind 
         on the part of the former may result in damage of  
        some kind 
         to the person or property of the latter:  
        Chapman v Hearse 
         (1961) 106 CLR 112, at 120, 121. The breach question requires proof that it was reasonably foreseeable as a possibility that  
        the kind 
         of carelessness charged against the defendant might cause damage of  
        some kind 
         to the plaintiff’s person or property:  
        Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Miller Steamship Co Pty Ltd; The Wagon Mound (No 2) 
         [1967] AC 617, at 642, 643,  
        Wyong Shire Council v Shirt 
         (1980) 54 ALJR 283, at 285, 286; 29 ALR 217, at 219-222. Of course, it must additionally be proved that a means of obviating that possibility was available and would have been adopted by a reasonable defendant, ibid. The remoteness test is only passed if the plaintiff proves that  
        the kind 
         of damage suffered by him was foreseeable as a possible outcome of  
        the kind 
         of carelessness charged against the defendant:  
        Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey 
         (1970) 125 CLR 383, at 390.” 
        
       
     59 One difficulty with this passage is that it may assume that “proximity” is an essential element in liability for negligent acts. To the extent that it did make that assumption, it received some support from later High Court authority. But in Sullivan v Moody (2001) 183 ALR 404 at [43]-[48] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ indicated that the role of “proximity” is a limited one. They said: 
      
       
        
        “In  
        Donoghue v Stevenson 
         [[1932] AC 562], the House of Lords, by a majority of three to two, held that such a duty was owed by the manufacturer of a beverage to a consumer of a beverage where the manufacturer sold the product to a distributor and it was ultimately sold to the consumer in circumstances such that the consumer could not discover a defect in the beverage by inspection. It was established that it was not necessary for a plaintiff to show that a case was covered by, or closely analogous to, existing precedent, and that there were general principles by reference to which a claim in negligence fell to be decided. The first principle was that, in order to support an action for damages for negligence, a plaintiff must ‘show that he has been injured by the breach of a duty owed to him in the circumstances by the defendant to take reasonable care to avoid such injury’ [[1932] AC 562 at 579 per Lord Atkin].  
        
       
       
        
        Lord Atkin, noting how difficult it was to find in the authorities statements of general application defining the relations between parties that gave rise to that duty, and pointing out that there must be some element common to all the particular relations which had been held to involve a duty said [[1932] AC 562 at 580]: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘To seek a complete logical definition of the general principle is probably to go beyond the function of the judge, for the more general the definition the more likely it is to omit essentials or to introduce non-essentials. The attempt was made by Brett MR in  
          Heaven v Pender 
          , in a definition to which I will later refer. As framed, it was demonstrably too wide, though it appears to me, if properly limited, to be capable of affording a valuable practical guide’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Heaven v Pender 
        , Brett MR, addressing the question what is the proper definition of the relation between two persons which imposes on one of them a duty to observe, with regard to the person or property of the other, care to prevent injury, said [(1883) 11 QBD 503 at 509]: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘… whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense who did think would at once recognise that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct with regard to those circumstances he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Ten years later, in  
        Le Lievre v Gould 
         [[1893] 1 QB 491 at 504] A L Smith LJ described that as a statement of principle ‘that a duty to take due care [arose] when the person or property of one was in such proximity to the person or property of another that, if due care was not taken, damage might be done by the one to the other’. That statement appears to refer to a limited form of proximity: proximity of person or property. But Lord Atkin said that it was not to be understood as limited to physical proximity. It was intended ‘to extend to such close and direct relations that the act complained of directly affects a person whom the person alleged to be bound to take care would know would be directly affected by his careless act’ [[1932] AC 562 at 581]. Even so, his Lordship was speaking of ‘close and direct relations’. He went on to acknowledge that there will no doubt be ‘cases where it will be difficult to determine whether the contemplated relationship is so close that the duty arises’ [[1932] AC 562 at 582]. 
        
       
       
        
        The references to ‘relations’, and to the problem of deciding which relations are sufficiently proximate to give rise to a duty of care, in part reflects the previous history of the law of negligence, the focus of attention often being particular categories of relationship. The search was for a unifying principle which informed the decisions in respect to those categories. The actual conclusion in  
        Donoghue v Stevenson 
         was that, at least in certain circumstances, the manufacturer of a product intended for human consumption stood in a sufficiently proximate relation to an ultimate consumer of the product to attract a duty of care. But Lord Atkin, in his formulation of principle, was seeking to find ‘a valuable practical guide’, and warned against ‘the danger of stating propositions of law in wider terms than is necessary’ [[1932] AC 562 at 583-584]. Consistently with his reasoning, he might also have warned against the danger of stating such propositions in more categorical terms than is appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        As Professor Fleming said [Fleming, 
         The Law of Torts 
        , 9th ed, (1998) at 151], ‘no one has ever succeeded in capturing in any precise formula’ a comprehensive test for determining whether there exists, between two parties, a relationship sufficiently proximate to give rise to a duty of care of the kind necessary for actionable negligence. The formula is not ‘proximity’. Notwithstanding the centrality of that concept, for more than a century, in this area of discourse, and despite some later decisions in this Court which emphasised that centrality [eg  
        Jaensch v Coffey 
         (1984) 155 CLR 549 especially at 584-585 per Deane J;  
        Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd 
         (1986) 160 CLR 16 at 52 per Deane J], it gives little practical guidance in determining whether a duty of care exists in cases that are not analogous to cases in which a duty has been established [ 
        Hawkins v Clayton 
         (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 555-556 per Brennan J;  
        Hill v Van Erp 
         (1997) 188 CLR 159 at 210 per McHugh J;  
        Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee 
         (1999) 200 CLR 1 at 96-97 [270]-[274] per Hayne J]. It expresses the nature of what is in issue, and in that respect gives focus to the inquiry, but as an explanation of a process of reasoning leading to a conclusion its utility is limited.” 
        
       
     60 Another matter to be borne in mind in considering Glass JA’s analysis is that he regarded reasonable foreseeability as an “undemanding” standard (Shirt v Wyong Shire Council [1978] 1 NSWLR 631 at 641). That particular view is a view which the law in future, and indeed perhaps at present, may not reflect. 
     61 It must also be remembered that reasonable foreseeability is a necessary condition for liability, not a sufficient condition.  
     62 Subject to those caveats, the analysis of Glass JA must be given the deep respect any pronouncement of his, particularly in the field of personal injury litigation, deserves. Indeed, though the defendant said it could not point to any authority applying Glass JA’s analysis, there is some support for it. Thus in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47 Mason J said that “foreseeability in connection with the existence of the duty of care” involved “a more generalised inquiry” than “foreseeability in the context of breach of duty”. See also Bus v Sydney County Council (unreported, 4 April 1986, NSWSC), where at p 15 Wood J said he found the analysis to be “of considerable assistance”; G G Rudge v Murray Tractors Importers Pty Ltd (unreported, 9 November 1989, NSWCA) per Hope AJA at p 9, Gleeson CJ and Meagher JA concurring; Miletic v Capital Health Commission (1992) 108 FLR 213 at 215-216 per Higgins J; and Ratcliffe v Jackson (unreported, 27 May 1993, Tas FC) at p 7 per Underwood J.  
      
       
      Failure to define the scope of the duty 
       
     63 At the trial the defendant admitted that it owed the plaintiff a duty of care. By itself this did little to narrow the controversy. Defendants in negligence litigation, like lawyers discussing the tort of negligence, sometimes treat the duty of care as a very general matter which is given content only by debate about what the appropriate standard of care imposed by that duty is. On the other hand, sometimes analysis of the existence of a duty of care proceeds concurrently with inquiries into what its content or standard is.  
     64 The defendant’s written submissions proceeded as follows. The general submission was that the trial judge “failed to identify or define the content or scope of the duty of care breach of which he found”. The defendant then said: “Until the nature, quality or extent of the duty is so defined, it is not possible to say whether reasonable care has been taken to fulfil that duty which is owed”. This submission was supported by reference to various cases. As the defendant said in a written submission filed after the close of argument, one of them has been attacked to some degree in the High Court since. Further, the approach taken in another has been overruled in a case decided after the close of argument, namely Sullivan v Moody (2001) 183 ALR 404. However, the proposition advanced is not controversial. The defendant then said: 
      
       
        
        “The content of the duty of care owed by a landlord to a non-tenant occupant was considered by the High  
         
        Court in  
        Jones v Bartlett & Anor 
         (2000) HCA 56; (2000) Aust Torts Reps 81-582; see in particular Gleeson CJ at para 56 – ‘the duty was a duty to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risk of injury to the appellant; the practical extent of the duty was governed by the circumstances of the case’; Gummow and Hayne JJ at paras 195-197. 
        
       
       
        
        The learned trial judge, having failed to identify the circumstances of the case and the manner in which, viewed prospectively, they called for reasonable steps to be taken by the defendant/landlord, failed to decide a critical and essential pre-condition to the imposition of liability upon the defendant.” 
        
       
     65 In oral argument the defendant referred to the following observation of Mahoney JA in Phillis v Daly (1988) 15 NSWLR 65 at 74, which was quoted by Gleeson CJ in Jones v Bartlett (2000) 176 ALR 137 at [24]: 
      
       
        
        “There are dangers on any premises. A room may have a desk or a table. There is a danger that, if I fall, I will hit my head on it and my skull will be fractured. If the desk or table were not there, I would suffer little or no harm. And the danger is obvious: people do slip and fall. And the injury may be serious. But the obvious foreseeability of such an injury and its seriousness does not involve that, if a person falls and hits his head on a table, there must have been a breach of duty by the occupier of the room. And this notwithstanding that people may live without tables and that tables may be easily removed.” 
        
       
       
      The defendant also quoted the following remarks of Gleeson CJ in  
      Jones v Bartlett 
       at [25]-[26]: 
       
       
        
        “It is interesting, and not without relevance, to speculate about how many objects in and around an ordinary dwelling house would constitute a potential hazard to a person who behaved as carelessly as the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not accept that the condition of the respondents’ premises was shown to be defective in any relevant sense.” 
        
       
     66 Those passages do not appear to be of much relevance to the present controversy. There was no contention on the appeal that the plaintiff had behaved carelessly. The trial judge rejected contributory negligence at the trial and the Notice of Appeal did not challenge this finding.  
     67 What was the content of the duty for which the plaintiff contended at the trial? The Statement of Claim made the following allegation: 
      
       
        
        “In the circumstances the defendant was under a duty of care to the plaintiff and was in breach thereof and was negligent. 
        
       
       
        
        PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Failing to take any or any adequate precautions for the plaintiff’s safety; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Putting the plaintiff in a position of peril in the circumstances; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Failing to ensure that the shower within the premises was safe for use by the inhabitants of the house; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) Failing to replace the hot water system; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) Providing the premises with a hot water system which was unsafe; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) Providing a hot water system with insufficient pressure; 
        
       
       
        
        (g) Failing to heed the previous complaints of the said David Watkins that the water mixture in the shower was affected by other taps with the result that the temperature of that mixture substantially rose if other taps were turned on in the house; 
        
       
       
        
        (h) Failing to regularly inspect and maintain the said hot water system; 
        
       
       
        
        (i) Failing to replace the said hot water system which was a low pressure system with a mains pressure system.” 
        
       
       
      What the particulars boil down to is an allegation that the hot water system should have been either repaired or replaced. While the trial judge did not appear explicitly to state what the content or measure of the duty of care was, he does appear to have thought that the duty called for either repair or replacement of the hot water system. Even if he did not turn his mind to that question, it is open to this Court to formulate the content of the duty of care for itself. Assuming everything else in the plaintiff’s favour, the content of the duty of care was such as, in the circumstances, to call for repair or replacement of the hot water system. 
       
       
      Lack of evidence of appropriate standard of care 
     68 The defendant said, citing Neill v NSW Fresh Food and Ice Pty Ltd (1963) 108 CLR 362, that it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove what standard of care was appropriate for a landlord in the position of the defendant, and there was not “a jot of evidence” on this issue.  
     69 Neill’s case was a case in which an injured workman who slipped while cleaning a milk tank contended that there was a defect in the system of work on which he was engaged, but called no evidence as to what steps could have been taken to minimise or eliminate the risk of slipping. A jury verdict in his favour was overturned by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the High Court dismissed an appeal. They held that the case was not one in which the application of common knowledge justified a finding that the system of work was defective, and, in the absence of evidence as to what steps, if any, might have been taken to minimise or eliminate the risk of injury in the performance of the work, the verdict entered for the plaintiff could not be supported. Taylor and Owen JJ, for example, said at 368-369: 
      
       
        
        “No doubt in many cases no more than common knowledge, or perhaps common sense, is necessary to enable one to perceive the existence of a real risk of injury and to permit one to say what reasonable and appropriate precautions might appropriately be taken to avoid it. …  
        
       
       
        
        …. [The] evidence must be such as to justify a finding of negligence on the part of the employer and, if the negligence alleged is in relation to the system of work employed, the evidentiary material must be such as to enable the jury to find that the system unreasonably exposed the workman to risk of injury. …. Whether or not there has been such a failure on the part of the employer may, in some cases be resolved, by the application of common knowledge; in others it may be necessary to show a departure from long-established practice in the type of work under consideration or by showing that an appropriate method which would eliminate or minimise the risk was reasonably available.” 
        
       
     70 The question which the defendant’s submission poses is whether it is possible to say, as a result of applying common knowledge and without specific evidence of unreasonable exposure to a risk of injury, that there was “a real risk of injury”. Referring to the second type of foreseeability described by Glass JA in the San Sebastian case, the defendant said: 
      
       
        
        “all that has to be satisfied at the breach inquiry stage is that failing to replace the hot water service might cause as a possibility some kind of damage. I don’t concede it but one might conclude if there is an extremely significant change in temperature one might recoil and in a bath might slip and fall and thereby suffer bruises or more serious injury, some kind of damage, it’s a generalised inquiry as to the damage suffered.” 
        
       
       
      To arrive at the conclusion that the user of the shower might, if the turning on of a cold tap caused the water temperature to rise so suddenly and to such a level that that user would feel the need, as the plaintiff’s husband said he did, to step back from the shower, does not call for specific evidence that that creates exposure to a risk of injury. Arrival at that conclusion is capable of being based on common knowledge. Hence the defendant’s argument fails. Of course, whether the employment of common knowledge would in fact cause one to arrive at the conclusion is a different question to be answered under the next heading.  
       
       
      Failure to apply the breach of duty “calculus” 
       
     71 The defendant’s submission was that the trial judge determined the question of breach of duty solely by reference to foreseeability, and paid no attention to what was described as the “’calculus of negligence’ prescribed by the High Court in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt” (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48.  
     72 Mason J’s formulation in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt, which largely corresponds with earlier formulations such as that of Dixon CJ and Kitto J in Hamilton v Nuroof (WA) Pty Ltd (1956) 96 CLR 18 at 26, though much-cited, bears repetition: 
      
       
        
        “In deciding whether there has been a breach of the duty of care the tribunal of fact must first ask itself whether a reasonable man in the defendant’s position would have foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff. If the answer be in the affirmative, it is then for the tribunal of fact to determine what a reasonable man would do by way of response to the risk. The perception of the reasonable man’s response calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have. It is only when these matters are balanced out that the tribunal of fact can confidently assert what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in the defendant’s position. 
        
       
       
        
        The considerations to which I have referred indicate that a risk of injury which is remote in the sense that it is extremely unlikely to occur may nevertheless constitute a foreseeable risk. A risk which is not far-fetched or fanciful is real and therefore foreseeable. But, as we have seen, the existence of a foreseeable risk of injury does not in itself dispose of the question of breach of duty. The magnitude of the risk and its degree of probability remain to be considered with other relevant factors.” 
        
       
       
      The point of the passage was pithily summarised by Mahoney JA in  
      Mitchell v Government Insurance Office (NSW) 
       (1992) 15 MVR 369 at 379: “the fact that there is a foreseeable risk of injury does not, as such, require that precautions be taken against it”. 
       
     73 As this head of argument was developed, the defendant advanced two points. 
     74 The first point was that in this case the plaintiff failed even to get to Mason J’s starting point. That is, it was submitted that the plaintiff had not established any reasonably foreseeable possibility that the kind of carelessness charged against the defendant (failing to repair or replace the hot water system) might cause damage of some kind to the plaintiff’s person or property. That submission is to be rejected. In rejecting it it is necessary to take into account common experience. It is also necessary to take into account the fact that the defendant had been asked by the plaintiff’s husband on the telephone whether anything could be done about the hot water service because the plaintiff and her husband were frightened that their children were going to get burned by reason of the suddenness of the change in temperature. It is also, finally, necessary to take into account the fact that the plaintiff’s husband made a written report to the defendant about the hot water system after attending with the plaintiff at the defendant’s offices and saying “he wanted to complain about the hot water service because it was getting too hot when you turned the cold taps on [i.e. in other parts of the house]” (Black 32D). Taking those matters into account, there was a risk reasonably foreseeable to a reasonable person in the position of the defendant that if, while the shower was being used, a cold tap was turned on in another part of the house, the water temperature in the shower would rise so suddenly and to such a degree that the user of the shower would step back hastily and might slip and fall, causing injury. The defendant submitted that the change in temperature was uncomfortable, annoying and inconvenient, not harmful or dangerous. That poses a false dichotomy. While a stoic might have been able to stay under the shower without actually suffering physical injury, or anything more than transient pain, the natural human reaction would have been to do what the plaintiff’s husband did and move out of the water. Staying under the water itself may not have been dangerous; but the changed temperature would cause most people to move suddenly, and that step carried dangers.  
     75 The defendant reminded this Court that reasonable foresight could not depend on “attributes which properly belong to a person of exceptional perspicuity and foresight”: Hawkins v Coulsdon and Purley Urban District Council [1954] 1 QB 319 at 327 per Somervell LJ. The defendant also reminded the court that reasonable foresight could not depend on possession of “super-human qualities of imagination and foresight” or on being “a person of ‘infinite-resource-and-sagacity”: Rae v The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1957) 97 CLR 419 at 422 per Fullagar J. The defendant, acting reasonably, was not called on to exercise exceptional perspicuity or possess super-human qualities of imagination or have infinite resource and capacity in order to foresee the danger of damage of some kind to the plaintiff.  
     76 The defendant’s second point was that the trial judge had not assessed the magnitude of the risk or the degree of probability of its occurrence; the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action; and the pressure of other conflicting responsibilities. The defendant said: 
      
       
        
        “Nowhere in the evidence was it established whether there was any, and if so what, practicable alternative in the circumstances of this case which was such that a reasonable man in the position of the defendant would be judged as required to implement in the circumstances known to the plaintiff’s injury.  
        All 
         that was proved was that there existed a not uncommon, annoying plumbing condition of which the defendant was informed about three years before the plaintiff’s fall.” 
        
       
     77 The defendant is correct in submitting that the trial judge did not engage in any explicit analysis along the lines contemplated by Mason J. The first question is thus whether this Court is in a position to do so. Since the matter does not turn on disputed issues of credit, it is. The second question is what the outcome of that process should be. 
     78 One difficulty with the defendant’s argument is that after the accident the defendant removed the hot water system and substituted a mains pressure hot water system. This change is not of itself evidence of negligence: Hart v Lancashire & Yorkshire Rail Co (1869) 21 LT 261 at 263; Davis v Langdon (1911) 11 SR (NSW) 149. The change is “relevant not to what should have been done but to what could have been done”: Glass, McHugh and Douglas, The Liability of Employers (2nd ed), p 35. This Court was not taken to any evidence of the cost of that change in the hot water system. The legal burden of proving a breach of duty lay on the plaintiff. That in turn meant that the plaintiff bore a legal burden of proving that in all the circumstances it was unreasonable for the defendant not to take the precaution of changing the hot water system before the accident in the way it did after the accident. Even if the plaintiff as a result bore a burden of proof in relation to negating expense, difficulty and inconvenience of making the change, the observations of Gibbs J (with whom Stephen J and Mason J agreed) in Nelson v John Lysaght (Australia) Ltd (1975) 132 CLR 201 at 214-215 are relevant: 
      
       
        
        “the appellant has shown that it was practicable to provide a new method of doing the work that would eliminate or minimize the risk, because such a new method has in fact been put into operation. In determining whether a reasonable employer would have provided such a new system it would be necessary to consider not only the degree of risk of accident and injury likely to result if no such provision were made, but also the disadvantages, if any, of taking the suggested precaution … . The onus of proving that it was unreasonable not to take the precaution, of course, lay on the appellant. However, when the respondent, which must have had full knowledge of the nature, cost and practical consequences of the new installation, gave no evidence, and by its counsel asked no questions, to suggest that it was inordinately expensive or in any other way disadvantageous, the jury was entitled to infer at the very least that the advantages of the method which the respondent has since adopted were not outweighed by any disadvantages.” 
        
       
     79 So here, the defendant would have known the nature, cost and practical consequences – the “expense, difficulty and inconvenience” – of the change. Its failure to call evidence on these questions justifies an inference that the advantages of the new system were not outweighed by any disadvantages.  
     80 But it is questionable whether the plaintiff did bear a burden of negating expense, difficulty and inconvenience. Those issues on which one or other party bears a legal burden of proof are factual issues on which the validity of the cause of action or ground of defence depends. According to J B Thayer’s Preliminary Treatise on Evidence of the Common Law (Boston, Little Brown & Co, 1898), p 355, what is known in modern Australian law as the legal burden of proof is the: 
      
       
        
        “peculiar duty of him who has the risk of any given proposition on which the parties are at issue, - who will lose the case if he does not make this proposition out, when all has been said and done.” 
        
       
       
      A plaintiff bears the burden of proving facts constituting a cause of action (for example, in a contract case, agreement on particular terms, intention to affect legal relations, and either a seal or consideration). A defendant bears the burden of proving the constituent facts of a defence which would defeat the cause of action alleged (for example, in a contract case, illegality or accord and satisfaction). But that there is little expense in alleviating a risk is not a fact on which either side bears a legal burden of proof in a negligence case: it is not a matter which, if not established, will cause a plaintiff to lose. It is a matter which, if established, assists a plaintiff in succeeding in discharging the burden that that plaintiff bears of proving breach. It is a matter which, if negated by the defendant, assists the defendant in preventing the plaintiff from discharging the plaintiff’s burden of proving breach. But it is not a matter success on which is crucial to either party, because it is simply one factor among several to be considered in assessing the response of a reasonable man to the risk.  
       
     81 An application by this Court of the process by which a reasonable man’s response to the risk is to be assessed operates as follows. 
     82 First, the risk of injury at least by slipping and falling was of a degree considerably greater than that sufficient just to cross the line separating the far-fetched and fanciful from the reasonably foreseeable. 
     83 Secondly, if the reasonably foreseeable risk came to pass, it was capable of having very serious consequences. Persons who slip in baths can kill themselves, and sometimes do. They can also break their necks and become quadriplegics, whether because of the direct impact of the fall or because of inappropriate handling just after they have fallen. The potential degree of injury in many of the instances across a full range of instances was grave.  
     84 Thirdly, the change made by the defendant to the hot water system and its conduct of the case make it safe to infer that there would have been no significant expense, difficulty or inconvenience in changing the hot water system before the accident. 
     85 Fourthly, the defendant pleaded in paragraph 6 of its Defence: 
      
       
        
        “the Defendant says that as a government authority with a limited budget with which it is necessarily required to balance competing demands of individual client tenants and their visitors with other community interests, it at all times acted as reasonably as could possibly be expected of it in the circumstances.” 
        
       
       
      Though the defendant’s conduct in pleading this matter was entirely correct, it does not follow that it bore any legal burden of proof. It certainly called no evidence on the point. Nor, for her part, did the plaintiff. There being an evidentiary vacuum, this factor does not count for or against the plaintiff on the material fact which she bore the legal burden of proving, namely, breach of duty. So far as the plaintiff bore a legal onus of proving that there were no conflicting responsibilities, she did not discharge it, but it does not follow from that that there were conflicting responsibilities. Further, it is questionable whether the plaintiff did bear a legal onus of proving that the defendant did not have any conflicting responsibilities. The reasons for questioning that proposition are similar to those discussed above in relation to the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of alleviation.  
       
     86 The defendant’s argument that because the trial judge failed to pay attention to the “calculus of negligence” as described in Shirt’s case it should succeed fails, because when that “calculus” is considered, the outcome is adverse to the defendant.  
      
       
      Foreseeability in the remoteness sense 
       
     87 The defendant argued that the reasonable foreseeability test which Glass JA said must be satisfied in relation to remoteness was not satisfied. That test was that the plaintiff had to prove that the “kind” of damage suffered was foreseeable as a possible outcome of the “kind” of carelessness charged against the defendant. The defendant relied on Barwick CJ’s words in Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey (1970) 125 CLR 383 at 390: “the rarity of … an injury in the circumstances does not … deny the foreseeability of an injury of the class of which it forms one. That it is sufficient that the class of injury as distinct from the particular injury ought to be foreseen as a possible consequence of particular conduct in order to establish liability for damages for the particular injury is well established.” The defendant also relied on Windeyer J’s statement at 402: “Liability for nervous shock depends on foreseeability of nervous shock.” The defendant argued that the “kind” of damage which the plaintiff suffered was a “psychological shock precipitating a faint”. The defendant said that it was that consequence which had to be reasonably foreseeable. The defendant conceded that if that consequence were reasonably foreseeable, it could not complain if as a further (perhaps unforeseeable) consequence, the plaintiff fell and was injured. But the defendant argued that on no basis could it be said that a person in the position of the defendant could reasonably foresee as a consequence of the unsatisfactory operation of the hot water system that there would be “a psychological shock precipitating a faint”. The defendant argued that while Dr Conrad could have foreseen it (by reason of forty years’ professional experience, unsupported though it was by any relevant journal literature), Dr Blum said that the mechanism of the plaintiff’s blackout was not “well known”.  
     88 There is considerable artificiality, and some irrelevance, in these arguments. Barwick CJ in Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey was dealing with a plaintiff who had witnessed the condition of a fellow employee after being severely burned by reason of electrocution. He said that it was reasonably foreseeable that negligence in relation to the misuse of the electrical equipment could cause severe burning to an employee, and that the sight of the burnt employee could mentally disturb another employee. The problem was that the particular mental disturbance which the plaintiff suffered was “a rare consequence or reaction”. Barwick CJ met that problem by holding that the rarity of the particular manifestation of mental disturbance did not prevent it being reasonably foreseeable. Mental disturbance was reasonably foreseeable, and the mental disturbance actually experienced was one member of the overall class of mental disturbances. The present case does not throw up that problem, and Barwick CJ’s solution of it is not material.  
     89 The observation of Windeyer J on which the defendant relied is irrelevant to the circumstances of the present plaintiff. She was not complaining of injury in the form of nervous shock or mental trauma. She was complaining of an injury not to her psyche but to her body. On the defendant’s argument, she experienced a psychological condition which was a causal mechanism of the physical injury which she unquestionably suffered and for which she was suing. She does not fall outside Glass JA’s test. The kind of damage she suffered (a broken neck) was reasonably foreseeable as a possible outcome of the kind of carelessness charged against the defendant. The likeliest mechanism by which that carelessness might cause her to break her neck was an instinctive movement away from the water, a slip during that movement, and a fall. The relevant mechanism by which the carelessness caused her broken neck was found by the trial judge to be different. If the defendant’s argument based on that mechanism being a “psychological shock” is to succeed, it must be on some principle other than that stated by Glass JA, unless the expression “kind” of damage includes the causal mechanism by which the damage is suffered. No authority was cited which suggests that this is so. 
     90 The defendant did cite Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] AC 837. That authority is against the defendant’s argument. In that case it was said to be reasonably foreseeable that a negligently unattended and unprotected paraffin lamp in a street could result in physical injury in the form of burning caused by the knocking over of the lamp and the igniting of the spilt oil by the flame of the lamp. The pursuer in that case did not suffer physical injury caused by burning in that particular way. Instead the lamp was knocked into a manhole, the paraffin vaporised, the resulting gas was ignited, an explosion took place, and the pursuer was burned in consequence. The House of Lords held that the latter kind of damage was unforeseeable, unlike the former, but was of the same kind, and the pursuer recovered. Lord Reid said at 847: “This accident was caused by a known source of danger, but caused in a way which could not have been foreseen, and, in my judgment, that affords no defence”. So here, the plaintiff’s accident was caused by a known form of danger; even if the causation of the accident could not have been foreseen, that does not prevent recovery. To the present case may also be applied the following observation of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest at 853, quoting Lord Mackintosh in Harvey v Singer Manufacturing Co Ltd 1960 SC 155 at 172:  
      
       
        
        “there was a duty owed by the defenders to safeguard the pursuer against the type or kind of occurrence which in fact happened and which resulted in his injuries, and the defenders are not absolved from liability because they did not envisage ‘the precise concatenation of circumstances which led up to the accident’.” 
        
       
     91 The defendant also referred to Kavanagh v Akhtar (1998) 45 NSWLR 588. The defendant criticised the use of the expression “direct response” at 601. However, nothing in the case, either as it stands or if corrected in the manner which the plaintiff desired, supports the defendant’s argument. Indeed, at 600 there are various passages in Mason P’s reasons for judgment adverse to the defendant’s case. One is: 
      
       
        
        “In  
        Chapman v Hearse 
         (1961) 106 CLR 112 at 120, the High Court approved the following passage from  
        Haynes v Harwood 
         [1935] 1 KB 146 at 156: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It is not necessary to show that this particular accident and this particular damage were probable; it is sufficient if the accident is of a class that might well be anticipated as one of the reasonable and probable results of the wrongful act’.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      A second passage is the following proposition derived from  
      Commonwealth v McLean 
       (1996) 41 NSWLR 389: 
       
       
        
        “A wrongdoer is responsible for all damage of the same type or kind as that which was reasonably foreseeable, even if the particular damage, or its extent, were not reasonably foreseeable, or the damage occurred in an unexpected or unforeseeable manner:  
        Commonwealth v McLean 
         (at 403E), citing  
        Chapman v Hearse 
         (1961) 106 CLR 112 at 120-121.” 
        
       
       
      A third passage is the quotation, as an illustration of that point, of the passage from Lord Reid’s speech in  
      Hughes v Lord Advocate 
       quoted above.  
       
     92 Another difficulty with the defendant’s argument is that even if the plaintiff did suffer a “psychological shock”, and that was an expression which Dr Conrad used on occasion (for example, at Black 38Q, 39B and 39K), there was no evidence that the “psychological shock” was “psychological injury”. Yet the plaintiff’s argument depended on a distinction between the “psychological injury” supposedly caused by the rise in temperature and the physical injury caused by the fall. If the events of 7 November 1996 had taken place, but the plaintiff had simply slid gently into the bath without suffering any bruising, any strain or any broken bone, there is no reason to suppose that she would have recovered damages: she would not have suffered injury. As noted earlier, on the basis of Dr Conrad’s evidence the trial judge found that the rise in water temperature experienced by the plaintiff “can cause a person to faint, especially a person such as the plaintiff who had low blood pressure”. The evidence of Dr Conrad was summarised thus by the trial judge: 
      
       
        
        “Dr Conrad described the mechanism of someone fainting. He said that a faint can be caused by a strong stimulus to nerves which acts on the vascular system dilating them and causing the person’s blood pressure to fall. This results in a lack of blood supply to the brain with the effect that the person temporarily loses consciousness. Dr Conrad said that that reaction can be set off by any sudden stimulus; by a loud noise or a sudden horrifying sight or a rapid change in temperature especially to those people predisposed to faint. In relation to predisposition to fainting, while Dr Conrad said that he did not know of any scientific studies on the question, his experience is that people who tend to faint tend to have lower blood pressure. In Dr Conrad’s view it was reasonable to say that a sudden rise of ten degrees in temperature would be an unpleasant stimulus and could cause someone to faint.” 
        
       
     93 Dr Conrad said that if the only condition from which the plaintiff suffered after the water temperature rose and she fell was the faint, he would have expected her to regain consciousness “within ninety seconds absolute maximum two minutes”. He did also say “a lot of these people are very dazed and frightened afterwards, they don’t understand what’s happened to them and may give the impression of being semi-conscious” (Black 43J-K). There was no evidence of any additional ill-effect, and so evanescent a condition is not injury.  
      
       
      The outcome on liability 
       
     94 It follows that all the challenges advanced by the defendant against the trial judge’s reasoning on liability fail. If the outcome – recovery by the plaintiff of damages in this case – were so irrational as to suggest some concealed error in the reasoning which led to it, it might be necessary, subject to the possible rights of the parties to be heard further, to give yet further consideration to that outcome, despite the care and scepticism with which the defendant approached the task of exposing potential flaws in the trial judge’s reasoning. However, though recovery by the plaintiff for a defect in so widely used a type of hot water system is at first sight surprising, on reflection it is less troubling. The precise problem affecting the plaintiff’s hot water system, namely a sudden and significant rise in temperature, may have been less acute in other houses. The reasonable foreseeability of injury which must be imputed to the defendant depends, on the reasoning set out above, on the two complaints the plaintiff and her husband made: whether a conclusion of reasonable foreseeability should be drawn in the absence of complaints of that type need not be and is not now decided.  
     95 Accordingly, though it may be true that this case goes near the borderline between liability and non-liability, there is no sufficient reason to think that it crosses over it. 
      
       
      General damages 
       
     96 The trial judge awarded the plaintiff $120,000 under the head of general damages.  
     97 The defendant submitted: 
      
       
        
        “The award of $120,000 for general damages was excessive; notwithstanding the serious injury that the plaintiff plainly suffered, and the ongoing consequences of some weakness in her arms, numbness in two fingers of her left hand, and some restrictions on her capacity to lift, it is to be noted that:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) she has returned to most of the activities of daily living (T84 line 55 to T85 line 55); 
        
       
       
        
        (b) her physical relationship with her husband was ‘not too bad’ at the time of trial (T60 line 35); 
        
       
       
        
        (c) by 27 January 1998, Dr McDowell (the treating neurosurgeon) (see Exhibit A) thought she was capable of ‘a resumption of normal activities’ and, by 3 February 1998 (see his 5 February 1998 report), she had got to a point of being capable of enjoying a vacation with almost no cervical pain – her neck ache was minimal and had not recently suffered headaches; that is, within about 13 months of the accident, notwithstanding the multiple surgery, and notwithstanding some ongoing disability, there was significant symptomatic and functional improvement. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour paid no attention to these important and relevant matters or, if he noticed them, gave them no sufficient weight and thereby fell into error. 
        
       
       
        
        Additionally, the award of general damages is disproportionate to the extent of the harm. The  
        Sharman v Evans 
         ((1977) 138 CLR 563) injunction of moderation has been ignored.” 
        
       
     98 Among the matters not mentioned in the submissions are the plaintiff’s consciousness of the fact that she had narrowly averted the risk of quadriplegia; her depression due to loss of mobility and inability to participate in sporting activities she had formerly enjoyed; stiffness in the plaintiff’s neck; scarring on the back of the plaintiff’s neck; constant neck pain during waking hours; pain in the left elbow; back soreness, albeit soreness which has improved; headaches; and two episodes of significant surgery. The plaintiff had experienced four years of pain and suffering by the time of trial, and was likely to live about another forty years. There was medical evidence that some of the forms of pain from which she suffered were likely to continue for the rest of her life. The trial judge accepted the genuineness of the plaintiff’s complaints.  
     99 In all the circumstances it cannot be said that the defendant has demonstrated that the general damages awarded are outside the range of a sound judgment. 
      
       
      Diminution in capacity to earn in future 
       
     100 The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
        “Mr Lidden of counsel on behalf of the plaintiff made a claim for future wage loss for the plaintiff for twenty-three years to age sixty-five at $300 per week discounted on the three percent tables and with fifteen percent for vicissitudes. According to Mr Lidden on that basis the plaintiff should be entitled to the sum of, in round terms, $220,000. I am not prepared to allow that sum and I do not consider that a weekly loss for twenty-three years of a dollar amount is an appropriate way to compensate the plaintiff for her loss of earning capacity for the following reasons. Firstly, she had before the accident, only a limited earning capacity because, amongst other things she had few marketable skills. She did not even have a School Certificate and she has not worked now for many years. There is no doubt that the earning capacity that she did have before her fall has been significantly reduced and it is clear on the medical reports that she is no longer fit for any form of manual work. However, she may have some residual earning capacity particularly if she undertakes some form of re-training. 
        
       
       
        
        I think it unrealistic to allow her $300 per week to age sixty-five because, in my view, with her limited employability and bearing in mind her age I doubt, even if she had not had her fall, whether she would have been in continuous employment from now until age sixty-five. I think the more reasonable basis to compensate her for her loss of earning capacity is to give her a sum which represents a buffer against her future loss of earning capacity and in this respect I allow the plaintiff $100,000.” 
        
       
     101 The defendant submitted that this passage contained errors.  
      
       
        
        “ … [the] essential errors are: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) there is no basis for adopting, for any purpose, the sum of $300 per week; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) there was evidence of the availability of any work for a woman with her low level of skill, and time out of the workforce; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) there was no basis for concluding that she would work to age 65, even if she could find work. 
        
       
       
        
        In short, notwithstanding the plaintiff proved a physical impairment, she failed to call evidence from which it could be established that any physical incapacity might sound in economic loss ( 
        Graham v Baker 
         (1961) 106 CLR 340). 
        
       
       
        
        The allowance of $100,000 as a global sum for future economic loss was grossly disproportionate to any loss of chance of income-earning activities by reason of her injuries and was plainly influenced by the plaintiff’s ambit claim based on unproved assumptions.” 
        
       
     102 It was common ground that the plaintiff intended to return to the workforce when her younger daughter went to high school in early 2000. It was also common ground that the plaintiff had worked enthusiastically between the ages of 15 and 22.  
     103 The defendant’s complaint about the selection of $300 per week is unconvincing. The trial judge was likely to be aware of general wage trends for persons with the limited qualifications of the plaintiff, and the defendant has not demonstrated that the figure of $300 per week lacks congruence with those trends.  
     104 So far as the defendant complained of a lack of evidence that work was available for a person in the position of the plaintiff, the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the plaintiff, a resident of Sydney, would have been capable of obtaining many types of work but for her injury – for example, as a cleaner, or as a retail sales assistant, or as a carer for children. He was entitled to conclude that there was some chance of full time work, and a better chance of part time work.  
     105 The defendant in oral argument referred to various medical problems which the plaintiff had before the accident. Among these problems were impetigo, dizziness, a “crook back”, menorragia, headaches, depression and low blood pressure. The defendant did not demonstrate that these problems were of such a type, or cropped up to such a degree or with such frequency, as to reduce to so low a level the chance of the plaintiff obtaining work after 2000 that the lump sum awarded was rendered appellably excessive.  
     106 The defendant’s suggestion that there was no basis for concluding that the plaintiff would seek to work until she was sixty-five ignores her evidence that she intended to go back to work in 2000, and also ignores the lack of any temporal qualification on that activity.  
     107 The defendant’s complaint about the award of $100,000 for diminution in capacity to earn in future is rejected. 
      
       
      Past and future care 
       
     108 The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
        “The plaintiff claims, amongst other things, for domestic assistance according to the principles in  
        Griffiths v Kerkemeyer 
        . She said that after her second surgery, her husband and her children were doing all the housework. She said that they now do the things which she used to do. She said that they make their own beds, do the vacuuming, bring the washing in, that her husband makes their own bed and that if her shoulders were aching too much that her husband would vacuum and mop and mow the lawns, all of which things she used to do. She said that she used to do the shopping before her fall but now can do so only on a reduced basis. She says that sometimes she will carry bags that are not too heavy, sometimes her husband brings the shopping bags in. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Watkins gave evidence that for the first six months after her fall and operation the plaintiff could do nothing for herself and that he bathed her and dressed her, that he also made all the meals and assisted the plaintiff in eating her meals. During that period he said that he spent about two hours per day helping the plaintiff with her personal tasks such as bathing and dressing and, in addition, did the washing, the housework for about four to seven hours per day. He said he thought he initially was spending between ten and twelve hours per day in either assisting the plaintiff directly, or attending to duties in the home that she would have normally performed herself. Mr Watkins said that he was a tow truck driver and managed a vehicle repair shop. He said initially he took holidays to help the plaintiff but was unable to return to work because he could not leave two children effectively unattended and resigned his job. He is now in receipt of a carer’s pension to look after the plaintiff. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Watkins said that the plaintiff has had some recovery in terms of being able to do things around the house and that she mostly washes, dresses and feeds herself. He says that he still helps her to an extent with dressing. He said that his role in the housework has continued and that he prepares the meals, does the shopping, the washing, the gardening and takes the children to school. He estimates that he does between four to six hours a day of this kind of work and has not returned to work since the accident. 
        
       
       
        
        There was some cross-examination of Mr Watkins about those matters but not very much. He was cross-examined on how often he takes the children to school and it appeared to me that there was some overlapping in the accounts that the plaintiff gave about taking the children to school and the account that Mr Watkins gave. In that respect, while I thought that Mr Watkins was an honest witness, I think that he may be inaccurate to a degree in that it appears to me on the little evidence I have that he may have slightly overstated the amount of assistance he gives the plaintiff and the amount of work he does in the house. However, on any view it is clear that he does a significant amount.” 
        
       
     109 Later he said: 
      
       
        
        “In terms of item seven past domestic assistance the plaintiff has claimed firstly for twenty-six weeks, that is to say the six months after her accident, eight hours per day, seven days per week at $15 per hour, a sum of $21,840. Mr Barko of counsel for the defendant very realistically did not dispute the reasonableness of $15 per hour and I allow that sum of $21,840. 
        
       
       
        
        In terms of the second part of item seven the period between six months after the plaintiff’s fall and today, there has been a claim for four hours per day for seven days a week at that same rate, $15 per hour. Because I believe that Mr Watkins has slightly overstated the amount of assistance he renders, I think it reasonable to allow three hours per day for seven days per week at $15 per hour for three point three years, that is to say $54,054 giving a sub-total of $75,894 for domestic assistance from the date of the fall to date. 
        
       
       
        
        Item eight is an allowance for future domestic assistance. In that respect I note that on the life tables the plaintiff has a life expectancy of forty years. I think it reasonable to allow three hours per day for seven days per week for forty years discounted on the three percent tables and reduced by fifteen percent for vicissitudes. There are varying factors in the future which may increase that amount and which may decrease it which I have done my best to take into account. The fact that the plaintiff’s children will eventually leave home and leave less housework to be done is one factor which might decrease that figure, however, the fact that on the medical reports the plaintiff’s condition is likely to get worse may counteract that effect. Accordingly I allow for future domestic assistance $312,045.” 
        
       
     110 The defendant submitted: 
      
       
        
        “His Honour plainly misunderstood the evidence; the plaintiff’s husband spoke of ‘looking after (his) wife’ two hours a day ‘actually, personally, physically on my wife’ (T100 line 5) in the first six to seven months after the accident. 
        
       
       
        
        Some of that period of time (four or five weeks) involved two periods in hospital when no need is demonstrated by her circumstances, nor proved by her evidence or that of her husband. 
        
       
       
        
        South Western Sydney Area Health Service occupational therapy notes, 21 November 1996 (Exhibit A), demonstrate that at the time of discharge she was showering with assistance (not in need of total care for that activity) and was able to toilet independently. She was ambulatory. 
        
       
       
        
        No doctor, nor any occupational therapist, proved in the evidence a need for any activities of personal hygiene, dressing, or the like, as being needed by the plaintiff after discharge from hospital. 
        
       
       
        
        The care needed by the plaintiff, on the evidence, is restricted to a few weeks after each hospitalisation. 
        
       
       
        
        What her husband or daughters in fact did does not prove reasonable need. 
        
       
       
        
        With respect to services provided to her husband and her daughters: 
        
       
       
        
        (a)  
        Sullivan v Gordon 
         ((1999) 47 NSWLR 319) is wrong; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the loss compensated for by His Honour’s award above two hours a day for a few weeks after each period of hospitalisation is either: 
        
       
       
        
         (i) a consortium claim by the husband; 
        
       
       
        
         (ii) a third party relational claim by the daughters; 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) and neither of those claims is (and in respect of the children’s claim, never has been) permissible, and the characterisation of that loss as the plaintiff’s loss is neither self-evident nor logical. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The plaintiff’s evidence at T84 and 85 was either overlooked or misunderstood by His Honour; it denies both the need and the quantification by His Honour at 21 hours per week.” 
        
       
     111 It is to be noted that the submission that Sullivan v Gordon was wrong was only formal: the defendant did not seek leave to reargue its correctness.  
     112 On future economic loss, the defendant submitted: 
      
       
        
        “The submissions made immediately above are repeated; in addition, to allow 21 hours per week for approximately 40 years must proceed from a misunderstanding of the evidence referred to, or oversight of that evidence, and is insupportable without medical or para-medical evidence of the present or likely future need.” 
        
       
     113 The evidence to which the defendant referred at pages 84 and 85 of the transcript was evidence summarised by the defendant thus: 
      
       
        
        “She vacuums, dusts, sweeps, cleans the hand basin and toilet, does some gardening, sweeps the paths, drives the daughters to school, picks them up, takes her daughters shopping, and there is evidence from her husband that he sometimes assists with the shopping but by no means all the time.” 
        
       
       
      The defendant submitted that to allow three hours per day for seven days per week was far too high because the plaintiff had done after the accident substantially the things which she had done before the accident. The defendant submitted: 
       
       
        
        “One would at the very least reduce the figure allowed by two-thirds or by such other mechanism or proportion that your Honours as a matter of judgment come to.” 
        
       
     114 In fact the evidence of the plaintiff was much more qualified than the defendant submitted. She said that she could do “some forms” of housework “occasionally”. She said that she did “some gardening” when “I feel able to”.  
      
       
      The first six months 
     115 So far as the first six months after the accident are concerned, the figure of $21,840 may be too high to the extent that it includes periods in hospital. During those periods the bulk of the care was carried out by hospital staff. However, it is open to infer that the husband cared for the plaintiff to some extent while she was in hospital; that appears to be the modus operandi of modern public hospitals, and not only public hospitals.  
     116 The criticism advanced by the defendant of the trial judge that he misunderstood the husband’s evidence requires it to be set out. 
      
       
        
        “Q. In that total period which we’ve heard 6 or 7 months, I think, of that order, what, if anything, was she able to do for herself? 
        
       
       
        
        A. To start with next to nothing. 
         
         
        Q. Matters of personal hygiene -- 
         
         
        A. Personal hygiene, bathing. 
         
         
        Q. – such as bathing and so on. Who was doing those for her? 
         
         
        A. I was bathing her. I was dressing her, assisting with meals and doing all -- 
         
         
        Q. You mean assisting with helping her eat, you mean? 
         
         
        A. Well, I was making the meals and assisting to feed them to her. She’d have a little bit of difficulty there at first lifting her arms et cetera or holding things. Her grip was a bit weak in one of her hands. All the aspects of basic living. 
         
         
        Q. And over that 6 or 7 month period how many hours a day would you say you were spending looking after your wife? 
         
         
        A. Probably 2 hours a day actually, personally, physically on my wife. 
         
         
        Q. Before the accident – the household domestic activities, mopping, vacuuming, washing, cooking, all of those things, who did them? 
         
         
        A. My wife Vicki did them all. 
         
         
        Q. And in this 6 or 7 month period who was doing those things? 
         
         
        A. I was. 
         
         
        Q. Can you tell me how many hours a day that took as well as the two hours you spent actually on her? 
         
         
        A. At first when I didn’t know what I was doing it was probably taking me 10 or 12 hours a day but I got it down to 4 or 5 now. 
         
         
        Q. I’m dealing with this period 6 or 7 months after the accident, do you understand? 
         
         
        A. Between 4 to 7 hours daily. 
         
         
        Q. That’s on the ordinary household activities? 
         
         
        A. On the ordinary household chores.” 
        
       
       
      Beyond one clarificatory question, that evidence was not the subject of cross-examination.  
       
     117 The defendant’s submission appeared to be that allowance should only be made for assistance for two hours per day in the few weeks after each hospitalisation. The defendant estimated that as equating to about $5,000; alternatively it was prepared to allow two hours per day for thirty weeks at $15 per hour, which produced a figure of $6,300.  
     118 The defendant’s stress on the two hours per day spent by the husband “actually, personally, physically” looking after the plaintiff as the upper limit for recovery would lead to an unduly restricted outcome in several ways. 
     119 First, some of the household domestic activities carried out by the plaintiff before the accident and by her husband after it which were distinct from the two hours a day of personal care were carried out for the benefit of the daughters. Their food had to be prepared, their clothes washed, their parts of the house cleaned. Sullivan v Gordon decided that the cost of carrying out those activities was a legitimate head of damage. The defendant submitted that Sullivan v Gordon was factually distinguishable on the basis that there was no-one who could care for the plaintiff’s child in that case apart from the plaintiff, and the child was totally dependent on her. It is true that the facts were different, but the statements of principle cover the present facts.  
     120 Secondly, some of the household domestic activities carried out by the plaintiff before the accident and by the husband after it were carried out for the benefit of the husband. Sullivan v Gordon contains dicta to the effect that that too is a head of recoverable damage: see at [6] per Mason P.  
     121 Thirdly, some of the household domestic activities carried out by the plaintiff before the accident and by the husband after it were carried out for the benefit of the plaintiff herself. The cost of that must be a recoverable head of damage.  
     122 Fourthly, three judges in the High Court which decided Van Gervan v Fenton (1992) 175 CLR 327, namely Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ, stated two relevant propositions. The first was that where domestic services were undertaken, as part of mutual give-and-take by person in a marital relationship, they cannot be converted into additional services necessary to attend to the accident-caused needs of an injured plaintiff in circumstances where they would have been performed in the same way and to the same extent in any event. The second proposition was that those services would be taken out of the area of the ordinary give-and-take to the extent that the injuries to the injured plaintiff precluded him or her from providing any countervailing services; to that extent, the continuing gratuitous services provided by the other person should be treated as additional services which have been or will be provided by him or her to look after the accident-caused needs of the plaintiff. The first proposition might well exclude recovery for certain of “the ordinary household chores”, as the plaintiff’s husband described them. The second proposition appears to negate that outcome so far as matters like gardening are concerned to the extent that the plaintiff can no longer provide countervailing services.  
     123 In all the circumstances there appears to be no justification for reducing the $21,840, except possibly in relation to the periods while the plaintiff was in hospital. However, a reduction to allow for the no doubt lower level of services provided by the husband while the plaintiff was in hospital would be tinkering in view of the fact that the husband probably provided some services to the plaintiff in hospital and had to provide services for himself and the children in any event at these times. Hence no reduction should be made. 
      
       
      May 1997 to trial 
     124 The defendant submitted that the mere fact that services were provided by the husband did not establish that the plaintiff had a need for them. Again, the evidence of the plaintiff and of some of the doctors supports the conclusion that there was in truth a need. The husband’s evidence on this point was: 
      
       
        
        “Q. So from that time to the present time she’s taken over matters of personal care such as washing herself and feeding herself and dressing herself and things of that nature, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Not 100 per cent. 
         
         
        Q. What do you have to help with? 
         
         
        A. Well, I still have – she has difficulty with some clothing -- 
         
         
        Q. With buttons and things like that? 
         
         
        A. Yes and sometimes pulling different garments over her head and taking them off. 
         
         
        Q. Putting it to one side for a moment that limited assistance that you provide, she’s otherwise independent of personal care, isn’t she? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. But your role in doing housework, has that continued? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Right up to date? 
         
         
        A. Right up to date. 
         
         
        Q. What sort of things do you do nowadays? 
         
         
        A. Meal preparation, washing, ironing, cleaning, garden chores, shopping, children to school. 
         
         
        Q. How many hours a day would you say nowadays you’re doing on these sorts of household tasks? 
         
         
        A. Four to six maybe. 
         
         
        Q. Four to six what? 
         
         
        A. Hours.” 
        
       
       
      There was no cross-examination on that evidence. 
       
     125 The trial judge reduced the husband’s figure of four-six hours to three hours for the sound reasons he gave. The defendant contended that the reduction should have been much greater. For at least part of the relevant period there are reasons for thinking that even three hours may be a little high, but as explained below it is simpler to make an adjustment to the figure for the period after the trial than to seek to adjust this figure. Apart from those matters to be referred to below, the figure selected does not appear so wrong as to justify interference with it by this Court. 
      
       
      After the trial 
     126 Here again the trial judge selected three hours. The defendant contended in effect that the correct figure should have been one hour, on the assumption that all its other submissions were rejected. The trial judge’s approach in this area appears more vulnerable than in the earlier two. Though the plaintiff’s condition was expected to worsen in some ways, the fact is that it had actually improved in others (for example, back soreness) and was expected to improve in yet others (for example, improvement in neck function). Further, daughters aged between 11 and 8 in 1996 would be likely to tend to create increasing amounts of housework until they reached the age of about 17, at which point even if they continued to live with their parents, they would tend to make less mess and to spend less time at home. Further, the difference between what the plaintiff said she did in terms of driving the children to school (apparently routinely) and what the husband said she did (not very often) suggests that her need is less great than he perceived it to be, and that by the time of the trial there had been a significant improvement in her condition. Similarly, though the plaintiff had been advised to limit her neck movements while shopping, she is in fact capable of shopping to some significant degree. Those signs of improvement cast a doubt over the trial judge’s reasoning not only for the period after the trial, but also for at least part of the period from May 1997 up to the trial. However, it seems simpler, given the indeterminacy of the exercise, to allow for the difficulty by leaving the figure for the May 1997-trial period untouched, while reducing the figure for the post trial period.  
     127 An appropriate course is to reduce the trial judge’s figure for the post trial period by one-third. That makes it $208,030 instead of $312,045. That in turn produces a verdict of $532,908.  
      
       
      Orders 
       
     128 On the above reasoning, the defendant has enjoyed success to a significant degree in gross dollar terms, though the success is less in percentage terms. However, the bulk of the written and oral arguments were devoted to issues of liability on which the defendant failed, and the defendant also failed on all quantum questions except one. In the circumstances the defendant should pay half the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal. 
     129 The orders proposed are as follow: 
      
       
      1. The appeal is allowed. 
       
       
      2. The verdict of the trial judge is set aside. 
       
       
      3. In lieu of the verdict of the trial judge, there will be a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $532,908 with judgment accordingly with effect from 13 September 2000. 
       
       
      4. The defendant is to pay half of the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal. 
       
       
      5. It is noted that the costs order made by the trial judge will stand.

    70032/01 - REGINA v Jeffrey William Spencer ROSE 
     
      
    JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
     
      
    1 KIRBY J: On 16 November 2001, a jury found Mr Jeffrey Rose guilty of the murder of his wife, Kristine Anne Rose. It remains for me to now pass sentence. In order to do so, I must determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion in a manner consistent with the jury verdict (Savaas v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 1). Where facts are adverse they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Rose, it is enough that they should be proved on the balance of probabilities (R v Storey (1997) 89 A Crim R 519; Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270). 
     
      
       
      The Relationship Between Mr Rose and the Deceased 
      
    2 Mr Rose was born on 9 January 1945. His wife, Kristine, was born on 31 October 1950. They married at Coffs Harbour in November 1977. The deceased was last seen on Friday 30 April 1982. Her body was discovered in a remote location approximately six kilometres from Armidale on 23 May 1982. At the time of these events, therefore, the deceased was 31 years old. Mr Rose was 37. Mr Rose is now aged 57 years. 
     
      
    3 There was a good deal of evidence at the trial concerning the relationship between Mr Rose and his wife, including evidence from Mr Rose. The Crown suggested that this evidence demonstrated a history of physical abuse before the murder. According to the Crown, it was, therefore, a circumstance of aggravation.  
     
      
    4 There certainly was evidence, which I accept, that Mr Rose was possessive. He was someone who sought to exert control over his wife. I also accept that Mr Rose abused alcohol and that, when affected by alcohol, he could be verbally abusive. 
     
      
    5 However, I am not able to accept beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Rose physically abused his wife. Indeed, I think it likely that he did not do so in any significant way. For more than two years before January 1982, Mr Rose and the deceased lived in a caravan on a property owned by Deirdre and John Allison. Mr and Mrs Allison were friends. They saw Mr Rose and his wife every day, or every other day. Yet neither Mr Allison nor Mrs Allison ever witnessed Mr Rose striking his wife. Nor did they see bruises or other signs of violence. More than that, the deceased never complained to either of them of having been beaten by Mr Rose. 
     
      
    6 I accept this evidence, although it does not provide a complete answer to the Crown assertion. The relationship between Mr Rose and his wife came under greatest strain after they left the Allisons and moved to Armidale in January 1982. In February 1982 they separated. Mr Rose was plainly unhappy about his wife’s decision to enrol at the University of New England. The deceased, for a short time, entered a women’s shelter in Armidale. Another person at the shelter was Ms Rhonda Craig. Ms Craig gave evidence of repeated complaints by the deceased of physical abuse. She also said that she repeatedly saw physical injuries, including, bruises, black eyes, split lips and so on. No-one else gave evidence of having seen such injuries, though a number of witnesses had seen the deceased during the months following her arrival in Armidale. I think it likely, for this and other reasons, that Ms Craig has confused the deceased with someone else at the women’s shelter. 
     
      
    7 Having been at the women’s shelter for about one week, the deceased moved to the home of a friend, Ms Julie Wragg. She remained with Ms Wragg for about three weeks before moving to a flat provided by the university. Ms Wragg met Mr Rose. During the time that the deceased was living with her, she did not witness any physical violence by Mr Rose towards his wife. Nor did she give evidence of injuries. She did, however, give evidence of complaints by Kristine Rose of having been physically abused. Such evidence, in its detail, was not included in her original statement. The terms of her account suggested that such abuse must have occurred during the time that the deceased was living with the Allisons. Such evidence, therefore, was at odds with the evidence given by Mr and Mrs Allison, whose evidence I prefer. 
     
      
    8 The only other evidence of physical abuse was that of a university friend, Ms Joanne Fuller. Ms Fuller was an impressive witness. She gave evidence that the deceased complained that her husband had physically thrown her out of the caravan on one occasion. Ms Fuller acknowledged that she did not include that assertion in her original statement. Even if it were right, it was evidence of an isolated incident without the suggestion of injury. 
     
      
       
      The Circumstances of Kristine Rose’s Death 
      
    9 Let me move to the circumstances of the death of Kristine Rose. Mr Stratton, counsel for Mr Rose, urged that I should not find an intention to kill, as opposed to an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    10 Mr Rose, in his youth, had practiced karate for a number of years. He attained the level of brown belt, which is one level below black belt, being the highest level that can be achieved (apart from an instructor qualification). Students of karate are taught to apply pressure to various susceptible points of the body, including the neck. They are also taught that excessive pressure may cause death. I am satisfied that Mr Rose had this knowledge. 
     
      
    11 Three witnesses gave evidence that, before the murder, Mr Rose, whilst under the influence of alcohol, boasted that he was familiar with karate, and knew how to kill someone. Two of these witnesses also said that Mr Rose made threats against his wife, Kristine. Each came forward many years after Kristine Rose’s death. Their evidence, therefore, must be approached with considerable caution (Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79). In the case of Ms Anne-Marie Reeves and her sister, Ms Michelle Long, there were significant contradictions and discrepancies in the accounts which they gave. Ms Dianna Bourke, the other witness, gave evidence in a straight forward way. I am satisfied that, under the influence of alcohol, Mr Rose did speak of his knowledge of karate and pressure points. I accept the evidence of Ms Bourke that he gestured with his fingers towards his neck. I am, however, not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Rose specifically threatened his wife. Nonetheless, clearly Mr Rose, before the murder, was turning over in his mind the possibility of harm to the deceased. 
     
      
    12 Some weeks before 30 April 1982, Kristine Rose met a person I shall refer to as “Peter”, the brother of a friend from the University. The meeting took place during the Easter weekend of 1982. She was clearly attracted to him, as he was to her. They had intercourse a number of times during the course of that weekend. Peter then returned to Brisbane on 11 April 1982. He thereafter sent a card to the deceased, expressing his affection. The card came to the notice of Mr Rose. Mr Rose, at this time, still loved his wife. He hoped that they would sort out their differences and reunite. They had three children. Mr Rose was naturally upset by the card. 
     
      
    13 In the weeks that followed, Mr Rose and the deceased continued to speak and occasionally see each other. Lectures finished and term ended on Friday 30 April 1982. The deceased made plans to travel to Brisbane by bus at 11.00 pm that evening in order to stay with Peter. She was plainly excited by the prospect. She arranged to meet her university friends at the hotel in Armidale some hours before the bus left. 
     
      
    14 The deceased also made arrangements with Mr Rose to have dinner with him that evening before she went to the hotel. He had agreed to look after her pet bird and her pot plants. She, in turn, had undertaken to leave him her car. Mr Rose, at that time, was disqualified from driving. He planned to use his wife’s car the following Monday when undertaking a driving test. 
     
      
    15 Precisely how the deceased met her death cannot be known with certainty. One infers that something occurred during the course of their meeting which excited Mr Rose’s anger. When her body was discovered more than three weeks later, the only injury found on autopsy was a small bruise in the area of the neck, near the carotid sinus. The jury obviously accepted, and I accept, that Mr Rose deliberately applied pressure to his wife’s neck, and thereby caused her death. Given his knowledge of martial arts, I am satisfied that he did so, intending to kill her. I believe it is likely that the intention was spontaneously formed. In no sense do I believe that he lured her into a trap, intending to cause her harm. Rather, I think it likely that her evident happiness at the prospect of rejoining Peter was more than he could bear. 
     
      
    16 Having murdered his wife, Mr Rose disposed of her body. He told friends, and then the police, a false story. He adhered to that story before the jury. He did not give evidence on sentence. However, a psychiatric report was tendered on his behalf. It included a history in which Mr Rose again asserted his innocence. Plainly there is no contrition. 
     
      
    17 Murder has always been regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstances, it calls for a substantial sentence by way of imprisonment to serve the interests of punishment, including general deterrence. I have been furnished with Victim Impact Statements by two of the children of the deceased, and by her sister. Each describes the anguish occasioned by her death, including the circumstances of her death. That anguish has been made the worse by the protracted nature of the prosecution, although it should be said that Mr Rose was in no way responsible for that delay. One can only sympathise with members of the family and imagine their agony. However, the sorrow of those who remain behind is not a matter which I should take into account, and I do not do so (R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85). 
     
      
       
      The Subjective Circumstances of Mr Rose 
      
    18 Mr Rose had a difficult early life. He was one of six children. His father deserted the family and shortly after died. His mother brought up the children alone, working to support them. 
     
      
    19 Mr Rose has a number of criminal convictions. They are for offences of dishonesty, not violence. In 1962 he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for a series of offences involving breaking and entering. In 1964 he was again sentenced to imprisonment, on this occasion for one month, for offences of dishonesty. He has other minor convictions of no particular relevance. His last conviction was in 1977. 
     
      
    20 Three issues arise which have been the subject of submissions:· First, is Mr Rose’s age a relevant consideration?· Secondly, is the delay in bringing the prosecution a relevant matter, suggesting the need for leniency?· Thirdly, what are the prospects of rehabilitation? Does Mr Rose, upon release, present a danger to the community, and particularly women? 
     
      
    21 There is also an issue as to whether a finding should be made of special circumstances, justifying a departure from the ratio between non-parole period and the term of the sentence. 
     
      
    22 I will deal with each issue in turn. 
     
      
       
      The Age of Mr Rose 
      
    23 Mr Rose, as mentioned, is 57 years old. Inevitably, the sentence must include a significant non-parole period. Mr Rose, therefore, is likely to be quite old upon release. 
     
      
    24 It was common ground that, in determining an appropriate sentence, I should have regard to Mr Rose’s age. Authorities suggest that it is relevant in at least three ways (Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502). First, it must be acknowledged that gaol involves the risk of physical assault from other prisoners. Should it happen that Mr Rose is threatened by other prisoners, his advanced age may put him at a disadvantage. Indeed, because Mr Rose has a withered right arm, that disadvantage is likely to be the greater. Gaol, therefore, is likely to be more onerous for him than for other younger and able bodied prisoners. 
     
      
    25 Secondly, a lengthy sentence upon a person of advanced years is likely to be the more onerous for the reasons explained by Allen J (with whom Handley JA and Hulme J agreed) in Holyoak: (at 507) 
     
      
       
        
        “It is, of course, clear that a sentence imposed upon an offender when he (is) of such an age that, should he not die in gaol, he will have little worthwhile life left after his release is likely to bear more heavily upon the offender than a similar term imposed upon a younger man who can look forward to a worthwhile life after release. This is so obvious that I would not infer that his Honour did not recognise it.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour added: (at 507) 
     
      
       
        
        “Of course, account must be taken of how much more onerous it will be for him to serve a gaol sentence than it would be if he were younger. That is material to the appropriate length of the full-time custody.” 
        
       
      
    27 Thirdly, the advanced age of an offender is also relevant to the suitability of the case as a vehicle for general deterrence (Holyoak: Allen J at 507). 
     
      
       
      The Delay in Prosecution 
      
    28 The crime for which Mr Rose has been convicted was committed on or about 30 April 1982. The prosecution of Mr Rose was contemplated at that time. Indeed, it was recommended by the Coroner. However, the Attorney General declined to file a bill. Interest in the prosecution was revived in 1995. It is likely that Mr Rose became aware of that interest in approximately 1997, when witnesses were approached by the police. Mr Rose was charged in June 2000. He was, as mentioned, convicted on 16 November 2001.  
     
      
    29 Delay in prosecution does not give rise to an automatic right to leniency. Leniency will be appropriate either where the crime may be described as “stale”, or where the offender can point to a specific detriment, the consequence of delay. A crime may be described as stale where it can be characterised as being less serious and where there has been significant delay. Murder can never be described as stale, although its prosecution may amount to an abuse of process where the delay is extraordinary. That is not this case, although there was significant delay. 
     
      
    30 Detriment may arise in many ways. Evidence relevant on sentence, which may have been available had the prosecution been brought in a timely way, may cease to be available (Regina v V (CCA, 24.2.98, unreported). The offender, on the other hand, may have been left in a state of uncertain suspense (R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517, per Street CJ at 519), or may have altered his life in ways which make the punishment more onerous once imposed. Or there may be specific detriment which may arise in other ways. Allen J, in Holyoak, said this: (at 508) 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether, in any particular case, so long a delay is a detriment depends upon the circumstances of that case. There is no rule of law that it always is a detriment - although often it will be. It could be, to take a case at one extreme, that the offender has spent years in emotional hell, appalled at what he has done, terrified that the day may come when he is found out, disgraced and convicted, fearing that at any time there will be that knock on the door and never feeling free to remain so long in any community that he comes to be known and his background be of interest to others. At the other extreme the offender may have gone through the years untroubled by his offences, lacking any remorse in respect of them and feeling confident that they will never come to light because the victim never would be prepared to talk about them, his confidence increasing as the years went by with his victim remaining silent - the offender enjoying over the many years unwarranted acceptance by his associates in his respectable and stable lifestyle.” 
        
       
      
    31 On the other hand, delay may work to the offender’s advantage. As Wood J said in R v V (supra), delay may provide “an opportunity ... for the offender to establish a new life and to positively demonstrate his rehabilitation”. 
     
      
    32 Here there was no evidence that, at least before 1997, Mr Rose lived in a state of uncertain suspense, or suffered some private hell. Before 1997 he regarded the matter as behind him. Once revived, there was some delay before charges were laid. No doubt some anguish was associated with that delay. There was, I believe, disadvantage to Mr Rose in that he may have had available evidence on sentence rebutting the allegation of domestic violence had the prosecution been brought in a timely way. Notwithstanding that disadvantage, I have found in his favour on that issue and the detriment therefore has no particular relevance. 
     
      
    33 The delay, indeed, has operated to Mr Rose’s advantage in one respect. He is now able to point to a trouble free life over the last twenty years, which is relevant to the issue of Mr Rose’s rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      Rehabilitation of Mr Rose 
      
    34 Dealing with the issue of rehabilitation, a psychiatric report of Dr Jennifer Thompson, dated 17 December 2001, was tendered on behalf of Mr Rose. Dr Thompson offered the view that there was little risk of Mr Rose reoffending. I accept that view. Dr Thompson’s opinion was, in part, based upon the absence of any offence in the period since 1982. 
     
      
       
      Special Circumstances 
      
    35 There is no doubt that Mr Rose’s period of incarceration is likely to be difficult, first because of his age, and secondly because of his right arm disability, which is significant. Further, his sentence will be served in New South Wales whereas his friends, and especially his son Damien, are located in Victoria. These matters in combination may give rise to difficulties of adjustment on release, although I remain confidence, as I have said, that Mr Rose will not reoffend. I believe, nonetheless, that a finding of special circumstances is justified (s44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999), although the adjustment required to Mr Rose’s sentence is not substantial because, necessarily, the non parole period must itself be significant. 
     
      
    36 Mr Rose was in custody from 15 June 2000 until 19 October 2000, when he was released on bail. He was again placed in custody on 16 November 2001, when the jury returned its verdict. On my calculations, he has spent a total of a little less than five months in custody before his conviction on 16 November 2001. 
     
      
    37 The sentence which seems to me appropriate in the circumstances is 14 years, with a non-parole period of 10 years. In framing the sentence, which I will now impose, I have subtracted five months from both the term of imprisonment and the non-parole period. I have identified as the date of commencement, the date on which Mr Rose returned to custody, having been convicted, namely 16 November 2001. 
     
      
    38 Jeffrey William Spencer Rose, I sentence you to imprisonment for 13 years and 7 months commencing on 16 November 2001 with a non-parole period of 9 years and 7 months . You will be eligible for release on parole on 15 June 2011. Your sentence will expire on 15 June 2015.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESEQUITY DIVISIONAUSTIN JTHURSDAY 28 FEBRUARY 20024605/99 PHYLLIS YARED V GLENHURST GARDENS PTY LTD 
     
      
    JUDGMENT (revised 28 February 2002 to correct typographical errors) 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This case has arisen in consequence of the partial collapse of a high retaining wall at the rear of the plaintiff's property at 56 New Beach Road, Darling Point. The property comprises a substantial principal residence and (until the happening of the events I shall describe) a self-contained cottage in the backyard, between the main house and the retaining wall. The back (eastern) wall of the cottage was located about half to one and a half metres to the west of the retaining wall. 
     
      
    2 The plaintiff took up residence in the main house in 1967, and has lived there since that time, at first with her husband and then alone, after his death in November 1985. Until August 1998 she derived income from renting the ground floor of the principal residence, and also renting the cottage.  
     
      
    3 The defendant is the owner of the property to the rear of the plaintiff's property, 11 Yarranabbe Road, Darling Point, and has owned the property since 1958. There is a large residential home unit building on the defendant's property, though the building is well away from the boundary with the plaintiff's land.  
     
      
    4 The plaintiff's property faces east on to New Beach Road. The eastern boundary at the rear of the plaintiff's property, where the retaining wall is located, is a common boundary with the defendant's property. The common boundary runs approximately in a north/south direction. The surface level of the defendant's property adjoining the common boundary slopes from north to south, some 4 to 7 metres above the surface level of plaintiff's property. 
     
      
    5 It appears (in view of the evidence of Dr John Cooke, an architect who inspected the property in August 2000) that the retaining wall was constructed in 1927, at about the same time as the construction of the principal dwelling on the plaintiff's land. The retaining wall gave lateral support to a high embankment, at about the common boundary line. It was constructed according to the methods and standards in use in 1927. The wall was approximately 600 mm thick its base and 230 mm thick at the top, apparently without any buttressing except at the southern end. A lime-based mortar was used. Evidence given by one of the defendant's experts indicated that this kind of mortar increases in strength over time, but on the other hand the weathering of the exposed portion of the wall would have led to a loss of mortar.  
     
      
    6 The defendant says that the retaining wall was wholly on the plaintiff's land, but the plaintiff disagrees. A survey report by Charmers & Finney dated 30 May 1927 appears to show a ""brick wall on rock foundation"" on the rear boundary of the property. A report by Ed Palaitis & Associates dated 25 August 1998, while noting that the boundaries are difficult to determine and that a registered strata plan relating to the property to the north appears to dispute the northern boundary, states that the remains of the retaining wall at the northern end of the rear boundary of the property indicate that the boundary is the centre of the wall. It is probable, in my view, that the boundary ran through the wall. A contrary survey was tendered by the defendant but ruled to be inadmissible. 
     
      
    7 The plaintiff's backyard is on two levels. The lower level, the area closer to the house, has been paved. Until the collapse of the wall, the upper level was reached by climbing over a stone wall about 1.5 metres above the paved area, to a passageway between the cottage and the brick wall. The passageway varied in width from approximately 50 centimetres to about 1.5 metres. 
     
      
    8 Before its collapse, the retaining wall had nine or 10 weep holes at its base and at a level approximately three bricks above the ground. The weep holes were in a single line. Each weep hole was the height of a brick and approximately a mortar space in width. 
     
      
    9 The defendant's expert evidence is to the effect that the wall had a design life of no more than 70 years. In my opinion, the design life of the wall has no legal significance in this case, however useful the concept may be for engineers. A duty not to cause the failure of a wall with a design life of 50 years does not exist for years 1 to 50 and terminate at the end of the 50th year. A duty not to cause its failure will endure so long as the wall stands, even if the wall is still standing after 100 years.  
     
      
    10 During the period from about November 1960 to March 1961 the defendant erected a concrete platform for a car parking area on part of its land, which extended not far from the common boundary with the plaintiff's property, but at the top of the embankment and therefore at a much higher level than the plaintiff's property. Plans for the car park were approved by Woollahra Council on 29 November 1960. In connection with the erection of the car park, the defendant deposited some fill material on its land above and behind the retaining wall, so as to support the southern end of the car park. The expert witnesses of the parties generally agree that the erection of the car park did not increase the flow of stormwater onto the land between the car park in the retaining wall, and if anything, the car park reduced the flow of water by directing water from the car park slab and roof to the defendant's property away from the retaining wall. 
     
      
    11 In November 1960, and progressively thereafter, the defendant permitted trees, shrubs and other vegetation to grow in the area above the retaining wall and where the fill material had been deposited, which may have contributed to retaining soil (including the fill material). During the period from approximately 1980 until August 1998 the defendant removed some trees and other vegetation. There is controversy between the parties as to what was done, and whether the risk of subsidence of the fill material and retaining wall was thereby increased. 
     
      
    The collapse of the retaining wall 
     
      
    12 From time to time in Sydney there are periods of very heavy rainfall. For example, in August 1986 approximately 290 mm of rain fell in the eastern suburbs of Sydney over a period of 24 hours. There was a similar storm event on 6 and 7 August 1998. At Observatory Hill approximately 227.8 mm of rain fell between 9 am and 5 pm on 7 August. There is evidence of a substantial number of landslides and the collapse of retaining walls in the Sydney area on that day. On that day the retaining wall partly collapsed, depositing a large quantity of bricks, soil, vegetation and debris on the plaintiff's land. The collapse damaged the cottage at the rear of the main house. 
     
      
    13 Photographs taken after the collapse (for example, those annexed to the affidavit of Steven Lewis, the plaintiff's solicitor, sworn on 8 November 1999) indicate that large portions of the retaining wall and the soil behind it fell onto the plaintiff's property. What was left standing was a small portion of the retaining wall at the northern end, attached to the wall which ran along the northern boundary, and also a part of the retaining wall a few metres high and a few metres long at roughly the middle or a little to the south of the middle of the eastern boundary (""the centre segment""). It appears that the centre segment wholly moved forward a small distance, laterally, off the stone shelf on which it had stood and onto the plaintiff's land, and the top part of the wall along the centre segment broke off and fell, but the rest remained standing. Mr D W Knox, a consulting engineer who inspected the property for loss assessors on 10 August 1998, estimated that the retaining wall shifted laterally towards the house by about 500 mm at the northern end about 2000 to 2500 mm at the southern end. Part of the wall and the soil behind it collapsed on to the roof of the cottage, demolishing part of the roof and damaging the walls at the eastern end of the cottage. The collapse of the wall and the subsidence left an exposed face of rock and soil along the defendant's land, highest at the northern end and falling away to the south. 
     
      
    14 A pine tree and a smaller tree fell over the centre segment of the wall and onto the roof of the cottage, though some of their roots remained in the soil on the defendant's land a little behind the centre segment. On the basis of visual observation by means of the photographs, it seems to me unlikely that either of the trees contributed to the collapse of the wall. Neither of the trees is large - the diameter of the trunk of the pine tree, at its thickest point, appears to the about the length of a single brick, and the other tree is much smaller. 
     
      
    15 Photographs in evidence, taken on 10 August 1998, show that the cottage had moved, causing its support columns to crack and tilt. Following the collapse of the wall, the plaintiff's property was inspected by the State Emergency Service, who advised the plaintiff that the house, including the downstairs flat, and the cottage, could not be occupied due to the potential danger of further subsidence. The cottage was demolished down to the first floor level in late August 1998, after discussions between the plaintiff and her insurer, AAMI. This was after the property had been inspected for the loss assessors by Mr Knox, who wrote a report for them dated 21 August 1998.  
     
      
    16 Mr Fernando Barros of F & L Building Consultants Pty Ltd, a structural engineer, wrote a report dated 20 March 2001 after several site inspections over the previous weeks, noting that the ground floor walls, which remained standing after demolition of the upper floor, were cracked and some of them were out of plane, and that the timber flooring and framing of the upper floor had been exposed to the elements and had become distorted due to the wall movements. He advised that it would not be feasible to repair the existing ground floor walls and upper flooring, and that the complete rebuilding of the dwelling would be a more feasible and cost-effective alternative. This conclusion conflicted with the opinion expressed by Mr Rick Pilz, a principal structural engineer at Gutteridge Haskins & Davey Pty Ltd, who issued a structural report to the defendant's solicitors on 22 June 2001. Mr Pilz said that the ground slab and full brick walls of the cottage were in reasonable condition and could be incorporated into the rebuilding of the extension, but the upper storey of the cottage had deteriorated through being left open to the weather in the period since collapse of the wall and would require replacement.  
     
      
    17 In approximately mid-September 1998 the house and downstairs flat were reoccupied. The tenant of the cottage took up occupation of the downstairs flat. At the time of the collapse of the wall, the downstairs flat was unoccupied but a lease had been signed. The proposed lessees were unable to take up occupation.  
     
      
    18 On 29 October 1998 Woollahra Municipal Council issued a Notice of Proposed Order pursuant to Order 4 of the Table to s 121 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), directed to the plaintiff. The terms of the proposed order were ""to repair or replace the collapsed retaining wall on the boundary adjoining 11 Yarranabbe Road Darling Point"". The reason for the proposed order was stated to be that ""the retaining wall has collapsed and is a danger to the public"". The time for compliance with the proposed order was to be 90 days from the date of the order. The plaintiff was invited to make representations before the order was made. 
     
      
    19 The plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the Council on 9 February 1999, replying to the Council's notice of proposed order. They asserted that the defendant was liable to stabilise the soil on its property and make good the retaining wall. They said that since the defendant had denied liability, their client was faced with commencing a proceeding in this Court for an injunction to require the defendant to take reasonable steps to prevent damage to her property. They asked the Council to inform them whether it proposed to take any further action against the plaintiff in respect of the notice. The plaintiff's solicitors have received no reply from the Council, and the Council has not made an order under s 121 of the Act. 
     
      
    20 Although there has been some cleaning up on the site, the retaining wall has not been repaired. There is some rather unedifying correspondence in evidence between the solicitors for the parties, demonstrating failure on both sides to extend that degree of trust, co-operation and common sense that would have led to agreement as to the appropriate remedial work. Essentially, both parties proceeded on the basis that brick rubble and dirt needed to be removed before the engineers could recommend an appropriate new retaining wall or other structure, and that the plaintiff would pay for removal of the brick rubble while the defendant would pay for removal of the dirt that had fallen from its to the plaintiff's land. But they could not agree to use a single contractor nor as to the proper sequence of the removal of bricks and dirt. 
     
      
    21 After several months the parties did agree to a joint site meeting of lawyers and engineers, which took place on 29 June 1999. Then the engineers met with contractors on the site on 6 July 1999. The engineers in attendance were Dr Felix Barda of Alba Associates, a structural engineer engaged by the plaintiff; Mr Brett Hawkins of PPK Environment and Infrastructure, a geotechnical engineer engaged by the plaintiff; and Mr R P Jeffery of Jeffery & Katauskas Pty Ltd, a geotechnical and environmental engineer engaged by the defendant. The primary purpose of the 6 July meeting was to establish whether contractors, who attended separately to inspect the site, believed it was feasible to construct anchored shotcrete protection to hold back the defendant's land.  
     
      
    22 After the site inspection, Jeffrey & Katauskas Pty Ltd produced a report dated 15 July 1999, which was effectively a joint report by the three engineers. The report set out a proposal for remedial work in which the land between the defendant's car park and the plaintiff's property would be regraded and then retained with reinforced shotcrete, attached to the subsurface rock shelf on the defendant's land by permanent stainless-steel rock bolts. Indicative costs given by contractors ranged from $80,000 (which the engineers thought to be on the low side) to $150,000. The work would take about six to eight weeks to complete, with the use of a crane, compressor, and storage bins for rubble - and consequently access to both properties would be essential and (I infer) there would be considerable noise and disruption. The engineers recommended a preliminary geotechnical investigation involving one or two days' drilling work to establish the location and nature of the subsurface rock shelf, at a cost of approximately $10,000 to $12,000. 
     
      
    23 The defendant responded to the report, in a constructive manner, by offering to pay half of the cost of the preliminary investigation. However, the plaintiff's response was anything but constructive. Her solicitor wrote to the defendant's solicitor on 16 August 1999 saying that unless within 14 days the defendant accepted liability for restoration of the wall and ancillary work, a proceeding would be commenced in this Court. The defendant's solicitor replied by asking the plaintiff's solicitor to indicate the legal principles and factual matters on which the plaintiff based her claim that the defendant was liable to restore wall. There was further correspondence, but this question was not satisfactorily answered before commencement of the present proceeding. 
     
      
    24 The plaintiff's property, and the defendant's land between the car park and the collapsed retaining wall, remains essentially as they were in August 1999. The bank of the defendant's land is supported by the collapsed material lying on the plaintiff's property. This collapsed material cannot be expected to remain in that state indefinitely. When it is removed, the defendant's land will have to be artificially supported in some way, to prevent soil and rubble from falling either gradually or by landslip onto the plaintiff's property. 
     
      
    The plaintiff's claims 
     
      
    25 The plaintiff commenced this proceeding by summons filed on 9 November 1999, but subsequently orders were made for pleadings. By her further amended statement of claim filed on 1 August 2001, the plaintiff seeks relief of two kinds. First, she seeks an order that the defendant forthwith take reasonable steps to abate the nuisance subsisting on its land constituted by the exposed, unretained, face of the bank adjoining the plaintiff's property. The order would require restoration work to be done in the manner contemplated by the report by Jeffery & Katauskas Pty Ltd dated 15 July 1999. The plaintiff would consent to the defendant having access over her land in order to carry out the restoration work, provided that the defendant reinstated the land at its cost in the event that any damage occurred during the restoration.  
     
      
    26 Secondly, the plaintiff seeks damages and interest to compensate her for the loss and damage she has suffered due to alleged wrongdoing by the defendant. She seeks compensation for:· the cost of construction of a new retaining wall, if her claim for a mandatory order is unsuccessful;· the cost of the demolition and full reconstruction of the cottage, which she seeks to quantify at approximately $350,000;· economic loss arising from damage to the cottage, based on loss of rent which she seeks to quantify at approximately $100,000; · the destruction of ""garden amenities"";· loss of enjoyment of the garden; and · inconvenience, embarrassment and anxiety - that is, general damages for suffering.· She claims interest on the damages awarded.  
     
      
    27 On 30 July 2001 I made orders, by consent, under Part 31 of the Supreme Court Rules, for the determination as a separate issue of the amount of damages (if any) to which either party may be entitled, and for the determination of that question to be made after determination of all other issues. The present judgment relates, therefore, to issues other than quantum of damages and in particular, to questions of liability.  
     
      
    28 The plaintiff relies on causes of action in nuisance and negligence. The plaintiff alleges, in paragraph 8 of the statement of claim, that the defendant had a duty not to create or maintain a nuisance by unreasonably exposing the plaintiff as occupier to the risk of substantial interference with her land, or loss of the use and enjoyment of it. She says that the fill material deposited by the defendant above and behind the retaining wall, which the defendant allowed to remain in place, constituted a legal nuisance. The plaintiff also alleges, in paragraph 9B of the statement of claim, that the defendant owed her a duty not to remove the trees and other significant vegetation on its land above the retaining wall, without replacing what was removed with something that would hold the fill material in place. She says that this duty was breached during the period from 1980 to August 1998 when trees and vegetation were from time to time removed. 
     
      
    29 An essential ingredient of the plaintiff's case, both in nuisance and in negligence, is to establish causation. The plaintiff says that the ""dominant direct cause"" of the failure of the wall was an increase in hydrostatic pressure against it. The plaintiff's experts say that immediately prior to the failure of the wall, water collected behind it and, as a result of the heavy rain immediately prior to the collapse, sufficient hydrostatic pressure built up to move the wall from its base. The defendant does not dispute this contention.  
     
      
    30 The plaintiff says that a ""second material cause"" of the failure of the wall, sufficient to provide a causal nexus between the defendant's wrongdoing and her loss, was that unretained fill material on the defendant's land above the wall moved down to the wall, and absorbed and held water, thereby increasing the lateral pressure on the wall. She says that the fill material was vulnerable to movement because the defendant had, over preceding years, removed several large trees from the vicinity, the roots of which had retained the fill material. 
     
      
    The defence 
     
      
    31 The defendant denies liability. First, it denies that it had the duties alleged in paragraphs 8 and 9B. Secondly, it contends that its conduct, including the deposit of fill material in 1960, was a reasonable user of the land (thus meeting the plaintiff's claim in nuisance), and that changes in the state of the vegetation on the defendant's land above the retaining wall occurred without negligence on its part.  
     
      
    32 Thirdly, it says that the failure of the retaining wall was not caused by any act or omission on its part, but the material cause was the plaintiff's own conduct and omissions, in failing to take reasonable care to maintain the wall.  
     
      
    33 The defendant's experts contend that the fill material in the vicinity of the retaining wall played no material part in the failure of the wall, and by reason of its composition, could not hold any significant quantity of water. Further, the defendant's experts contend that the asserted changes in the plant cover would have had no significant effect on the lateral pressure applied to the wall. They say that failure of the wall was probably due to a combination of factors, including the unusual rainwater loading during the storm just prior to the failure, design defects in the wall, the blocking of weep holes, and the deterioration of the mortar over a period of 70 years. 
     
      
    34 Fourthly, the defendant raises a defence of volenti non fit injuria, contending that the plaintiff voluntarily, and with full knowledge of the circumstances and of the risk and consequences of failure of the wall, accepted that risk and those consequences. Fifthly, the defendant says that the plaintiff has failed to mitigate the damage that arose from any act or omission on its part that the Court may find to be wrongful. Sixthly, the defendant raises a defence of contributory negligence, alleging that the plaintiff failed to take reasonable care to maintain the structural integrity of the wall.  
     
      
    The defendant's cross-claim 
     
      
    35 By its cross-claim the defendant alleges, first, that the plaintiff owed it a duty of care to maintain and not reduce the structural integrity of the wall, and not to cause its collapse, and says that she breached that duty. Secondly, it alleges that the wall constituted a hazard on the plaintiff's property, which she failed to abate. Thirdly, it alleges that the defendant has acquired by prescription an easement for support of its property from the plaintiff's property, by its continuous assertion of a right of support for a period in excess of 20 years prior to the failure of the wall, and that the plaintiff breached her obligations under the easement. As cross-claimant, the defendant seeks damages, an order that the plaintiff abate the nuisance caused by failure of the retaining wall, and a declaration that it has acquired an easement for support, with a consequential order that the Register be amended to record the easement. 
     
      
    Factual and legal issues 
     
      
    36 The parties are in dispute with respect to some crucial factual matters, namely:· the nature, quantity and location of the fill material deposited by the defendant near the car park in 1960/61;· the extent to which the defendant removed trees and vegetation from its land above the retaining wall during the 1980s and 1990s; and· the cause or causes of collapse of the retaining wall. 
     
      
    37 I shall consider the evidence on these questions and make findings, and then I shall apply these findings to the plaintiff's and defendant's causes of action. In doing so, I shall consider some aspects of the law with respect to nuisance, duties of care and easements by prescription. I shall consider the conflicting submissions of the parties on some aspects of the law, including the circumstances in which the Court will grant a mandatory injunction to require a defendant to construct a retaining wall to prevent future slippage of the defendant's land onto the plaintiff's land, having regard to Leakey v National Trust [1980] 1 QB 485. For reasons I shall explain, it is unnecessary to resolve disagreements between the parties as to the precise test of causation in the law of torts, the meaning and effect of s 177 of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW), and the availability of an easement for support by prescription with respect to Torrens title land. 
     
      
    Deposit of fill material near the car park 
     
      
    38 The carport structure for the defendant's property was designed by H. R. Smith & Lascelles in approximately December 1960. The evidence, including drawings prepared by Smith & Lascelles and the oral evidence of Mr Lascelles, indicates that the floor slab of the car park is supported by columns founded on sandstone bedrock (or on natural ground at a distance having no effect on the retaining wall). That being so, the structure did not impart any load on the retaining wall below it. 
     
      
    39 The plans prepared by Smith & Lascelles provide for ""back fill, rock faced"" to be placed on the defendant's land between the car park and the retaining wall. At the northern end, the fill is shown as sloping upwards to the car park slab at a point approximately half way between the retaining wall and the car park, the ground being almost level in the area from the retaining wall to the midpoint. However, at the southern end the fill slopes up, apparently more steeply, from the retaining wall to the car park, and there is no level area. The plan shows a stone buttress supporting the wall at the southern end. 
     
      
    40 Mr Lascelles gave evidence that late in 1960, he inspected the site and examined the retaining wall, both from the defendant's land and from the plaintiff's land. He said the wall presented as solid and secure, and he concluded that it was sound. He wrote to the Council on 6 December 1960, reporting on his inspection of the retaining wall. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The filling to be placed under the car park area will only have an effect on the retaining wall at the end where the two structures converge and at this end the filling amounts to very little more than is at present on the site. Moreover at this point the wall has a stone buttress which will considerably assist it to take any additional load. In our opinion the amount of extra load being placed on the wall is negligible."" 
        
       
      
    41 In his report dated 21 August 1998, Mr Knox said that the collapse of the wall had exposed sandy material below the original topsoil. He said: ""Filling material is evident above the natural ground material although this may only be of minimum depth, as the natural ground possibly rises further up the slope"". He also expressed some concern about the stability of the carport slabs on the top of the slope, which appeared to him to have undergone some remedial work. He advised that the adjoining owners be informed of the need to stabilise the car parking area, independently of the recent collapse, because of a ""long-term movement problem, of the poorly compacted filling that these slabs were cast on in the mid-1960s when originally constructed"". Other evidence indicates, however, that the carport slab was built on columns placed on the sandstone shelf at its western end, and the plaintiff has not contended either that the car park was poorly constructed or that it had become unstable by the time of collapse of the retaining wall. 
     
      
    42 Mr W O Sherrard of AH Baigent & Associates Pty Ltd, a consulting engineer, prepared a report dated 28 August 1998 for the insurer, AAMI. He observed that the soil profile at the face of the defendant's land consisted of weathered sandstone rock overlain by brown loam and then brown topsoil, on top of which was fill material of varying depth, but he said that the soil profile should be confirmed by geotechnical report. 
     
      
    43 According to Mr Pilz, the fill material was a sandy fill that would allow water falling on it readily to pass through. Mr Lascelles gave evidence that he directed that the fill be ""good clean fill"". The plaintiff alleges that material other than fill material was placed by the defendant above the retaining wall. She gave evidence that in April 1999 she inspected the debris on her property following the collapse of the wall some months earlier. She noticed that the debris included rusted metal which resembled guttering, broken slate tiles, building debris and broken bricks, as well as soil, dirt, rocks and rock fragments. 
     
      
    44 I found Mr Lascelles to be a helpful witness whose evidence I accept. He was closely involved in planning for the construction of the car park and advised on the deposit of the fill material. The other witnesses observed the site substantially later than the time when the fill material was deposited, and their evidence (though it is expert evidence) is necessarily the reconstruction of what was done when the car park was constructed, involving an element of speculation. Assessing the evidence as a whole, I have concluded that a quantity of fill material was deposited by the defendant on its land between the car park and the retaining wall in 1960/1961, at a time when the car park was constructed. On the basis (discussed below) that Mr Lascelles's plan was followed by the builder, the greatest quantity of fill was towards the southern end of the boundary. However, even there, the quantity of fill was not large enough to place any substantial additional lateral pressure on the retaining wall. The fill material was sandy and porous and did not retain water for a greater time than the topsoil in the area.  
     
      
    45 With some hesitation, I have concluded that I should reject the plaintiff's evidence to the effect that building rubble and building debris (as distinct from sandy fill material) had been deposited above the retaining wall. Her evidence that she observed material of this kind after the collapse of the wall is not supported by the other evidence. Neither Mr Knox nor Mr Sherrard, who inspected the site shortly after the wall collapsed, records the presence of any such material. 
     
      
    46 I am not able to conclude, on the evidence before me, that the defendant failed to comply with Mr Lascelles' stipulation that the fill be ""rock faced"". The evidence on this point is unsatisfactory. Mr Lascelles did not supervise the placement of the fill, but he said (and I accept) that the builder was reputable. Mr Lascelles also gave evidence, not challenged, that the ""rock faced batters"" were not necessary to retain the compacted fill in place.  
     
      
    47 Witnesses who inspected the site after the collapse (including Mr Knox and Mr Sherrard, whose inspections were soon after the collapse) did not identify any material that was clearly rock facing, but in the period from 1961 to 1998 the whole area between the car park and the retaining wall was overgrown with vegetation, and any initial rock facing may well not have been obvious in either the collapsed or the stable areas of the land.  
     
      
    48 The defendant submits that as the works required council approval, there is every reason to infer that they were either inspected or certified. I am prepared to make that inference, and the inference (coupled with the evidence of Mr Lascelles) leads me to conclude on balance that his requirements for the fill to be rock faced were complied with by the builder. If I had been unable to reach this conclusion, the onus would still have been on the plaintiff will have been to prove, as she puts it, ""culpable conduct"" on the part of the defendant, and in the state of the evidence she has failed to prove any culpable conduct by failure to comply with Mr Lascelles drawing. 
     
      
    49 I agree with the plaintiff that there is no evidence that the defendant took any step, after the car park had been erected, to ensure that what had been done did not impose any additional load on the retaining wall. I infer, however, that having engaged a competent engineer and builder to do the job, which required Council approval, they relied on the engineer and builder to produce work that was reasonably safe and to satisfy Council's requirements.  
     
      
    Removal of vegetation 
     
      
    50 The plaintiff gave evidence that, when she first moved into her property, there were trees and vegetation on the defendant's land adjacent to the retaining wall boundary. She said the trees and vegetation were so dense she could not see the car park from the rear of her house. While she could not recall the number of trees, she recalled that there were poplars, pines, a ficus and a palm and other vegetation. 
     
      
    51 According to the plaintiff, over the years of her occupation of her house, a number of trees and some vegetation were removed from the defendant's land above the retaining wall, including a poplar and a pine. She was unable to specify when this occurred, but it was several years before 1998. The consequence was that for some years prior to August 1998, the car park was visible from the rear of her house, according to her evidence.  
     
      
    52 The plaintiff's daughter Amy lived at the plaintiff's property until late 1991. In approximately 1983 she moved from the house to the cottage. Her evidence was that when she was a child, the land immediately above the wall was densely covered in vegetation, undergrowth and trees. She said that she could not see the car park from the rear of her mother's property. However, she said she remembered that over time, trees were removed and vegetation thinned out so that the car park became visible from her mother's property. 
     
      
    53 Before the collapse of the wall in August 1998, the top of the wall was covered with honeysuckle, lantana, ivy and other weeds and vines. The plaintiff gave evidence that this vegetation would constantly grow over the wall and down into her property. Approximately twice each year, she said, she would try to clear as much of the growth as she could from the wall. She was sometimes assisted by her daughter Amy, and after Amy's marriage, her husband. Amy's evidence corroborated the plaintiff's evidence on these points. 
     
      
    54 The plaintiff gave evidence that from the late 1970s onwards, she rang the office manager of the defendant at least once per year requesting him to clear the weeds which were growing on to her property. She said on one occasion in about 1979 or 1980 the vegetation, over a very short time, had grown across the roof of the cottage and into the chimney pot. 
     
      
    55 She said that, at the time of collapse of the wall, there remained only some vegetation, the ficus (located near the car park), two other trees, and a pine and a smaller tree both of which fell onto the cottage. As I have said, photographic evidence shows a pine tree and another smaller tree lying horizontally across the remains of the retaining wall and onto the roof of the cottage. 
     
      
    56 The evidence of the plaintiff and her daughter was contradicted to a degree, by the evidence of Mr John Wood, a director of the defendant. He has lived in a residential home unit in the defendant's building since 1977, facing over the car park. He said in his affidavit that as far as he could recall, during the period of his residence the vegetation between the car park and the retaining wall consisted of vines, grasses and weeds in the nature of ground cover and a few trees, and that he was not aware of the removal of any trees. His oral evidence was not entirely consistent with his affidavit, because he said that he became aware of the nature of the ground cover to the west of the carport only around 1996/97. This suggests that he did not pay much attention to the vegetation near the car park, and consequently that his evidence of unawareness of the removal of trees should not be given great weight.  
     
      
    57 He inspected the defendant's files and said there was no record of any complaint by the plaintiff concerning the presence of plants on or near the retaining wall, and he was unaware of any such complaint. There are some minutes of meetings of the defendant's directors at which the pruning and removal of trees were discussed, but they do not indicate whether the trees were in the vicinity of the car park. 
     
      
    58 On 12 July 1991 Woollahra Council issued a Tree Preservation Order authorising the lopping or removal of two pines and the trimming of a poplar located at the rear of the carport. The conditions of the consent noted that two umbrella trees and two pines appeared to be poisoned, and that a poplar behind the carport was dead. The Council required removal of dead wood from jacaranda trees and wattle. On 25 October 1991 the Council issued another order authorising the removal of a poplar located at the rear of the carport. Mr Wood said he had no recollection whether the works authorised by the Council were in fact performed, and that he was not aware of the removal of any trees or vegetation from the area between the car park and the retaining wall. 
     
      
    59 The evidence of the plaintiff and her daughter is rather unspecific and unclear, and yet it seems to me probable, on balance, that some trees were removed from the defendant's land between the car park and the retaining wall during the period from 1980 to 1998, as they say. The important questions are: when did this occur, and how many trees were removed? It does not appear that any trees were removed in the second half of the 1990s, for if they were, the plaintiff and Mr Wood should have been able to give more specific evidence of those events.  
     
      
    60 On the scant evidence available, it seems to me appropriate to infer that the poplar tree and some dead trees were removed in 1991 in accordance with Council's orders, and that these are the events recollected by the plaintiff and her daughter. The evidence does not permit me to find that trees were removed at any other time, although in response to the plaintiff's complaints, it is likely that the defendant thinned the vegetation occasionally. Nor does the evidence permit me to find that the roots of trees were wholly removed. That is of some significance, because of the binding effect of trees, according to the expert evidence, is produced by the size and complexity of the root formation.  
     
      
    61 I should note that there is no evidence that the plaintiff complained to the defendant about the removal of the trees, or expressed concern about the affect their removal may have on the stability of the embankment. 
     
      
    The plaintiff's maintenance of the retaining wall 
     
      
    62 The plaintiff gave evidence that approximately twice per year, usually when she was clearing the vegetation that had grown over the wall, she cleared the weep holes by inserting her garden fork into each hole and removing any dirt or other material. She said that on occasions the holes would be partly filled with a black, soft, fungus-like material which was easy to remove with her fork. On occasions there would be tiny ferns growing out of the holes, which she also removed. She says she never saw any evidence of the mortar in the wall crumbling, nor any cracks in the wall. The evidence of the plaintiff's daughter Amy corroborated the plaintiff's evidence on these points. 
     
      
    63 Mr Knox, who inspected the site on 10 August 1998 after the wall had collapsed, said that weep holes, if they existed in the collapsed section of the wall, may possibly have been blocked and insufficient to cope with the amount of saturation contained in the ground. Mr Sherrard, whose report dated 28 August 1998 followed an inspection, observed only one weep hole in the remaining part of the wall and said it appeared to be partially blocked by a bituminous substance. 
     
      
    64 The plaintiff's evidence that she occasionally cleaned the weep holes of a black substance is consistent with Mr Sherrard's evidence that he observed a weep hole partially blocked by a bituminous substance. I accept the plaintiff's evidence on this subject. Dr Barda accepted that if the weep holes were blocked, rainfall would have ""tanked"" behind the wall, and it was likely that the weep holes were blocked. His evidence does not mean, however, that the plaintiff failed to do what she could reasonably do to keep the weep holes clear. The wall was quite thick at the level of the weep holes, and it would be unreasonable to expect that the full length of the weep holes would be regularly cleared, and unlikely according to Dr Barda that if they were, the wall would have survived. 
     
      
    65 Dr Barda accepted that lime mortar powder would have been visible on the wall when it was dry, and Mr Knox gave evidence that if the wall was being progressively moved by natural forces, then it would have bowed and this would have been visible. However, there is no evidence that the plaintiff or her daughter saw anything to cause apprehension. I do not accept that there was anything observable to suggest that the wall was in decay. 
     
      
    Causes of collapse of the retaining wall  
     
      
    66 In his report dated 15 June 1999, based on an inspection shortly before that time, Dr Barda expressed the view that a large section of the defendant's property had undergone a substantial slip that had been responsible for the collapse of the retaining wall: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The collapse of the wall has resulted from a build up of soil pressure that has probably been aggravated by the presence of water in the subsoil.""  
        
       
      
    67 He said it was impossible to ascertain the cause of the landslip, but that there was a possibility that the landslip had resulted from additional fill being placed on the defendant's property following the construction of the parking area. He recommended a search of Council's records to ascertain the state of the property prior to the construction of the parking area. 
     
      
    68 Dr Barda inspected the property again and wrote a report dated 30 March 2000, after reading the report by Mr Hawkins dated 23 March 2000. He adhered to his view that the collapse of the wall was caused by the movement of fill material placed on the defendant's land at the time of construction of the parking area. He said the effect of the fill was less significant at the northern end of the wall because the horizontal distance between the fill and the wall was greater, but at the southern end the fill was quite close to the wall and its effect was much more significant. Groundwater had a contributing effect to the collapse of the wall, and water penetration of the fill material saturated it and increased pressure, but the effects of groundwater and soil saturation alone would not be enough to cause the collapse. He noted that vegetation in the area of the fill material had the effect of binding the fill with roots, and absorbing groundwater, and so the removal of significant trees prior to August 1998 would have contributed to the collapse of the wall. 
     
      
    69 I have found Dr Barda's evidence as to the cause of the collapse of the wall to be unconvincing. He did not inspect the site until about 10 months after the collapse of the wall, and seems to have approached the problem with a preconceived idea of the cause. I say this because, in his first report, he asserted categorically that the collapse was caused by a landslip and that the presence of water was only an aggravating factor, without advancing any reasons for that view. Moreover, he said that there was a possibility that the landslip resulted from additional fill being placed by the defendant on its property following construction of the parking area, without having searched Council's records.  
     
      
    70 His second report was an attempt to justify the conclusions in his first report. Both reports, and his oral evidence, gave me the impression that his opinion was intended to assist the plaintiff and to support a theory of causation that she or her advisers had put to him. He did not satisfactorily explain why, if the movement of fill material caused the wall to collapse, it collapsed near the northern end as well as at the southern end. His explanation of the cause seems to me inconsistent with the fact that the centre segment of the wall moved laterally rather than toppling over. Further, his conclusions in his two reports are inconsistent with the joint view to which he subscribed, in a report dated 13 June 2000 (noted below). 
     
      
    71 Mr Hawkins and his colleague, Mr Yip, wrote a report dated 23 March 2000. The report was based on several site visits during the period from 11 June 1999 to 17 January 2000. They expressed the opinion that the failure of the brick retaining wall should be attributed to: 
     
      
      (a) the presence of additional surcharge loadings on the wall due to the close proximity of the fill and carport structures on the defendant's land; 
       
      (b) the heavy rainfall on and before the day of collapse, causing the fill material to increase in moisture content (possibly becoming saturated), which further increased the potential for surcharge loading on the wall; 
       
      (c) the apparently poor or non-existent drainage system at the fill batter and behind the retaining wall; and 
       
      (d) removal of a number of significant trees from the fill batter in recent years. 
       
      
    72 They calculated that any fill placed within two metres behind the face of the wall was likely to have acted as a surcharge load on the wall, resulting in additional lateral pressure. They also calculated that if fill were placed directly behind the wall it would increase the lateral pressure on the wall by more than 100%. For the fill to be more than two metres from the wall at the southern end, the batter would have had to be placed at an angle of approximately 58 degrees. Instability of the batter surface, and slumping of the batter, would be very likely, particularly when water was introduced into the slope.  
     
      
    73 Mr Hawkins gave oral evidence, and was cross-examined on some correspondence between him and the plaintiff's solicitor. It appeared to me, observing him in the witness box and reading that correspondence, that Mr Hawkins did not properly understand his role as an expert witness, even though he read the Expert Witness Code of Conduct. He saw himself as briefed to develop the plaintiff's case that the collapse of the wall was the defendant's fault. He put forward several ideas as to the possible cause of the collapse, and then selected and advocated the one that seemed most plausible. He did not observe substantial fill material during his inspections, the earliest of which was in any event more than 10 months after the wall had collapsed. He did not take into account Mr Knox's observation that filling material evident above the natural ground material may only have been of minimum depth.  
     
      
    74 Mr Hawkins was reluctant to spell out the contribution that the fill material may have had to the collapse of the wall. I was left with the impression that both Mr Hawkins and Dr Barda regarded the fill material as contributing to the failure in a ""scientific"" sense - that is, as a mass theoretically capable of adding a lateral loading. Supporting this conclusion is Dr Barda's acknowledgement in cross-examination that 10 kilos of lawn clippings would be considered a surcharge. 
     
      
    75 Overall, I accept Mr Hawkins' calculations as to the lateral pressure created by the deposit of fill material in the vicinity of the wall, but I do not accept some of his factual assumptions. Specifically, I do not accept that a quantity of fill material sufficient to create any significant lateral pressure was placed within two metres of the wall, for the reasons I have already given (relying in particular on the evidence of Mr Lascelles). Moreover, his assertions about poor drainage of the fill batter and the removal of trees in recent years are contrary to my findings on these matters. 
     
      
    76 Mr Knox's conclusion, in his report dated 21 August 1998, was that the wall failed as a result of the hydrostatic pressure build up behind it, due to the wet period around the time of the collapse, resulting in lateral forces greater than expected of the wall during its design life. Mr Knox said the weep holes, if they were provided in the portion of the wall that had collapsed, may possibly have been blocked and insufficient to withstand the amount of saturation contained in the ground. I find his observations to be plausible. 
     
      
    77 Mr Sherrard, reporting to the insurer on 28 August 1998, expressed the opinion that the fill material on the defendant's property had moved but there had been no general landslip. In his view, the wall collapsed due to a build up of hydraulic pressure behind the wall during the extended period of wet weather being experienced in Sydney during the previous months. The hydraulic pressure moved the wall forward and it fell off the rock shelf on which it had been constructed. He said it was likely that the fill on the slope behind the wall ""contributed to the overturning forces on the wall"" and was thus a contributing factor to the collapse. I find Mr Sherrard's observations as to the cause of the collapse to be plausible, except that in view of the evidence of Mr Lascelles, to treat the fill material as a ""contributing factor"" to the collapse is to overstate its effect. Mr Sherrard did not consider the stabilising effect of the stone buttressing at the southern end. 
     
      
    78 Expert evidence was given on behalf of the defendant by Mr Rick Pilz, a principal structural engineer at Gutteridge Haskins & Davey Pty Ltd. His first report, giving answers to specific questions asked by the defendant's solicitors, was dated 25 May 2000. His second report, though undated, was approved for issue on 21 June 2001. He first inspected the site on 1 February 2000, and he relied on information contained in other reports.  
     
      
    79 He identified four contributing factors to the collapse of the wall. The first and most significant was the structural inadequacy of the wall. He said that the wall had both insufficient overturning stability and insufficient sliding resistance. The second factor, which he also regarded as very significant, was the storm event on 7 August 1998. He said that the hydrostatic force imposed on the wall during the lengthy period of heavy rainfall was the trigger for the wall's failure at that time. Thirdly, he drew attention to the inadequacy of drainage through the wall, either because of insufficient weep holes, or their blockage.  
     
      
    80 Fourthly, he said that fill material placed within the ""zone of influence"" of the wall when the car park was constructed could have contributed to the failure. In his first report he said that the lateral soil pressure to the retaining wall was increased by the fill material, and therefore would have been a ""contributing factor"", but the increase would have been relatively small and localised towards the southern end and therefore the placing of fill material on the land could not be referred to as the cause of the wall's collapse. In his second report he said that, having regard to the inadequacies of design and of drainage through the wall, the wall would be likely to have collapsed even without the fill material. His opinion, based on the drawing prepared by Smith & Lascelles, was that the fill material that the northern end was remote enough from the retaining wall that it was unlikely to have any effect, but at the southern end it may have been placed close to the wall and may have increased the lateral loading. He noted, however, that it appeared that the fill material was placed in proximity to an intersecting stone buttress which would have improved stability at that point. 
     
      
    81 In his first report, Mr Pilz said that in his opinion, removal of a number of significant trees was not likely to have been a contributing factor to the failure of the wall, although removal of trees could lead to local slumping of the batter slope, transporting the fill material closer to the retaining wall and thus increasing lateral pressures. 
     
      
    82 Mr Pilz did not inspect the site until well after the collapse, but it is clear from his reports that he reviewed in a comprehensive fashion the observations and work of other experts. His views are consistent with the views of Mr Lascelles. I accept his evidence.  
     
      
    83 As a result of directions made by the Court on 26 May 2000, Dr Barda, Mr Pilz and Mr Hawkins met on the site on 13 June 2000, and each of them signed a brief joint report consequent upon the meeting. The joint report is not particularly informative, because it represents a ""lowest common denominator"" of the experts' views, especially on the significance of the fill material. The experts said that while the construction of the wall was theoretically inadequate, the fact that the wall stood up for a period of 80 years indicated that it was behaving in a marginally adequate manner. They agreed that the addition of the fill material associated with construction of the car park locally increased the lateral forces applied to the wall and would have ""aggravated the marginal condition"" of the state of the wall. They observed that ""the predominant cause of failure of the wall was the increase in ground water flow, which resulting from the unusually intense storm period preceding the collapse"". The joint report did not say whether the increase in lateral forces caused by the fill material was negligible (as Mr Lascelles said) or was a contributing factor (as Mr Sherrard said). Nor did it consider the effect of the stone buttressing at the southern end. 
     
      
    84 All the experts agree that the increase in the hydrostatic pressure to the wall after heavy rainfall was a very significant causal element. Hydrostatic pressure applied at the base of the wall provides a plausible explanation for the lateral movement of the wall off the rock shelf. The experts also agree that there were other causal factors at work. I find that both of those propositions are true. Once there was a build up of hydrostatic pressure, water could not drain away because of inadequacies in the design of the wall and the inefficient operation of the weep holes. There is no specific explanation for the fact that for more than 70 years after the construction of the wall, and 37 years after the work on the car park, the wall remained standing, notwithstanding many storms comparable to the one that occurred on 7 August 1998. However, that does not destroy the plausibility of the view that the hydrostatic pressure created by storm water on 7 August 1998 was the predominant cause of the collapse - the collapse of a wall which, by then, was over 70 years old. There is some evidence that the wall may possibly have collapsed within the ensuing 24 hours in any case, irrespective of the presence of fill or other postulated causes. 
     
      
    85 Counsel for the plaintiff made numerous submissions on the significance of the fill material. First, counsel invited me to infer that the fill material substantially surcharged the wall at its southern end. He referred to the evidence of Dr Barda, which I accept, that the natural angle of repose of sand is about 26-30 degrees, while noting that according to Mr Hawkins' report of 23 March 2000, the necessary batter of the fill material if placed so as not to surcharge the wall would be 58 degrees. He invited me to infer that, if the fill material was placed at that sharp angle initially, it would inevitably have slipped towards its natural angle of repose and thus moved to the wall. But I am not prepared to make that inference, given my findings as to compliance with Mr Lascelles' plans and directions and the probability, therefore, that the fill was ""good clean fill"" tightly compacted and supported by rock facing.  
     
      
    86 Counsel said that if the fill material had been compacted or rammed when it was deposited, this would have spread it. But as counsel for the defendant submitted, this amounted to giving evidence (indeed, not particularly plausible evidence) from the bar table. In any event, it is far from self-evident that ramming would cause the fill to spread rather than to compact into a smaller space.  
     
      
    87 In the course of cross-examination and in submissions, counsel for the plaintiff developed two theories about the significance of the fill material to the collapse of the wall. Perhaps under the influence of the engineering experts, we adopted quasi-scientific labels for the theories, calling them the dynamic theory and the static theory.  
     
      
    88 According to the dynamic theory, moments prior to the failure of the wall, a significant quantity of the fill material, then saturated with rainwater, slumped toward the wall and thereby suddenly and substantially increased the lateral loading on the wall. There is no direct evidence that such an event occurred. Dr Barda described the proposition as theoretical. Mr Knox and Mr Pilz pointed out that since the natural ground level sloped to the wall, if the fill had moved it would simply have fallen over the top of the wall. The theory is not compatible with the observed fact that the wall (or at least the centre segment) moved laterally at its base, rather than toppling over through the application of pressure at its top. Mr Pilz agreed in cross-examination that saturation of uncompacted fill can be a factor leading to its slumping and that the removal of vegetation (by which he meant removal of the root system as well as the plant) is the removal of a stabilising factor. But this evidence falls far short of supporting the dynamic theory. My finding that the fill was deposited in accordance with Mr Lascelles' requirements adds to the unlikelihood of a slump occurring in the manner postulated by counsel. My conclusion is that the dynamic theory is implausible and I reject it. 
     
      
    89 According to the static theory, the fact that the fill material was not sufficiently retained and had no adequate diversionary drainage system meant that the saturation of the fill by rainwater would, of itself, increase materially the loading on the wall; and this would have been sufficient, even without slumping, to trigger the failure of the wall. Counsel points to the evidence of Mr Pilz that the wall had a margin of safety of less than 1, and therefore invites the Court to infer, although Mr Pilz was reluctant to concede the point, that the additional load required to cause the wall to collapse was relatively small. I am prepared to accept that, because of design inadequacies in the wall, the margin of safety was low. It does not follow, however, that the presence of fill material was a significant causal factor. In my opinion the fill material deposited on the defendant's land in 1960/1961 was not a significant causal factor, in light of the opinions of Mr Lascelles and Mr Pilz, even though it increased lateral forces to a minor or negligible extent towards the southern end of the wall.  
     
      
    90 Further, in my opinion the removal of the poplar and dead trees in 1991 was not a causal factor, having regard to the presence of other vegetation to bind the soil and fill material, the limited number of trees involved, and the expert opinion of Mr Pilz. 
     
      
    Leakey's case 
     
      
    91 In support of her claim for an injunction and damages, the plaintiff invokes Leakey v National Trust. In that case the National Trust owned land called ""Burrow Mump"", a conical hill rising steeply from the Somerset plain. The home of Mr and Mrs Leakey was at the base of the hill. The hill was unstable and prone to slip, although nothing had been done by the National Trust to affect that propensity. From time to time minor landslides deposited material on the Leakeys' property, and they complained to the National Trust, which did not act. Since at least 1968, the National Trust appreciated that the bank of the hill adjacent to the Leakeys' property belonged to the Trust and was a threat to the houses below it.  
     
      
    92 After a hot, dry summer in 1976 followed by an unusually wet autumn, a large crack opened up in the bank and Mrs Leakey drew the National Trust's attention to it, but they declined to do anything about it. A few weeks later, there was a large fall of the bank causing extensive damage to the Leakeys' property. The estimated cost of clearance and protective works was substantial. 
     
      
    93 Mr and Mrs Leakey took proceedings for injunctions to prevent the National Trust from permitting its earth to move onto their property and to require the Trust to remove the material that had already fallen. They also sought damages for nuisance. They sought and obtained an interlocutory injunction, on their undertaking as to damages, which had the effect of requiring the National Trust to take steps to prevent earth from moving from Burrow Mump onto the Leakeys' property. That work having been done by the Trust before the final hearing, it appears that Mr and Mrs Leakey sought only damages by way of final relief, and they were successful. 
     
      
    94 Prior to Leakey's case, it had been thought that in English law, neither the owner nor the occupier of land from which, solely as a result of natural causes, natural mineral material encroached on to, or threatened to encroach on to, adjoining land, causing damage, was under any liability to the adjoining landowner. A dictum of Lord Cairns LC in Rylands v Fletcher (1868) LR 3 HL 330, 338, was thought to have this effect. But the proposition had been eloquently criticised by Professor A L Goodhart (""Liability for Things Naturally on the Land"", (1930) 4 CLJ 13), and there were some cases (cited by Megaw LJ in Leakey's case) that had reached results inconsistent with the proposition.  
     
      
    95 In Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan [1940] AC 880 a local authority trespassed on the defendant's land and placed a culvert in a ditch on the land. The culvert was improperly constructed and created a danger of flooding onto the plaintiff's land. Subsequently the defendant came to know what had been done, and should have realised the risk of flooding to the plaintiff's land, but he did nothing. The plaintiff's land was damaged by a flood, and the House of Lords (speaking after the development of the law of negligence in Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562) held that the defendant was liable to pay damages. While the defendant had not done anything amounting to an unnatural user of his land and had not brought anything unnatural onto his land, he knew of the risk of flooding and had a duty to use reasonable care to prevent it. 
     
      
    96 Sedleigh-Denfield was not a case in which the damage to the plaintiff's land had been brought about by natural causes, but (as Megaw LJ pointed out in Leakey's at 517) the whole tenor of the speeches in the House of Lords suggested that in their Lordships' opinion, the same duty of care would have arisen if the condition had been brought about by natural causes. The High Court of Australia and the Privy Council applied the Sedleigh-Denfield principle to a case where the risk of damage arose out of natural causes, in Goldman v Hargrave [1967] AC 645 (Privy Council); (1963) 110 CLR 40 (High Court). There a tall tree on the defendant's land was struck by lightning and caught fire. The defendant cleared a space around the tree and sprayed the surrounding area with water to prevent the fire from spreading, and on the next day, the tree was cut down and the defendant left it to burn itself out. He did nothing else to prevent the fire from spreading on his land and to adjoining land. Two days later, the weather changed and a hot wind revived the fire and spread it onto the plaintiff's property. The Supreme Court of Western Australia held that the defendant was not liable to compensate the plaintiff, because he owed no duty to the plaintiff to extinguish the fire, which had been ignited and had spread through natural causes. The High Court allowed the plaintiff's appeal, holding that after he arranged for the tree to be cut down, the defendant had a duty to use reasonable care to prevent it causing damage to his neighbours. The Privy Council agreed. 
     
      
    97 Their Lordships expressly rejected the suggested distinction between risks originating from natural and ""non-natural"" causes. They said (at 661): 
     
      
       
        
        ""It was suggested as a logical basis for the distinction that in the case of a hazard originating in an act of man, an occupier who fails to deal with it can be said to be using his land in a manner detrimental to his neighbour and so to be within the classic field of responsibility in nuisance, whereas this cannot be said when the hazard originates without human action so long at least as the occupier merely abstains. The fallacy of this argument is that, as already explained, the basis of the occupier's liability lies not in the use of his land: in the absence of ""adoption"" there is no such use; but in the neglect of action in the face of something which may damage his neighbour. To this, the suggested distinction is irrelevant."" 
        
       
      
    98 In Leakey's case the English Court of Appeal chose to follow Goldman v Hargrave even though the decision of the Privy Council was not strictly binding on it. The Court held that the National Trust owed a duty of care to Mr and Mrs Leakey in relation to the hazard constituted by the propensity of the earth on Burrow Mump to slip onto their land. Since the Trust was well aware of the propensity of the earth to slip, it had a duty to take such steps as were reasonable in all the circumstances to prevent or minimise the risk of injury or damage to Mr and Mrs Leakey and their property. As to the scope of the duty, Megaw LJ said (at 524): 
     
      
       
        
        ""The duty is a duty to do that which is reasonable in all the circumstances, and no more than what, if anything, is reasonable, to prevent or minimise the known risk of damage or injury to one's neighbour or to his property. The considerations with which the law is familiar are all to be taken into account in deciding whether there has been a breach of duty, and, if so, what that breach is, and whether it is causative of the damage in respect of which the claim is made. Thus, there will fall to be considered the extent of the risk; what, so far as reasonably can be foreseen, are the chances that anything untoward will happen or that any damage will be caused? What is to be foreseen as to the possible extent of the damage if the risk becomes a reality? Is it practicable to prevent, or to minimise, the happening of any damage? If it is practicable, how simple or how difficult are the measures which could be taken, how much and how lengthy work do they involve, and what is the probable cost of such works? Was there sufficient time for preventive action to have been taken, by persons acting reasonably in relation to the known risk, between the time when it became known to, or should have been realised by, the defendant, and the time when the damage occurred? Factors such as these, so far as they apply in a particular case, fall to be weighed in deciding whether the defendant's duty of care requires, or required, him to do anything, and, if so, what."" 
        
       
      
    99 Counsel for the plaintiff in the present case submitted that Leakey's case reflects Australian law. He was not able to cite any Australian case in which Leakey's case had been applied, but he referred to Morgan v Lake Macquarie City Council (New South Wales Court of Appeal, unreported, 2 September 1993) in which Clarke JA assumed that a cause of action based upon Goldman v Hargrave and Leakey's case was soundly based in law, and Gunnedah Shire Council v Hansen (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Powell J, unreported, 12 August 1993) in which his Honour referred to Leakey's case but did not deal with the general principle upheld by the English Court of Appeal. Despite the absence of direct authority, I have no doubt that the principle in Leakey's case would be applied in this country, since Leakey's case in turn is an application to English law of the principles of Australian law enunciated by the High Court and Privy Council in Goldman v Hargrave. 
     
      
    100 The plaintiff also refers to some earlier cases bearing factual analogies with the circumstances of the present case: Broder v Saillard (1876) LR 2 Ch 692; Wilkins v Leighton [1932] 2 Ch 106. These cases were decided before the Sedleigh-Denton, Goldman and Leakey cases, and it would not be safe to regard them as reflecting the modern law. 
     
      
    101 The plaintiff seeks to apply Leakey's case to the present facts in two ways. First, she relies on Leakey's case to support her claim for a mandatory injunction, and secondly, she relies on the case to support her claim for damages for nuisance.  
     
      
    The mandatory injunction to restrain future slippage  
     
      
    102 I agree with the plaintiff that the evidence establishes that, as at the time of the hearing: 
     
      
      (a) if soil on the defendant's land is not retained, it will subside onto the plaintiff's property; 
       
      (b) there is no effective retention of the defendant's land at the boundary with the plaintiff's property;  
       
      (c) the cost of retaining the defendant's land to prevent further subsidence onto the plaintiff's property is materially less than the value of the plaintiff's land (there being some evidence that the plaintiff's property is worth over $1 million); 
       
      (d) therefore it is reasonable that steps be taken so that the soil on the defendant's land is properly retained; and 
       
      (e) by some means and by some person, an effective mode of retention must be provided. 
       
      
    103 The defendant submitted that the plaintiff had not discharged her burden of adducing clear evidence of the extent of the risk of future damage. I agree that the evidence is not overwhelmingly clear, but there is enough in the plaintiff's case to demonstrate, as I have found, that if the material now lying on the plaintiff's property is removed there will be a real risk that substantial quantities of earth and other material will fall from the defendant's to the plaintiff's land, either gradually or by landslip, and so it is necessary for the defendant's land to be artificially supported in order to avoid that risk.  
     
      
    104 However, it does not necessarily follow from the plaintiff's propositions that the defendant should bear the responsibility for solving the problem. Nor does it follow that the problem should be solved by curial intervention, as opposed to co-operation of the landowners, or perhaps some form of self-help, or administrative intervention by Woollahra Council pursuant to its powers under s 121B of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW). The plaintiff makes her case for curial intervention by relying on Leakey's case. 
     
      
    105 I agree with the plaintiff that the principle in Leakey's case is not confined to damages for past wrongdoing. The case supports the proposition that a landowner in occupation of his land has a duty, when he is aware or ought to be aware of a hazardous condition on the land which puts the neighbouring land at risk, to take such steps as are reasonable in all the circumstances to prevent or minimise the risk of injury or damage to the neighbour's property. In an appropriate case, the duty may be enforced by a mandatory quia timet injunction, available on general equitable principles.  
     
      
    106 The defendant purported to distinguish Leakey's case partly on the ground that Leakey does not concern future loss in the law of nuisance. The defendant pointed out that a mandatory quia timet injunction was refused by the trial judge ([1978] QB 849) and there was no appeal from that refusal. However, it was relevant to the trial judge's decision that by the time of the final hearing, an interlocutory injunction of a mandatory character had been granted and complied with by the National Trust: see [1980] 1 QB 485, 511. There is no reason to believe that their Lordships intended to recognise a duty to prevent or minimise the risk of injury in the stated circumstances, but to prevent specific enforcement of the duty. Given that interlocutory specific relief was ordered and there was no criticism of that order in the Court of Appeal, Leakey's case supports the view that injunctive relief is available to vindicate the duty, provided of course that equitable discretionary considerations favour the granting of such relief in the instant case. 
     
      
    107 In my opinion, however, the principle in Leakey's case does not lead to the conclusion that in the present case, the defendant has a duty to take all necessary steps at its own expense to retain its land, after the collapse of the retaining wall. There is an analogy with Leakey's case, in that in the present case the defendant's land now overhangs the plaintiff's land and there is a real risk of slippage and consequently further damage to the plaintiff. But the present state of affairs has arisen because of the collapse of the retaining wall, which retained the defendant's land adequately for the whole of the time that the defendant and the plaintiff had been owners and occupiers of their respective properties, until August 1998. The retaining wall was not, as I have said, wholly on the defendant's land. It benefited the defendant by retaining the defendant's soil, and it benefited the plaintiff by maximising the plaintiff's use of her land and protecting the plaintiff from landslip. The problem has arisen because the wall is no longer there to confer these mutual benefits. 
     
      
    108 These considerations suggest that while the defendant has a relevant duty under the Leakey principle, it is not a duty to replace the retaining wall or otherwise retain its land wholly at its own expense. As Megaw LJ said (at 524) in the passage quoted above, it is a duty to do that which is reasonable in the circumstances, and no more or less than that. Citing a passage from the Privy Council's advice in Goldman v Hargrave, his Lordship contemplated (525) that where the hazard arises on a small parcel of land, threatening a neighbour with substantial interests, the owner of the small property should not have to do so much as one with larger interests of his own at stake and greater resources to protect them: if the small owner does what he can and promptly calls on his neighbour to provide additional resources, he may be held to have done his duty. In my opinion those observations, while not directly applicable to the present case, suggest that in an appropriate case the landowner's duty may be to contribute to the cost of remedial work, rather than to pay the whole of the cost. In my opinion this is such case. Here the defendant's duty with respect to the risk of further landslip might be discharged by contributing an appropriate portion to the cost of remedial work, and by allowing access to contractors so that the work can be carried out. 
     
      
    109 Therefore, in my view the plaintiff is not entitled to the mandatory quia timet injunction that she seeks, because the defendant has no duty to carry out the whole of the remedial work alone. Even if the law as stated in Leakey's case required me to recognise such a duty, I would decline for discretionary reasons to make the mandatory order that the plaintiff seeks. The leading authority on final mandatory injunctions is Redland Bricks Ltd v Morris [1970] AC 652 (cf Lawlor v Johnston [1905] VLR 714). The Redland Bricks case indicates that the granting of a mandatory injunction is always a discretionary matter (at 655 for Lord Upjohn). 
     
      
    110 Dr IC F Spry, Equitable Remedies (5th ed, pp 539 and 540) describes the general discretionary considerations in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… on applications for mandatory injunctions it sometimes appears that the making of an order against the defendant will cause him very great expense or inconvenience and that matters of this nature may be of considerable weight in inducing the court to confine the plaintiff to damages, in accordance with the general equitable principles in reference to which the balance of justice is determined."" 
         
        ""… it must appear that in all the circumstances, and particularly in view of equitable considerations such as laches and hardship and inconvenience as between the parties, that the most just course is that the particular injunction that is sought should be granted."" 
        
       
      
    111 The defendant contends that the court would not make a mandatory order because the parties are obliged to comply with notices issued by Woollahra Council. I am not persuaded that the existence of orders by the Council should itself prevent the court from issuing an injunction in an appropriate case. Nor am I persuaded by the defendant's submissions that the anticipated harm to the plaintiff may not eventuate as forecast and if it does, it may be far less grave than forecast. The plaintiff's use of her property, including the reinstatement of the cottage to produce an economic return, is likely to be seriously impeded unless remedial work is carried out.  
     
      
    112 However, there is another powerful consideration pointing against my making a mandatory order to compel the defendant to carry out remedial work wholly at its expense. To make a mandatory order in the present case would be to commit the defendant to very substantial expenditure which would disproportionately enrich the plaintiff. The old and substandard wall would, of necessity, be replaced by modern and effective retention works. Although there is no direct evidence on the point, it is plausible to infer that the value of the plaintiff's property would be enhanced by that work, at no cost to her. That consideration, in its context in the present case, would probably have led me to decline specific relief.  
     
      
    113 I have not been asked to make any order reflecting the defendant's duty to contribute an appropriate part of the cost of remedial work. Nor have I been asked to determine what an appropriate contribution would be. It seems to me desirable that I should express an opinion on the latter question, although it is not directly before me at this stage, because my doing so may assist the parties to reach a sensible resolution of their dispute, at long last. In my view it is unlikely that anything would be gained by making provision for further submissions on the subject, and it is highly unlikely that there is any relevant evidence, not presently before me, that would assist me on this matter. Therefore, bearing in mind that the defendant offered to pay half the cost of the preliminary remedial work and weighing up all the circumstances, I express the opinion that the defendant would have no duty to contribute more than one half of the reasonable total cost of remedial works. 
     
      
    Damages for nuisance and negligence 
     
      
    114 The plaintiff accepted at the hearing that if the retaining wall failed solely because of the hydrostatic pressure produced by the rain, she cannot recover damages from the defendant for losses consequent upon the failure of the wall. In my opinion that is correct. Leakey's case is distinguishable because there is nothing in the evidence in the present case to suggest that the defendant knew or ought to have known that the plaintiff and her property were at risk of injury or damage through the collapse of the wall caused by heavy rain, and therefore it cannot be said that the defendant had any duty to take steps to prevent or minimise that risk.  
     
      
    115 The plaintiff submits that to recover damages for losses sustained in consequence of failure of the retaining wall, she must show that a material contributing cause of the failure of the wall was some unreasonable act or failure to act (""culpable conduct"") on the part of the defendant. The plaintiff submits that it was not necessary to prove that the culpable conduct was the only cause or even the dominant cause of the loss, provided she proves that it was a material contributing cause of the loss. For those propositions counsel for the plaintiff relies on Goldman v Hargrave in the High Court, especially the judgment of Windeyer J, and Morgan v Lake Macquarie City Council, in which Clarke JA applied Windeyer J's judgment. The defendant submits that the plaintiff's formulation is incorrect in law. The law requires, in the defendant's submission, that the court must approach causation ""by applying common sense to the facts of the case"" (March v Stramare (1991) 171 CLR 706, at 509, 515 per Mason CJ, 523 per Deane J), and that the less demanding ""but for"" test is not the exclusive test of causation (Chapel v Hart (1998) 195 CLR 232, at 244 per McHugh J (dissenting on the facts)).  
     
      
    116 I agree with the defendant's careful submissions on causation, though I am not sure that the plaintiff's formulation is inconsistent with them. It is open to a court applying the March v Stramare test to hold that causation is established where the defendant's conduct materially contributed to the plaintiff's loss, even though there were other factors at work, provided that common sense supports this conclusion. However, on the view I take of the facts, it is unnecessary for me to decide whether there is any difference between the plaintiff's and defendant's formulations of the test of causation, and if there is, which is to be preferred.  
     
      
    117 The plaintiff's case against the defendant is as follows: 
     
      
      (a) to place fill material on steeply sloping ground above her land and in relative proximity to the retaining wall was an inherently potentially dangerous (and therefore hazardous) activity; 
       
      (b) therefore, to justify placing fill material on steeply sloping ground above her land and in relatively close proximity to the retaining wall required the defendant to take all reasonable care to ensure that such activity was undertaken safely; 
       
      (c) all reasonable care in this context required both care at the time the fill was placed and care thereafter to ensure that the fill, if safely and securely placed initially, remained safely and securely placed thereafter; 
       
      (d) the defendant did not take all reasonable care to ensure that the fill material was placed safely and securely in 1961; 
       
      (e) the defendant did not take all reasonable care to ensure that the fill material remained safely and securely placed after 1961; and 
       
      (f) the fill material was a contributing cause to the failure of the retaining wall. 
       
      
    118 In light of the findings of fact that I have made, the plaintiff's case falls down in three respects. First, the fill material added to the lateral forces on the wall only to a minor or negligible extent; secondly, by employing competent contractors to carry out the construction of the car park and associated works, and relying on their designs and advice, the defendant discharged its duty of care in 1961; and thirdly, the removal of trees from the defendant's land did not contribute to the collapse of the wall or constitute a failure to ensure that the fill material remained safe and secure. 
     
      
    Findings as to defences 
     
      
    119 Since, in my view, the plaintiff has not made out her case in private nuisance or negligence, it is not strictly necessary for me to deal with the defences. However, my findings of fact imply conclusions which I shall set out for the sake of clarity.  
     
      
    120 It follows from my findings of fact that, in my view, the deposit by the defendant of fill material at the time of construction of the car park, and its subsequent use of the land between the car park and retaining wall, constituted a reasonable user of the land for the purposes of the law of nuisance. 
     
      
    121 In my view, nothing in the evidence supports the contention that the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of the wall failing. There is no evidence that she had any appreciation of the inadequate design of the wall, and therefore no evidence that she had the requisite knowledge of the risk. Knowledge, probably actual knowledge, is a precondition to any agreement to accept the risk: Insurance Commissioner v Joyce (1948) 77 CLR 39, 57. 
     
      
    122 The defendant has not discharged its onus of proof of contributory negligence. I have found that there is no evidence that she observed any bowing or other deficiency in the wall (or, indeed, that there was any observable deficiency apart from some lime dusting when the wall was dry), and that she did what she reasonably could be expected to do in cleaning the weep holes. 
     
      
    123 As to the contention that the plaintiff failed to mitigate her loss by taking more active steps to safeguard the remnants of the cottage from further damage by the elements, the evidence of Mr Barros, and also the evidence of Mr Knox in cross-examination, is to the effect that the cottage was so damaged as to be beyond even partial salvage and reinstatement, and needed to be demolished. Mr Pilz expressed a contrary view. Regardless of whether part of the cottage could have been salvaged, the fact is that at the relevant time the plaintiff received apparently competent advice that the correct option was demolition, and it was not unreasonable for her to accept that advice and act on it. That being so, she had no duty to protect the remnants of the cottage from the elements. 
     
      
    The cross-claim 
     
      
    124 As I have explained, the cross-claim is grounded in negligence, nuisance and the law of easements. 
     
      
    125 As to negligence, the defendant refers to s 177 (1), (2) and (9) of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW). I should also note s 177 (11), invoked by the plaintiff. Those provisions are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) For the purposes of the common law of negligence, a duty of care exists in relation to the right of support for land. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Accordingly, a person has a duty of care not to do anything on or in relation to land (the  
        supporting land 
        ) that removes the support provided by the supporting land to any other land (the  
        supported land 
        ). 
        
       
       
        
        (9) Any action in negligence that is commenced after the commencement of this section in relation to the removal of the support provided by supporting land to supported land may be wholly or partly based on something that was done before the commencement of this section. However, this subsection does not operate to extend any period of limitation under the Limitation Act 1969. 
        
       
       
        
        (11) This section does not apply in relation to any proceedings that were commenced before the commencement of this section."" 
        
       
      
    126 The section was intended to remove doubt as to the existence of a duty of care in relation to the maintenance of lateral support of a neighbour's land. The effect of the section is to remove from consideration of the negligence claim, the highly artificial rules in nuisance which had developed out of the decision of the House of Lords in Dalton v Henry Angus & Co  (1881) 6 App Cas 740: as to the old rules, see Kebewar Pty Ltd v Harkin (1987) 9 NSWLR 738, 741. In nuisance, a defendant's omission to maintain lateral support was not sufficient to establish liability. However, on ordinary principles of negligence, a defendant has an obligation to take reasonable care to prevent or reduce foreseeable injury caused by failure to maintain lateral support. 
     
      
    127 As counsel for the plaintiff has pointed out, the present proceeding commenced before the commencement of s 177. Strictly, therefore, the section does not apply. But the defendant says that the section reflects the preponderant view of lawyers before its enactment, and was only intended to remove doubt as to the correctness of that view. To resolve this issue, it would be necessary for me to decide whether the pervasive influence of the law of negligence had, before the commencement of s 177, asphyxiated yet another brace of older and more artificial rules, just as it has in so many other areas.  
     
      
    128 However, in my opinion it is unnecessary to make a decision on that point in the present case, because the facts do not support the defendant's claim in any event. 
     
      
    129 Any duty of care would depend upon the establishment of foreseeable injury, and therefore that the plaintiff was aware or ought to have been aware of the risk that the wall would collapse. I have found that the evidence does not support any such findings. 
     
      
    130 The cross-claim also relies on nuisance, seeking to turn Leakey's case (along with the Sedleigh-Denfield case and Goldman v Hargrave) against the plaintiff. However, it cannot be said, in view of my findings of fact, that the plaintiff failed to discharge any duty she may have had to take the steps reasonable in the circumstances to prevent or minimise the risk that the wall would collapse. 
     
      
    131 The third ground advanced in the cross-claim is that the defendant had an easement for support and that the plaintiff breached her obligations under the easement. The easement for support is said to have arisen by prescription, under the rule of the ""lost modern grant"". This raises two issues: first, whether such an easement by prescription may arise where title to the land in question is, as in the present case, held under the Real Property Act; and secondly, if the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, whether such an easement has arisen on the facts of the present case. 
     
      
    132 I regard the first of these two issues as the more difficult and uncertain. The defendant says that there is no direct or binding authority as to whether easements by prescription arising under the doctrine of lost modern grant are affected by the Real Property Act, noting that s 45C does not exclude such easements. The defendant refers to Delohery v Permanent Trustee Co of New South Wales (1904) 1 CLR 283, where Griffith CJ indicated in obiter dicta that the doctrine applied to Torrens land in New South Wales. In Dobbie v Davidson (1991) 23 NSWLR 625, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales held that there was no reason why a prescriptive easement acquired over land prior to its being brought under the Real Property Act should be extinguished by the issue of a certificate of title - but that is, of course, another case. 
     
      
    133 The plaintiff claims, categorically, that an easement affecting land, title to which is held under the Real Property Act, cannot be acquired by prescription, citing Australian Hi-If Publications Pty Ltd v Gel [1979] 2 NSWLR 618,622, and Kostos v Devitt [1979] ACLD 516. 
     
      
    134 In my opinion the cases relied upon by the plaintiff cannot support the categorical proposition which she asserts. I regard the question as an open one on the authorities. However, it is unnecessary for me to make a decision in this case because, in my view, if a right of support can arise by prescription in respect of Torrens title land, the requirements for such a right to arise are not satisfied here, for two reasons. First, since according to my findings the boundary between the plaintiff's and defendant's land ran through the retaining wall, so that the eastern face of the retaining wall was the property of the defendant, there was no actual support derived by the soil of the defendant's land from the plaintiff's land. The plaintiff believed, reasonably (see Anthony v Commonwealth (1973) 47 AJLR 83, 91), that the retaining wall was erected over the boundary so that part of it was the defendant's property. In such a case, the exercise of a right of support is not ""open"" (Richardson v Browning (1936) 31 Tas LR 78), and therefore no right of support could be acquired by the defendant against the plaintiff by prescription (Milne v James (1910) 13 CLR 168,178). 
     
      
    135 Moreover, it was not possible for the plaintiff to prevent the defendant from obtaining support from the retaining wall without unreasonable waste of labour and expense (Webb v Bird (1861) 10 CB (NS) 268, 238 [142 ER 455, 461]), for to do so would have involved demolishing the wall and so causing serious injury to the plaintiff's own property (Union Lighterage Co v London Graving Dock Co [1902] 2 Ch 557, 568). For this reason, too, the defendant cannot derive a right of support by prescription. 
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    136 The plaintiff has failed to make out any entitlement to relief (other than perhaps with respect to costs) on the grounds advanced in her further amended statement of claim. The defendant has failed to make out any of the claims for relief in its cross-claim (other than perhaps with respect to costs). I therefore intend in due course to dismiss the proceeding and the cross-claim, except with respect to costs, and arrange a time to hear submissions on costs.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a crown appeal from the alleged inadequacy of the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Naughton QC on 1 November 2001. The Respondent pleaded guilty to one charge of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and another count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to the same section. Two comparatively minor matters were taken into account on a Form 1, but would have had little impact on the sentences. His Honour sentenced the Appellant to imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of four years on the first count and to a fixed term of four years for the second count. 
      
       
     2 On 5 April 2001, the Respondent was driving a car which he knew to have been stolen. In that car was his de facto wife, Tammy Francis and their two year old daughter. They travelled to a methadone clinic in Kogarah. After obtaining the methadone, they offered a lift to David Kristian and his girlfriend, Kelly Ton. In the accident, to which I will refer below, David Kristian died. This was the death referred to in count 1. Kelly Ton was injured. This was the grievous bodily harm referred to in count 2. 
      
       
     3 At about 11.33am while driving a friend's car, the owner of the stolen car saw his car being driven in Allawah. He followed it and noticed it pull into a service station in Hurstville. Miss Francis and her daughter left the car. Two police vehicles, responding to the owner's report, entered the service station. One was parked across the front of the stolen car. A uniformed police officer, Constable Rebecca Callas, reached in and grabbed the offender by the upper arm or shoulder and told him to get out of the car. He said something like, ""Get fucked"" or ""Fuck off"". He drove the stolen vehicle forward, wrenching himself free of the police officer's grip. He drove around the police vehicle which was attempting to block his exit and took off at high speed.  
      
       
     4 A police chase ensued, also at high speed. It lasted for about fourteen minutes through suburban streets, which his Honour found were moderately to heavily trafficked. The offender's speed reached well over 100 kilometres per hour. The offender was seen to weave at high speed around other vehicles, one of which he narrowly missed. Pursuing police vehicles had their emergency sirens and flashing lights in operation. 
      
       
     5 The accident occurred at the intersection of King Georges Road and Forest Road, Hurstville. Travelling south along King Georges Road the offender went through a red light at the intersection and hit the front corner of a cement truck which was travelling north along King Georges Road and was making a right hand turn across the path of the offender's vehicle, in accordance with a green arrow permitting a turn of that kind. 
      
       
     6 The stolen car sideslipped towards a raised traffic island that divided Forest Road in two sections at its intersection with King Georges Road. The passenger side of the car collided with a Toyota Land Cruiser that was standing stationary in Forest Road facing west, waiting to turn into King Georges Road. The stolen car then mounted the traffic island, the front passenger side hit a traffic light pole on the traffic island and bent it. The car then careered off the traffic island across the eastern turning lane of Forest Road and straight into a street light pole near the road edge on the eastern side of that lane. The car then came to a stop. 
      
       
     7 The driver of the cement truck estimated that when the stolen car collided with his truck, it was travelling at about 130 to 140 kilometres per hour. His Honour accepted this estimate. 
      
       
     8 The accident happened at about 11.53am. The police pursuit of the stolen car began at 11.39am. This, accordingly, lasted, as I have said, about fourteen minutes. It was the circumstance of the police pursuit that made each of the offences the aggravated form of the offence pursuant to section 52A(7)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the first count was fourteen years imprisonment and for the second count was eleven years imprisonment. 
      
       
     9 The passenger victim, David Kristian, died from the multiple serious injuries sustained in the accident. He was aged twenty-four. The passenger victim, Kelly Ton, was twenty-one. She spent three weeks in hospital as a result of the injuries that she sustained, which included a broken collar bone, two broken ribs and tears to her liver and lungs. She also suffered lacerations to her head and right leg and had stitches inserted in her leg wound. 
      
       
     10 The offender also suffered serious injury in the accident, including collapsed lungs, a broken sternum and broken ribs. 
      
       
     11 His Honour correctly described the criminal history of the Respondent as ""appalling"". The offender was thirty-seven at the time of the accident. His criminal history began in 1981 when he was seventeen. He was then convicted for malicious injury to property and abusing police. Subsequently, his record comprises many driving offences, including driving with more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol, driving in a manner dangerous to other persons, negligent driving, driving while disqualified and driving an uninsured vehicle. He also had convictions for car theft, firearms offences, assaults, including on police, escape from lawful custody, possession of drugs, goods in custody, stealing and possessing housebreaking implements. He has served a number of terms of imprisonment. In April 2001 he was declared a habitual offender. At the time of the offences presently under consideration, he was then a disqualified driver with a period of disqualification at least until 12 December 2010. As his Honour concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “The offender has demonstrated a persistently defiant attitude towards obedience of the law.” 
         
        
       
     12 His Honour took into account the pleas of guilty. He did not, however, regard them as a manifestation of contrition or remorse. Indeed, his Honour specifically rejected a submission that there was any evidence of contrition or remorse. The plea was ""simply an acceptance by the offender of the inevitable"". His Honour did, however, say that he accepted the plea as having a ""significant utilitarian value"". This was in accordance with the longstanding acceptance of the fact that utilitarian value was a material consideration. (See, for example, the four judge joint judgment of the High Court in Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656 at [22].) This principle has been applied in numerous authorities, including in this Court's guideline judgment on the subject of pleas of guilty in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 see, for example, at [4]. 
      
       
     13 In view of the recent decision in Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6 at [14] this approach has now, apparently, been disapproved, although s22(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 may be a distinguishing feature for the applicability of Cameron v The Queen in this State. 
      
       
     14 In any event, the majority of the High Court in Cameron accepted that a preparedness to assist the administration of justice was a relevant consideration, albeit seen from the perspective of the offender rather than from the perspective of the State. 
      
       
     15 The Court is entitled to take into account the preparedness of an offender to assist the administration of justice. This, however, according to Cameron, must be seen from the perspective of the offender. On this new basis, it may be difficult to accept, in the circumstances of this case, that a discount, as much as 15 to 20 percent at the higher end of the range of Thomson and Houlton was appropriate. I am not prepared to act on any other basis. The Crown in this case at trial accepted that there was a utilitarian value and that the plea had been made at the earliest opportunity. Accordingly, for the purposes of any resentencing, I propose to approach this case on the basis that a discount for the value of the plea high in the range of Thomson and Houlton would continue to be appropriate. 
      
       
     16 The size of any discount must still be considered in the light of the ultimate sentence and whether that sentence was, in accordance with the submissions of the Crown, manifestly inadequate. That is the basic issue before the Court. There are well-known restrictions on this Court interfering with the exercise of the sentencing discretion on this basis. Nevertheless, there are occasions on which it is appropriate to do so.  
      
       
     17 His Honour did not understate the objective gravity of the offences, the question is whether or not he failed to give that objective gravity sufficient weight in the outcome. 
      
       
     18 His Honour made reference to the personal and subjective circumstances of the offender, including the difficulties of his childhood associated with his father's heavy drinking and aggressive behaviour towards him and other family members. The offender left home at the age of eighteen to avoid, his Honour accepted, the continued abuse by his father. At an early age he developed a problem with drugs, which moved from cigarettes to marijuana, to amphetamines and, eventually, to heroin. His Honour noted that the Respondent spent something in the order of seven years of his adult life in prison. The offender did not have the benefit of family support, but had some bonding with his de facto wife and new daughter, and with a 15 year old son from an earlier de facto relationship. 
      
       
     19 His Honour accepted the report of a psychologist that the offender was gaining insight into his offending behaviour, but that, in the absence of professional intervention, he may still present a risk to others. These are matters which his Honour eventually took into account as constituting ""special circumstances"" entitling him to vary the usual relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period. 
      
       
     20 The report of the psychologist recites, as is usual, what was reported to the professional by the Respondent. Psychologists and other experts do not set themselves up in any way as assessing the truth of what is said to them. They report, and in most cases, act on the basis of what is said to them. Nevertheless, in this case, the prospects for rehabilitation as considered by the consultant psychologist were, to say the least, not over-stated. Indeed, a proper understanding of the report is that the Respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation are poor, given his history. The psychologist set out a number of risk factors for further offending which are substantial. She noted a number of matters that outline the prospect of successful rehabilitation. There appears to be some realisation of a need to change his ways. There seems to be some support for such a change from the limited family support that he has, particularly from his partner and child.  
      
       
     21 Nevertheless, the psychologist concluded that, in the absence of professional intervention to address his propensity to find in his antisocial behaviour a source of comfort and self-worth, ""he may still present a risk to others"". There is little support in what the psychologist said for any substantial degree of hope that the propensity would be overcome by such intervention. 
      
       
     22 Nothing in his Honour's remarks on sentence, as I have said, suggested that his Honour understated the objective gravity of the offences. His Honour referred to the need for ""a firm element of general and specific deterrence"" and to a need for the sentences to ""reflect appropriate public denunciation and punishment"". His Honour concluded that the objective seriousness of the offences ""significantly outweighs the subjective factors personal to the offender"". This is manifestly the case. The subjective case advanced on the part of the respondent was not a strong one. 
      
       
     23 Matters of aggravation of the offence included the fact that the Respondent was driving whilst disqualified; that he was using a stolen vehicle; his excessive speed; his long criminal history; the fact that there were multiple victims (including himself) and the recklessness involving a serious risk to many other innocent people, including the police, occasioned by a long period of erratic and dangerous driving. His Honour, I should note, specifically acknowledged the family tragedy outlined in the victim impact statements of the deceased's mother and father, referring to their feelings of horror, deprivation and anger. 
      
       
     24 The Crown submitted that this case was in the worst category of cases and that, indeed, it could attract the maximum penalty for which the law provides. It is unnecessary to attempt to analyse what may be the worst category of cases. As previous authorities have said, it is always possible to conceive of something worse. However, there is no doubt that the objective circumstances were amongst the worse that one could imagine.  
      
       
     25 The motivation for the action, which was the attempt to evade the police from apprehending him, in circumstances where the nature of the offence appeared to be stealing a vehicle, was, of course, what made the offence the aggravated version of the offence, for which the section provides. 
      
       
     26 The conduct of evading the police, escaping from an attempt to physically restrain him and driving around a second car which was attempting to block his path indicates the deliberate conduct in which he had engaged. But, more significant, is the fourteen minutes of aggressive driving on moderately to heavily trafficked suburban roads with at least one near miss, deliberately putting numerous members of the public at substantial risk. 
      
       
     27 It was only fortuitous that there was not in the car with him both his wife and daughter. If they had been in the car with him, they would have been, as I understand it, in the front seat, and would have suffered horrendous injuries and may very well have died. It was fortuitous that this did not happen. Furthermore, he happened to crash into a concrete truck at the speed of 130 to 140 kilometres per hour, as his Honour has found. Going through a red light, it was quite fortuitous it was a concrete truck and not something else. People in an ordinary car or cars would unquestionably have been injured and may well have died. This reinforces the gravity of his conduct in putting people at risk by taking deliberate steps to drive around a police vehicle and then for fourteen minutes, evade the police by weaving into and out of traffic at excessive speed and eventually running through a red light.  
      
       
     28 All of this indicates that the known gravity of the offence was extremely high. Nothing in the subjective case presented to this Court is such as to reduce in any substantial way the appropriate penalty that ought to be imposed. 
      
       
     29 This Court should only intervene in such circumstances in a case where the sentence below was manifestly inadequate and, when it does so, the principles, often referred to as the principles of double jeopardy, suggest that the sentence this Court imposes, in lieu of the sentence it is quashing, should be the least sentence that could reasonably be imposed in all of the circumstances of the case. 
      
       
     30 In the present case I believe that a significant increase is warranted and that his Honour imposed a sentence that was manifestly inadequate. The sentencing discretion must be re-exercised. 
      
       
     31 I do not reach the same conclusion as his Honour that this is a case in which there are special circumstances justifying a variation of the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period. In the event, on the orders I propose, there will be a two year non-parole period. There is no warrant to increase that to, say, three years in circumstances where there is nothing before the Court that indicates that the difference between two and three years would be of any substantial assistance. 
      
       
     32 The psychologist’s report tendered in this case suggests that with some assistance the offender may be able to change his habitual course of offending. There is no reason to suggest that three years is required rather than two years in these circumstances. The thrust of the report is that it is really a question for the offender himself to make up his mind to change his ways. If he does that then, with some professional assistance, he will be able to achieve the desired result. If he does not do it and does not cure his addiction, then he will not. There does not appear to be any difference between two and three years, in that respect. 
      
       
     33 In my opinion, this Court should quash the orders below. In the circumstances of this case, but for the plea of guilty, I would have concluded that for the charge of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death, a period of ten years imprisonment would have been appropriate, but by reason of the plea of guilty, it should be reduced to eight years. The non-parole period should be in accordance with the statutory ratio i.e. six years. 
      
       
     34 With respect to the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, no particular objection was taken to the imposition of a four year fixed term. I do not regard that as inappropriate and I do not propose to disturb that particular sentence. 
      
       
     35 Accordingly, the orders I propose are that the appeal be allowed, that the sentence for the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death be quashed and in lieu thereof the Respondent be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight years, commencing on 5 April 2001 and expiring on 4 April 2009. A non-parole period should be set at six years commencing on 5 April 2001 and expiring on 4 April 2007. 
      
       
     36 I add that the earliest date on which he is eligible to be released for parole is 4 April 2007.

        REGINA v GLEN LAWRENCE MACDONNELL 
        
       
      
      
       
       Between 1997 and 1998, police officers conducted a covert investigation into the suspected drug activities of the respondent and his nephew. A large quantity of Heroin, Methylamphetamine and Cocaine was seized. His Honour concluded that the respondent was a substantial dealer, whereas his nephew played a limited role. The respondent initially pleaded not guilty to all charges laid against him, but changed his plea during the trial, pleading guilty to the charges of supply not less than large commercial quantity of heroin, supply not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, and supply of cocaine. 
       
      
      
       
       The maximum penalty for the respondent’s offences is a fine of 5000 penalty units, life imprisonment or both. On 23 Aug 2001, sentence was passed in the following terms: 
        
       1 Supply not less than large commercial quantity of heroin: imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. 
        
       2 Supply not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine: Imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. 
        
       3 Supply cocaine: Imprisonment for 2 years. 
        
       The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently because his honour held that each offence was part of one continuous exercise. The effective overall sentence was 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. This sentence incorporated a discount of 25% for the respondent’s plea of guilty. The crown now appeals the leniency of the sentence. 
       
      
      
       
       Held: 
        (Allowing the appeal on all grounds): 
       
      
      
       
       Ground 1: The sentence was manifestly inadequate  
        
       The role of the offender is more important than the quantity of drugs when sentencing drug offenders. This is subject to the fact that supply offences under state law have an increased penalty as the quantity of drug moves to the level that answers a description of a commercial, or large commercial quantity. When proper attention is given to the need for consistent sentences to those who are significantly involved in the supply chain of drugs such as heroin and amphetamines, then the conclusion is that there must have been a misapplication of principle.

       The respondent should have received a modest discount in the order of 10% for his displayed willingness to facilitate the course of justice. This is because the pleas of guilty were made over three years after the respondent was arrested, they came after a jury had been empanelled, and they directly followed a ruling made by the trial judge in relation to the admissibility of evidence that was adverse to the respondent. The case was not one where the first reasonable opportunity to plead depended on that ruling.

       Ground 3: The sentence adjustment made by reference to the respondent’s assistance, led to a non-parole period which was unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence 
       
      
      
       
       The sentence imposed, particularly the non-parole component, was disproportionate to the objective criminality involved. The respondent is entitled to have the court take into account the assistance he gave to the authorities, and it is also proper to take it into account as a special circumstance. However, it was erroneous to apply the discount for assistance wholly to the non-parole period. The approach taken was likely to skew the whole sentencing exercise, particularly after a large discount had been given for the pleas of guilty. The combined discount for the pleas of guilty and for the assistance should have been in the order of 40%.

       Ground 4: Error in directing that the sentences be served concurrently 
       
      
      
       
       The correct approach in determining whether sentences should be served concurrently is to first fix the appropriate sentence for each offence, and then to consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality. Here, his honour first ordered that the sentences be served concurrently, then determined the sentence for each offence. In any event, having regard to the duration of the criminality, the quantity of drugs in which the respondent dealt, and the fact that the charges relate to an extended period of time, not merely to the seizure of drugs made by the police on March 1998, the present case called for some accumulation of sentence, in order to reflect the criminality involved.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences imposed upon the respondent by his Honour Judge Woods QC in the District Court at Sydney on 23 August 2001. 
      
       
     2 On 30 April 2001 the respondent appeared for trial before his Honour and a jury. He was arraigned upon an indictment containing a charge of supply not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin, (in the alternative supply commercial quantity of heroin); a charge of supply not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, (in the alternative supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine); and a charge of supply cocaine. The respondent pleaded not guilty to each count. 
      
       
     3 In the absence of the jury, and before any evidence had been called, his Honour made a number of rulings in respect of the admissibility of certain listening device evidence. Following his Honour’s rulings on 3 May 2001 that the material was admissible, the respondent pleaded guilty to the two counts of supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (heroin and methylamphetamine respectively) and to the count of supplying cocaine.  
      
       
     4 The maximum penalty under s 33(3)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for each of the offences relating to the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, is a fine of 5000 penalty units or imprisonment for life, or both. S 32 of the same Act provides that the maximum penalty for the supply cocaine offence is a fine of 2000 penalty units, or imprisonment for a term of 15 years or both. 
      
       
     5 On 23 August 2001, his Honour passed sentence in the following terms: - 
      
       
        
         
         “Count 1:  
         SUPPLY NOT LESS THAN THE LARGE QUANTITY OF HEROIN 
          
          
         Imprisonment for a term of 9 years, commencing from 23 August 2001. A non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, to expire on 22 February 2006. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 3: SUPPLY NOT LESS THAN THE LARGE COMMERCIAL QUANTITY OF METHYLAMPHETAMINE 
         
        
        
         
         Imprisonment for a term of 7 years and 6 months, commencing from 23 August 2001. Non-parole period of 4 years, to expire on 22 August 2005. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 5: SUPPLY COCAINE 
         
        
        
         
         Imprisonment for a term of 2 years, commencing from 23 August 2001 
         .” 
         
        
        
       
     6 It is necessary to add, in relation to the ultimate sentencing order made, that initially the sentence imposed for the heroin offence had been one of nine years, with a non-parole period of six years, while that for the methylamphetamine offence had been one of seven and a half years, with a non-parole period of five years.  
      
       
     7 After it was drawn to the attention of his Honour that he may have overlooked certain material, provided on a confidential basis, which was of relevance pursuant to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour reduced the respective non-parole periods for the two offences to four and a half years, and four years respectively. The head sentences were not altered. The effective overall sentence, by reason of the fact that the sentences were directed to be served concurrently, was accordingly one of nine years, with a non-parole period of four and a half years.  
      
       
        
       FACTS 
        
       
     8 Between September 1997 and 9 March 1998, police officers attached to Operation Canfield conducted a covert investigation into the suspected drug activities of the respondent and a co-offender, the respondent’s nephew Kieron MacDonnell. During the course of the operation it became apparent that both men were regularly visiting a flat at Croydon Park, which was leased by a seventy four year old woman named Doris Curtis. 
      
       
     9 On 9 March 1998, the respondent was arrested, and police executed a search warrant at the flat. There they located a number of bags containing drugs, which were tested and found to comprise:  
      
       
        
         
         “HEROIN 
          
         3164.9 grams, 83% purity, street value $6,156,970.00 
         
        
        
         
         METHYLAMPHETAMINE 
          
         9032.2 grams, above average purity, street value $1,432,890.00 
         
        
        
         
         COCAINE 
          
         63.8 grams, street value $21,673.00” 
         
        
       
     10 The large commercial quantity for both heroin and methylamphetamine is 1kg, a quantity which, in each instance, was well exceeded. Moreover, of significance in the present case was the fact that the heroin and methylamphetamine were of considerable purity. 
      
       
     11 Ms Curtis initially denied any knowledge of the drugs, but later provided a number of induced statements outlining her knowledge of the respondent’s activities, which were consistent only with extensive and long standing dealings in drugs on his part. She was granted an immunity, and gave evidence at the committal proceedings against the respondent and his nephew, by which time she was aged 75 years.  
      
       
     12 His Honour found that in order to avoid detection, the respondent and his nephew had procured the use of her flat to store the drugs. It was apparent from the evidence, as found by his Honour, that she was being paid money for the use of her premises, and that she had supplied the respondent with keys to them. Surveillance showed the respondent or his nephew, or both of them, going to the premises from time to time, and collecting drugs, which were then offered for sale on the street. The premises, his Honour found, were “used for storing, breaking up and preparation for the on-supply of the drugs”. 
      
       
     13 Ms Curtis’ statement, a number of listening device transcripts, and a chronology of the police operation, were tendered as part of the Crown case on sentence, together with a number of analyst’s certificates and statements relating to the value of the drugs seized. His Honour found, by reference to this material, that the respondent was “substantially involved in the selling” of heroin and methylamphetamine, and possibly other drugs. The listening device material, his Honour said, was “damning of (the respondent). It clearly shows (him) actively supplying heroin and the methylamphetamine, it shows his involvement with various criminal associates with drugs, and it shows his active pursuit of drug deals”.  
      
       
     14 In summary, his Honour drew the conclusion that the respondent was “in relation the heroin and the cocaine (sic) [presumably a slip of the tongue for methylamphetamine] a substantial dealer consistent with his possession and control with associates of large commercial quantities of heroin and methylamphetamine.” In addition, his Honour said “as to the cocaine, I have no doubt that he himself had a habit and used it, and that in part his drug dealing in heroin and methylamphetamine was aimed at financing his own drug habit.”  
      
       
     15 It is apparent from these findings that his Honour accepted that the drugs seized during the search were merely part and parcel of an ongoing activity or venture for the supply of the drugs in question. Accordingly, it is not the case that the offences charged and proved by the pleas of guilty, were confined to charges of deemed supply referable merely to the quantities of drugs found by the police. 
      
       
     16 On 20 October 2000, Judge Woods sentenced Kieron MacDonnell, after he had pleaded guilty to one count of supplying heroin simpliciter, that is, without reference to the aggravating circumstances involved where the offence was one of supply in a commercial or large commercial quantity. In the course of the remarks on sentence his Honour referred to the basis upon which Kieron MacDonnell had been sentenced in the following terms:  
      
       
        
         
         “… 
         I accept that Kieron MacDonnell played only a limited role in the operation. He was a driver for Glen MacDonnell. He tied elastic bands around plastic bags on occasions when Glen MacDonnell was breaking up larger heroin blocks, and he occasionally would assist Glen MacDonnell getting out an esky from the linen press where some drugs were kept. That Kieron MacDonnell was part of the operation was exemplified by the fact that he was paid money by Glenn on a regular basis. Precisely how much is not clear, but he was certainly a paid employee in the exercise. 
         ” 
          
         
        
       
     17 The sentence imposed upon him was one of imprisonment for two years and three months, with a non-parole period of one year. There has been no appeal by the Crown in relation to it.  
      
       
     18 His Honour expressly gave consideration to the question of parity noting that there were “powerful points of distinction” between the two offenders in that: 
      
       
        
       (a) The respondent was to be sentenced for three offences of supply, two of which involved a large commercial quantity; 
        
        
       (b) Kieron MacDonnell had no prior adult convictions, whereas the respondent had an extensive record, including a prior drug conviction; 
        
        
       (c) Kieron MacDonnell was in his early twenties, whereas the respondent was a mature man in his mid forties; and  
        
        
       (d) Kieron MacDonnell pleaded guilty at a much earlier point in the proceedings. 
        
       
     19 His Honour came to the conclusion, which appears to me to have been the only one properly open upon the evidence, that as between himself and his nephew, the respondent was the principal. His Honour added that this was not to say that others were not also involved, including in all probability, one other named person who may have supplied drugs to the respondent and to his nephew for on-sale.  
      
       
     20 As I understand his Honour’s findings, which would appear to me to be supported by the evidence, the respondent was significant in the distribution chain, being the recipient from others of substantial quantities of drugs, which he then packaged and prepared, preparatory for on-sale to consumers. The significance of his role in this regard, was indicated by the fact that he was dealing in substantial quantities of drugs and by the fact that they were of high purity, the expectation clearly being that they would be cut before finding their way eventually to end users. In my view his role was far more significant than that of a street dealer, or even of a lower level distributor. It was, no doubt, less than that of those who had arranged the importation of the drugs, or the manufacture of the methylamphetamine, if it was produced locally. However, whatever be the case in that regard, it remains clear that he was a significantly involved player in the commercial supply of the substances heroin, methylamphetamine and cocaine. 
      
       
        
        
        
       SUBJECTIVE FEATURES 
        
       
     21 A psychologist’s report, prepared by Ms Megan Macdonald, and a pre sentence report, were tendered. 
      
       
     22 These documents showed that the respondent had been born on 23 February 1954. He had a number of prior criminal convictions, the most significant being a charge of supplying heroin, which was dealt with in 1993, and in respect of which he had served a minimum term of eight months’ imprisonment. 
      
       
     23 The material also showed that he was the oldest in a family of seven siblings; that his parents had divorced when he was twelve years old; and that he had thereafter assumed a position of responsibility in the household. 
      
       
     24 The respondent, it was disclosed, had spent most of his working life involved in the harness racing industry as a professional form analyst and punter. He married at the age of forty one, and reported that he had become emotionally and financially burdened by the responsibility of providing for his family, which included two children. It was said that it was at this time that he became acquainted with others in the drug trade, and commenced drinking, and using cocaine. His Honour noted, correctly, that while the personal and financial pressures were regrettable and understandable, they did not provide any excuse for his criminality.  
      
       
     25 Positive character references were tendered, which painted him as a loving husband and father. This was a somewhat curious observation on the part of the persons who provided those references, since they were given in relation to a man who had become significantly involved in the drug trade, that being a trade which creates such pernicious risks for the young. His Honour however, accepted him to be a person who had a sincere concern for his own family, and who was not violent by disposition. 
      
       
     26 The psychologist reported that the respondent was 
      
       
        
         
          “suffering from a long standing severe clinical depression (with suicidal ideation) whose content at least partly refers to catastrophic, personal and material losses resulting from his criminal activities.” 
         
        
        
       His Honour appropriately noted that depression was to be expected in a person facing imprisonment for serious criminal misconduct. He went on to find however, that his depression had contributed to the lateness of his plea. That is a finding for which neither I nor counsel can find support, in the material placed before his Honour. It was not a finding properly open. 
        
        
       STRUCTURE OF THE SENTENCE 
        
       
     27 In sentencing the respondent, his Honour said that he intended to impose concurrent sentences  
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         because it seems to me that it is one continuous exercise which was being embarked upon by those involved, the drugs were different, but they were part of the one continuous exercise, and indeed in the evidence of the listening devices it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the heroin and the amphetamine.” 
         
        
       
     28 For the plea of guilty his Honour allowed a discount of 25%, finding that it involved contrition, and had a utilitarian benefit, and also finding, as I have already noted, that the respondent’s “mental state” would have contributed to the lateness of the plea. But for it, his Honour indicated, the sentence for the heroin offence would have been one of twelve years’ imprisonment. Upon the assumption that the same approach was taken in relation to the amphetamine offence, the starting point for it would presumably have been one in the order of ten years’ imprisonment. 
      
       
     29 Special circumstances were found, referable to the respondent’s need for rehabilitation and drug treatment; and presumably, although his Honour did not specifically say so, by reason of the assistance which he had initially overlooked. 
      
       
        
       THE APPEAL 
        
       
     30 The Crown submitted that his Honour fell into error in that:- 
      
       
        
       (a) the sentence did not adequately reflect the objective gravity of the offences for which the respondent was to be sentenced; 
        
        
       (b) the discount given for the plea was not one which was properly available upon the evidence; 
        
        
       (c) the adjustment which was made to the sentence by reference to the respondent’s assistance, led to a non-parole period which was unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences. 
        
        
       (d) the approach taken, in directing that the sentences be served concurrently, contravened the principle established by the decision of  
       Pearce v The Queen 
        (1998) 194 CLR 610; and 
        
       
     31 In my view, each of these submissions has been made good. 
      
       
        
       (A) MANIFEST INADEQUACY 
        
       
     32 In relation to manifest inadequacy it is to be accepted that appellate intervention is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from sentences imposed in other cases; or because it is less than that which the Court of Criminal Appeal would have itself imposed if sentencing at first instance. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ pointed out in Wong and Leung v The Queen (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons.” 
         
        
        
       See also  
       House v The King 
        (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505 and  
       Dinsdale v The Queen 
        (2000) 74 ALJR 1538. 
        
       
     33 It is also to be accepted that the mere quantity of the drugs is not the sole, or even the principal, determinant for sentencing in relation to drug offences. What is more important is the role of the offender, and the level of his or her participation in the offence; subject of course to the fact that, in relation to supply offences under State law, there is a gradation of seriousness reflected by an increase in penalty as the quantity of drug involved moves into those levels which answer the descriptions of a commercial quantity, or of a large commercial quantity. 
      
       
     34 What was important, in the present case, was that the heroin and the amphetamine offences did not relate solely to the drugs found at the time of the search, which, in any event, themselves had a street value in the order of $7.6 million. They related to offences of supply over at least the period covered by the listening device tapes; and, upon the basis of Ms Curtis’ evidence, there was an involvement over a somewhat longer period. On any view, the venture to which the respondent became a party was one of considerable proportions, and one in which he occupied a significant role. The evidence showed, moreover, that he elected to maintain his involvement in this activity, even though he suspected at one stage that he had come under police notice. 
      
       
     35 The Courts have long stressed the need, in cases such as the present, for sentencing Judges to impose condign sentences which appropriately reflect the elements of retribution, punishment and deterrence, both personal and general: see Regina v Quang Vinh Dang, NSWCCA, 7 November 1997 and Regina v Laurentio and Becheru (1992) 63 A Crim R 402. 
      
       
     36 When the objective criminality of the respondent is compared with the maximum available sentence; and when proper attention is given to the need for condign sentences in relation to those who are significantly involved in the supply chain for the substances of heroin and amphetamines; then I am left with the firm conclusion that there must have here been some misapplication of principle. 
      
       
     37 In particular, I am satisfied that the starting points for the heroin and methylamphetamine offences which his Honour identified were lower than a proper application of principle required. That this is so is indicated by the five decisions cited in argument by the Crown, in three of which assistance had been given by the offender. Those cases were Regina v Paul Kon Lim, NSWCCA 28 September 1993, Regina v Khaled Hamzy (1994) 74 A Crim R 341, Regina v Qing Quan Liang NSWCCA, 2 June 1995, Regina v Charles Michael Cassar [1999] NSWCCA 152, and Regina v Syed Tareq Hameed [2001] NSWCCA 287.  
      
       
     38 In each of those cases, with the exception of the last mentioned case - where there was an extremely high level of immediate assistance given, which required that the respondent go into protection, and which was likely to require a change of identity, and or continued protection post-release - the overall sentences or minimum terms which were either confirmed or increased on appeal exceeded that imposed by his Honour. 
      
       
     39 In the present case the material provided also discloses that assistance was offered by the respondent, albeit some years after his arrest, and that such assistance has continued. It has been assessed as being reliable and of considerable value, and it may have potentially adverse effects for the respondent. I see no reason to disagree with that assessment having read the material. To its significance I shall return.  
      
       
        
       (B) DISCOUNT FOR PLEAS OF GUILTY 
        
       
     40 I am of the view that there was error disclosed in his Honour’s approach to discounting the sentence for the pleas of guilty. Those pleas were made over three years after the respondent was arrested. They came after pleas of not guilty had been entered and a jury empanelled; and they followed a ruling adverse to the respondent in relation to the admissibility of the listening device material. They also came after committal proceedings had been held, in which a seventy five year old woman had been required to attend for cross examination, and in circumstances where there was a risk that she may not have survived until the trial. 
      
       
     41 In no circumstances could the pleas be properly regarded other than as pleas offered at the last moment; and as such they involved a very late acceptance of responsibility on the part of the respondent. 
      
       
     42 It was also not open, in my view, for his Honour to have regarded the plea of guilty in this case as one reflecting contrition, when it was only entered after failing to have the trial Judge exclude the listening device evidence. Such contrition, as was otherwise noted in the presentence report or the psychologist’s report, was more related to the personal predicament in which the respondent found himself, to his own embarrassment; and to the consequences it has had for his family, than it was for the community, which is placed at such great risk by those who trade in drugs. No insight whatsoever, in this respect, can be discerned in the material placed before his Honour. For that reason I cannot see why it was open to his Honour to provide anything other than a modest discount for the respondent’s displayed willingness to facilitate the course of justice (Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6), or for contrition. 
      
       
     43 In Regina v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, after indicating an appropriate range for discount for what was there identified as utilitarian reasons, alone of 10-25%, Spigelman CJ said at para 154:- 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         There are.. two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
          
         (i) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
          
         (ii) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea 
         .” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     44 This decision needs now to be considered in the light of Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6, a decision handed down after the sentence was imposed. It does not, however, call for any different value to be attached to the willingness of the Respondent to facilitate the course of justice in this case. In that regard, the ruling on the admissibility of the listening device evidence did not delay the time which should be considered as having been the first responsible opportunity to plead. Its admission was not as essential to the Crown case which already was strong. Nor did the fact of the late plea demonstrate much, if anything, by way of contrition. 
      
       
     45 In case there should be a misapprehension that a discount of 25% is routinely to be extended for pleas of guilty, either by reference to the Cameron factors, that is, for their display of an acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, or for the additional fact of contrition, then that notion should be rejected. It does not reflect the result of the decision in Thomson and Houlton or Cameron. In my view, the discount in this case, properly considered, should have fallen markedly towards the bottom end of the range to which the Chief Justice referred. 
      
       
        
       (C) DISCOUNT FOR ASSISTANCE AND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
        
       
     46 The Court is necessarily constrained in relation to any disclosure of the contents of the material provided to it in the sealed envelopes, beyond recording the assessment which I have previously noted as to its reliability and value. Clearly, the respondent was entitled to have that assistance, taken into account in his favour, in accordance with the decisions of this Court in Regina v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 and Regina v Darwiche [1999] NSWCCA 297.  
      
       
     47 It was also properly a matter to be taken into account as a special circumstance; as was his Honour’s assessment that the respondent was in need of an extended period of conditional release, subject to supervision, in order to foster his rehabilitation. Although his Honour also saw a post-release need to deal with his earlier history of drug abuse, the evidence in that regard tended to point somewhat in the opposite direction, since both the presentence report and the psychologist’s report suggested that he had overcome his habit and was unlikely to return to it. Nevertheless, I would be prepared to assume that reinforcement of his need to avoid drugs in times of personal stress could be beneficially addressed during a period of release on parole. 
      
       
     48 The error, as I see it, in this regard, lies in the fact that the discount referable to the assistance was applied wholly to the non-parole period, an approach which was only likely to skew the whole sentencing exercise, particularly after an excessive discount had been given for the pleas when fixing the head sentences. 
      
       
     49 In my view, if a two stage sentencing process was to be undertaken, the combined allowance, for the pleas of guilty and for the assistance, should have been in the order of 40%.  
      
       
     50 The sentence imposed, and particularly the non-parole component, when taken as a whole was, in my view, disproportionate to the objective criminality involved, and was one which gave excessive weight to the subjective circumstances of the offender. The error thus arising was compounded by the consideration to which I next turn. 
      
       
        
       (D) CONCURRENT SENTENCES 
        
       
     51 Contrary to the correct approach indicated in the judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 – to first fix the appropriate sentence for each offence, and then to consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality - his Honour first considered it appropriate to order the sentences to be served concurrently, and then determined the sentence appropriate for each offence. 
      
       
     52 The reason why his Honour took this approach appears also to have involved error, in as much as it failed to pay regard to the fact that the respondent was trafficking in a substantial way, in particular in two separate drugs, heroin and methylamphetamine, over an extended period; and that the charges were not confined to the events of 9 March 1998. In that regard, the terms of the intercepts, as well as the sheer monetary value of the drugs which were still on site after a period of time in which drugs had clearly been taken from the premises and sold, indicates that this was not a case of the type that involves a single episode; or one that involves several connected, but substantially contemporaneous, offences, such as that considered for example in Regina v Williams, NSWCCA, 24 July 1990 – see also Vogel v Anderson (1967) 120 CLR 157 at 158. 
      
       
     53 Having regard to the duration of the criminality, and the considerable quantities of separate drugs in which the respondent dealt, and which he had in his possession when arrested, the present was a case which, in my view, called for some accumulation of sentence, in order to reflect the total criminality involved.  
      
       
     54 In all of these circumstances I am of the view that error has been shown, and that, subject to the principle of double jeopardy, and to the residual discretion of the Court in Crown appeals which was noted in Regina v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 56, Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 and Dinsdale v The Queen, the Court should intervene. If it does so, then it is additionally necessary to note that the sentence imposed should be the least which should have been set below: see Regina v Rose NSWCCA, 23 May 1996, Regina v Giam (No. 2) (1999) 109 A Crim R 348 and Regina v Ceissman [2001] NSWCCA 73.  
      
       
     55 Additionally, it should not be one which would lead, by reference to parity with the sentence imposed upon Kieron MacDonnell, to a justifiable sense of grievance on the respondent’s part: see Regina v Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610 and Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. This further consideration is, however, subject to the qualification that there is no obligation to apply the principle of parity, where the earlier sentence was manifestly inadequate, or where the differences between the two offenders justifies a different result: see Regina v Reid [2000] NSWCCA 166 at para 16 and Regina v Glasby [2000] NSWCCA 83. The present case, particularly for the reasons identified by his Honour, in relation to the respective roles of the two offenders, and the different number of offences proffered against them, comes within the qualification. 
      
       
     56 In my view, the inadequacy of the sentences for the offences involved was such that this Court should resentence the respondent, notwithstanding the residual discretion which it has; and after taking into account the additional material which was tendered on his behalf. That material, which was in the form of a report from the alcohol and drug officer, noted that the respondent had made contact with the service on 11 October 2001, and has been demonstrating a willingness to continue to address his drug addiction and his descent into criminal activity. It also shows that he has maintained abstinence while in custody.  
      
       
     57 Taking this material into account, and having regard to the principles which govern Crown appeals against leniency, I would propose the following orders:- 
      
       
        
       (1) appeal allowed;  
        
        
       (2) sentences in respect of counts 1 and 3 quashed; 
        
        
       (3) the respondent be sentenced, in relation to count 3 (supply large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine) to imprisonment for 8 years, to date from 23 August 2001, and to expire on 22 August 2009, with a non-parole period of 5 years, also to date from 23 August 2001, and to expire on 22 August 2006; 
        
        
       (4) the respondent be sentenced in relation to count 1 (supply large commercial quantity of heroin) to imprisonment for 9 years, to date from 23 August 2003, and to expire on 22 August 2012, with a non-parole period of 5 years, to date from 23 August 2003, and to expire on 22 August 2008, such sentence to be served partly concurrently with and partially cumulatively upon the sentence for count 3; 
        
        
       (5) the earliest date upon which the respondent would be eligible for release on parole would accordingly be 23 August 2008.  
        
        
       This would result in a total sentence of 11 years, with a non-parole period of 7 years.  
        
       
     58 In fixing those sentences I have given allowance for the plea of guilty and also for the assistance which I have noted. I would leave the sentence for count 2 unaltered; and I would find special circumstances in relation to the assistance provided, and the need to further the respondent’s rehabilitation, as well as the need to address his earlier drug addiction and earlier issues which led to his descent into serious criminality. Those special circumstances are such as to vary the proportion which the non-parole period bears to the head sentence for each count, and also for the overall sentence, from that specified in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
      
       
     59 I observe that, in this case, his Honour adopted the two-stage sentencing process which has been criticised in particular by McHugh and Hayne JJ (in AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111; see also, Wong and Leung v The Queen (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 64 per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.), despite the transparency which it brings to the sentencing process, as noted by Kirby J in Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6. I would not find error, on his Honour’s part, in following that approach and in giving consideration to an appropriate starting point, against which the factors of assistance and of the plea could be considered. Unless they are given separate consideration, whether specifically quantified in the reasons or not, it is difficult to understand how the “instinctive synthesis” approach can be applied, or how it can result in a “single appropriate sentence”. However, even if that approach is taken, with its recognised advantage of ensuring a proper balance of the objective and subjective factors, without any overlap in discounts for individual factors, which might skew the outcome, I am confirmed in my view that the sentences here imposed were so manifestly lenient as to require appellate correction. 
      
       
     60 SULLY J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL 
      
       
     61 DOWD J: I have read the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in draft form. I agree with the proposed orders and with his Honour’s reasons.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GILES JA: The appellant was tried on an indictment charging him with causing grievous bodily harm to John William Varley with intent to murder (Crimes Act 1900, s 27), and in the alternative maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on John William Varley with intent to do so (Crimes Act, s 33). He was found guilty on the first charge, and a verdict on the alternative charge was not required. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years. He appealed against both conviction and sentence.  
      
       
     2 It was acknowledged that all grounds of appeal were such that, if the appeal were upheld, there should be a new trial. We first heard submissions on the ground of appeal, “The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury as to the basis of Gilbert’s conviction and sentence”. At the conclusion of the submissions we ordered that the appeal be upheld, the conviction be quashed, and a new trial be held. We said that our reasons would be delivered at a later date. These are my reasons for the orders. 
      
       
        
       The principal issue 
       
     3 There was no doubt that grievous bodily harm had been caused to or inflicted on Mr Varley. The principal issue in the trial was whether his injuries were caused by the appellant or by Mr Michael Gilbert.  
      
       
     4 Mr Varley was severely injured. He suffered a depressed fracture of the right frontal bone over the forehead, bruising to the frontal lobes of the brain and a cracked skull at the back. He had a scar from his right ear over the top of his head to his left ear, and nerve damage which caused his face to drop and his left eye lid to hang down. He had no sense of smell and difficulty in swallowing.  
      
       
     5 Mr Varley could not say who had injured him. He went to a hotel. He was introduced to the appellant and another man, on the Crown case Mr Gilbert. During the evening he put his wallet on the bar, then turned away, and when he turned back it had gone. He accused the appellant and the appellant’s companion, saying one of them must have taken his wallet. The appellant said he did not have the wallet. The other man said that the appellant had the wallet and should give it back, but the appellant maintained his denial. Mr Varley left the hotel a little later. The appellant and his companion left in front of him. Mr Varley said that his next recollection was waking up in hospital.  
      
       
     6 It is not necessary to go deeply into the other Crown evidence at the trial. It implicated the appellant rather than Mr Gilbert. There was some direct evidence apart from that of Mr Gilbert. Mr Frank Hull saw a man of Maori appearance standing at the head of a person on the ground, apparently in a rage, and said that the man appeared to kick the head or face of the person on the ground; he saw a smaller man standing at the feet of the person on the ground. The appellant is of Maori appearance, and is a bigger man than Mr Gilbert. Ms Robyn McKenzie saw a smaller man and a big man going up a laneway and then running out of the laneway. Mr Mark Murphy saw much the same, plus hearing the big man saying to the smaller man “I want this bloke in a fucking box”. Mr Varley was found up the laneway in the location seen by Mr Hull. There was other evidence from which it could be concluded that the smaller man was Mr Gilbert.  
      
       
        
       Mr Gilbert’s conviction and sentence 
        
       
     7 Mr Gilbert was called by the Crown. His evidence began, after giving his name - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You are currently in prison? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. And is that following a jury verdict in relation to a trial in relation to your involvement in the matter currently before the court? 
          
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
        
       
     8 Mr Gilbert then gave evidence that he was acquainted with the appellant, and that they went together to the hotel. He said that they were not introduced to Mr Varley, and that he did not remember any discussion with a man in relation to a missing wallet. When he and the appellant left the hotel he got into the passenger seat of his car, with the appellant to drive. He saw the appellant arguing with the driver of a white car. The white car then ran into the back of Mr Gilbert’s car. The appellant pursued the white car and ran into it. Mr Gilbert said that he left the car and tried to hide. Then he and the appellant went up the laneway to the white car, and the appellant and the driver of the white car had a fight in which the driver of the white car was knocked to the ground and the appellant picked up a brick and threw it down onto his head. 
      
       
     9 In the cross-examination of Mr Gilbert various matters in relation to the reliability or credibility of this evidence were elicited, or at least put to him. The thrust of the cross-examination was that Mr Gilbert had a psychiatric condition which caused him to become violent from time to time, and that he had been driving his car, had become angry when the white car ran into it, and had pursued the white car and fought with its driver. The substance of this was put to Mr Gilbert more than once, on the last occasion the culminating question and answer being - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I suggest to you that you were in such a rage that you pursued and attacked Mr Varley? 
          
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     10 Counsel for the appellant immediately moved to a new matter - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You have a real interest in being here don’t you and giving evidence in these proceedings? 
          
         A. I don’t understand. 
          
           
          
         Q. I suggest to you that you went to trial in this court in July of this year and that you were convicted? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
           
          
         Q. And you were convicted of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
           
          
         Q. And you were sentenced in relation to those proceedings. 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But before you were sentenced you entered into an agreement with the Crown with respect to this trial?” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     11 This seems to have been the beginning of putting to Mr Gilbert that he had agreed with the Crown to give evidence in the appellant’s trial in order to receive a reduced sentence when himself convicted, and that he had promised and then given false evidence implicating the appellant in order to obtain and retain the reduced sentence. Although not fully carried out, in due course that cross-examination progressed. But before the cross-examiner had gone further, the trial judge intervened - 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Ms Kluss are you aware of the Crown case against Gilbert.

         KLUSS: Yes your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well you might be and the Crown Prosecutor might be but I’m not. Ladies and gentlemen this is a matter that I desire to discuss with counsel in your absence because it isn’t quite as simple as it sounds.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     12 The transcript then reads –

         “KLUSS: Q. You went to trial with respect to these matters on 10,11, 12 and 13 July of this year. Is that correct? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is it the situation that you were convicted of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to so cause that grievous bodily harm? 
          
         A. Yes.

         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And indeed the Judge who sentenced you indicated to you that that assistance provided to the Crown was worth 50 per cent of the sentence that you would serve. 
          
         A. Yes.

         A. Yes.

         Q. But because of the assistance and because you were giving evidence in this trial that in fact your sentence would be three years? 
          
         A. Yes,

         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the additional two years in the community? 
          
         A. Yes.

         Q. If you don’t give evidence in this trial you know that you can be re-sentenced don’t you? 
          
         A. Yes.

         A. Yes 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So when you were at your trial the accused never gave evidence in your trial did he? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And indeed his ERISP interview was never shown to the jury either was it?

     14 The transcript then records - 
      
       
        
         
         “KLUSS: Your Honour I appreciate that your Honour wishes to make some comment to the jury. Is that a convenient time? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Have you finished? 
         
        
        
         
         KLUSS: There are some Browne and Dunn [sic] matters that I wanted to go to but there was nothing else on this particular aspect. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: You complete your. [sic]” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     15 After some short further cross-examination, the trial judge addressed the jury. It is desirable to set out in full what he said - 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Ladies and gentlemen, I was concerned that you may have been misled, inadvertently misled, by a line of questions that were being put to Mr Gilbert and I consider it important that you know the basis of Mr Gilbert’s conviction and the basis of the sentence that was imposed. You are of course aware that he was convicted and he was sentenced for his part in the assault on Varley.  
         The evidence in this trial was substantially the same as the evidence that you have heard from this trial. That is to say that the same police witnesses were called, the same experts, the same lay witnesses who heard statements being made, who saw things happen in the lane and so on. 
         
        
        
         
         It is the law, ladies and gentlemen, that when two people, two or more people but in this case two people, enter into an agreement to commit a crime and when they engage in some joint criminal enterprise pursuant to that agreement, then each of them is responsible for the actions performed by the other in the course of that joint criminal enterprise in the course of that agreement. To give you an example removed from this case, if two men decide to hold up the TAB in Gosford, one man sits in the car revving up the engine whilst the other man goes in with a shotgun, holds up the TAB, brings back the money and gets into the car, both of them are equally liable for that holdup. That is so even though one man did not hold the shotgun at any stage, he didn’t threaten anybody at the TAB, he didn’t take any money, he didn’t touch any money, but he is equally liable because the agreement between then [sic] was that they would rob the TAB so even though one man only drove the car he is just as guilty as the man who had the shotgun. 
         
        
        
         
         In this case the Crown alleged in the trial of Mr Gilbert that there was a joint criminal enterprise, an agreement to assault Varley. This man was charged and the trial against him was conducted on the basis that although he didn’t lay a hand on Varley, that he didn’t use the brick or he didn’t do anything physically to Varley, that he was liable because he had agreed with the accused that Varley would be attacked. The joint criminal enterprise upon which they had set about, upon which they had agreed, was the attack on Varley. So that in the trial against Gilbert the Crown relied upon his participation in the sense that he was there and that he was ready, willing and able if required to assist the accused. He was guilty even though, on the Crown case in his trial, even though he didn’t touch Varley. 
         
        
        
         
         There was no evidence at his trial from any source to suggest that Gilbert used the brick or did anything to Varley. The jury in his trial was never asked to consider whether Gilbert had used the brick or any violence on the victim. The Crown case was that Nale, this accused, had performed the violence and as I say, there was no evidence to the contrary. It was on that basis that the trial judge left the case to the jury and it was on that basis that the jury returned a guilty verdict against Gilbert. The basis was their joint criminal enterprise, not on the basis that he, Gilbert had used any violence against Varley. Even though he didn’t, he was equally guilty. The trial judge sentenced Gilbert on that basis. 
         
        
        
         
         That of course ladies and gentlemen does not prevent, is not any bar to the accused in this case to assert that it was Gilbert who proffered the violence to Varley. It is no bar to the accused in this matter raising the defence that it wasn’t him who used the brick, that it was Gilbert. 
         
        
        
         
         As to whether the accused did what the Crown says that he did, that it was the accused who violently assaulted Varley with that brick or in any other way it is for your to say. I will of course instruct you further as to what matters the Crown must prove before any guilty verdict can be returned. 
         
        
        
         
         Whilst you have been out, I have read the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence and it is clear that he took into account Gilbert’s agreement to give evidence in this trial when fixing sentence. It is the law, ladies and gentlemen, that sentencing judge must do that.  
         The law must give credit to a person who is prepared to take the risks that are involved in giving evidence against somebody who is charged with violent crimes. 
         
        
        
         
         Before Gilbert was sentenced nothing was indicated to him by the Judge as to what discount would be given to him. The way it’s done is that if the person says ‘I will co-operate with the authorities by giving evidence against a co-offender’ the Judge then says ‘All right you’ve agreed to do that I will give you a discount’ and as I say the judge is bound to do that. So that’s what happened in the case of Gilbert, that’s what happened in this trial and that’s what happened on his sentence. As I say he was convicted on the basis that he was jointly liable for the actions of this accused.  
         That, however, does not prevent this accused in his trial from saying though that isn’t the way it happened, it was he, Gilbert, who used the brick, it was he Gilbert who was violent to Varley not me and as I say in due course you’re going to have to decide whether the accused did what he is charged with and I’ll give you further instructions before you come to consider your verdict in that regard 
         .” (underlining and italics added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     16 I have underlined and italicised in the trial judge’s remarks the passages most material to the ground of appeal, although of course what was said must be considered as a whole. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     17 There was then brief re-examination of Mr Gilbert, and at its conclusion the transcript records - 
      
       
        
         
         “IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Mr Kluss, with regards to the remarks that I just made to the jury are there any alterations or amendments that you seek? 
         
        
        
         
         KLUSS: Your Honour, I was inclined to ask your Honour when your Honour was summing up to indicate to the jury that, and I appreciate that your Honour has done this with some respect but to emphasise to the jury that no determination of another court is binding upon their determination of fact. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Remind me, if I forget to do that would you remind me of that? 
         
        
        
         
         KLUSS: Most certainly. I appreciate that your Honour has already adverted to it but I’d ask that it be stressed. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: No I think what you say is entirely reasonable and I’ll do it but remind me about it in case I omit to do so.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     18 The trial judge’s summing-up included - 
      
       
        
         
         “During the course of this trial I was explaining to you what had occurred in the trial of Gilbert and the conviction of Gilbert and at that time I told you that whatever occurred in Gilbert’s trial was no bar whatsoever to the accused in this trial asserting that it was Gilbert and not he who proffered violence to Varley. I cannot emphasise it too strongly ladies and gentlemen that what occurred in the trial of Gilbert is in no way shape or form binding upon you. You are concerned only with the evidentiary material before you in this trial, which is no doubt different from that what was present in the other trial. For instance, Mr Varley did not give evidence in Gilbert’s trial. If he had done so we do not know what the result might have been. So you must not guess or speculate about the course of Gilbert’s trial, what was done in that trial and so on. You must concentrate on the evidence in this case. Put aside any other matter. 
         
        
        
         
         Now you have each taken a solemn oath to determine this matter on the evidence in this trial. Your oath binds you to do that. Your oath also binds you to accept my directions with regard to any matter of law, and what I have told you is a direction with regard to the law. I confidently expect that you will be true to your oaths and that you will put aside any matters that you have not observed, either in the witness box or from the material that has been tendered before you, and that you will use only that material as a basis for any decision that you would arrive at. Now do you have any difficulties with understanding that direction, because if you do raise them.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       Was there error in the trial judge’s remarks? 
       
     19 To repeat, the ground of appeal was, “The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury as to the basis of Gilbert’s conviction and sentence”. On the submissions, the complaint was not so much about what the trial judge said in the summing-up as about what he said at the conclusion of the cross-examination of Mr Gilbert. 
      
       
     20 We do not know what was said between the trial judge and counsel in the discussion in the absence of the jury. It seems that his Honour was moved to intervene by it being brought out in cross-examination that Mr Gilbert’s conviction for his “involvement in the matter currently before the court”, which the Crown had led in those vague terms, was a conviction for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. It appears that his Honour was concerned that the jury might reason that, if Mr Gilbert had been convicted on that charge, it followed that Mr Gilbert had caused or inflicted the grievous bodily harm and the appellant had not caused or inflicted the grievous bodily harm.  
      
       
     21 It was accepted in the appeal that this was a legitimate concern, and that his Honour could properly have said something to the jury at the time so that they should not misuse the evidence. There was nothing wrong in counsel for the appellant eliciting, as part of the cross-examination concerning Mr Gilbert’s sentencing discount, that Mr Gilbert had been convicted of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. (After the trial judge’s intervention and before he made his remarks to the jury this was amplified as maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so, which was the alternative charge against the appellant.) Indeed, it may have been appropriate for the Crown to have led the conviction and sentencing discount in chief. But the appellant submitted that what his Honour said went much too far, and introduced irrelevant and prejudicial material into the trial which the summing-up did not cure. 
      
       
     22 The appellant referred to R v Stokes (CCA, 16 June 1988, unreported), and it is instructive first to consider that case. The accused was charged with having sexual intercourse without consent. The complainant had been taken to a shed by five men, one being the accused. Another of the men had had the sexual intercourse. The accused was charged as a principal in the second degree. 
      
       
     23 The reasons of Street CJ, with whom Lee and Maxwell JJ agreed, were relevantly - 
      
       
        
         
         “During the course of the cross examination of the complainant it became apparent that there were to be some questions asked of her regarding evidence given on other occasions. His Honour then, in order to assist the jury to understand the significance of evidence given elsewhere, gave to the jury an instruction in the following terms: 
         
        
        
         
         ‘Members of the jury, to assist your understanding of the case I deem it appropriate to tell you this. Arising out of the alleged occurrences that have been referred to in this trial, there have been two previous trials as well as the committal hearing. At the first of such trials in July of last year three accused persons appeared, not including this accused. That trial aborted for reasons you need not concern yourselves with and no verdicts were returned. Those same three accused were re-tried in October 1986 and the jury on that occasion convicted two and acquitted one. 
         
        
        
         
         Now members of the jury I inform you of that background simply so that you can more readily understand the cross-examination which will probably now ensue by Mr Cook. I warn you not to speculate either as to who those three persons were who were placed on trial or as to who it was who was convicted and who was acquitted. That is completely irrelevant for your purposes. Your task is to consider the evidence against this accused and this accused alone.’ 
         
        
        
         
         It is contended on behalf of the appellant that his Honour having told the jury that two other of the five men had been convicted in an earlier trial, and that the jury should not speculate as to who they were, that is to say, who it was who was convicted and who was acquitted. 
         
        
        
         
         Accepting that his Honour’s intention was to assist the jury with a fuller understanding, it nevertheless stands out irrefutably that putting before the jury this irrelevant and hence inadmissible material carried with it a very real and substantial prospect of prejudicing the jury’s evaluation of the evidence being given by the complainant of the events in the hut on that evening. 
         
        
        
         
         The information was irrelevant. It was prejudicial and, in the view that I take, no direction could have been adequate to correct or excise it from the jury’s later evaluation of the facts. The circumstances that it passed without protest by counsel for the appellant at the trial does not, in my view, preclude it being advanced on appeal before this Court for the first time, bearing in mind the gravely prejudicial overtones of what took place. 
         
        
        
         
         On the whole I am persuaded that this must be regarded as a trial in which there was a miscarriage of justice and it follows that I consider that the appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and there should be a direction for a new trial.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     24 The irrelevant and prejudicial material was that two other of the five men had been convicted in an earlier trial. The Chief Justice did not spell out why it was irrelevant and prejudicial, but at least one basis can readily be seen. If the two other men had been convicted, the complainant’s evidence of sexual intercourse without consent must have been accepted by the earlier jury. It was irrelevant in the accused’s trial that the complainant’s evidence had been accepted by the previous jury, and highly prejudicial. 
      
       
     25 What the trial judge said in the present case was of the same kind, but worse.  
      
       
     26 Through the second and third underlined passages the trial judge in effect told the jury that the Crown’s opinion was that the appellant, not Mr Gilbert, had inflicted the grievous bodily harm on Mr Varley. Through the first and third underlined passages the trial judge in effect told the jury that the witnesses who had given evidence before them had been accepted by the earlier jury, and more particularly that the earlier jury had found that the appellant, not Mr Gilbert, had inflicted the grievous bodily harm on Mr Varley. The trial judge’s remarks included, in the third underlined passage, that the Crown case at the earlier trial was that the appellant “had performed the violence” and that “it was on that basis that the jury returned a guilty verdict against Gilbert”. That was a blunt indication that the appellant had inflicted the grievous bodily harm on Mr Varley. 
      
       
     27 None of this could have been given in evidence if the Crown had sought to do so. It should not have been put before the jury, but it was put before the jury by the judge otherwise than as evidence, and with the authority of his office and in circumstances such that the line was blurred between the trial judge’s directions which the jury was bound to accept and the evidence in the case which it was for the jury to evaluate. The prejudicial effect must have been enormous. 
      
       
     28 Although it was raised but in passing, there was a further aspect of irrelevancy and prejudice. Whilst reference to sentencing policy which made it appropriate to give a sentencing discount could be explained, it was important that any explanation be provided in agreed terms. In the fourth underlined passage what the trial judge said was capable of being seen by the jury as suggesting that the appellant was a violent man. It is not necessary to say more of this in order to dispose of the appeal. 
      
       
     29 The trial judge did say, in the first of the italicised passages, that what had happened in Mr Gilbert’s trial “does not prevent” or “is not any bar to” the appellant “to assert that it was Gilbert who proffered the violence to Varley” or “raising the defence that it wasn’t him who used the brick, that it was Gilbert”. This was repeated in the second of the italicised passages, in the language that what had happened in Mr Gilbert’s trial “does not prevent this accused in his trial from saying though that isn’t the way it happened …”. Two important things may be said of these passages. First, the trial judge’s remarks were left as relevant material for the jury’s consideration. Secondly, the caveat was only that they were not conclusive against the appellant, who was still entitled to maintain that “that isn’t the way it happened”. Use of the remarks as evidence of “the way it happened” was endorsed. The ostensible recognition of the appellant’s interests in fact exacerbated the problem. 
      
       
     30 The Crown submitted that the trial judge’s remarks were justified by R v Booth (1982) 2 NSWLR 847. That, however, was quite a different case.  
      
       
     31 A convicted co-conspirator gave evidence for the Crown. The Crown led from him in chief that he had been “charged in relation to this matter that is now before the court” and had “been dealt with”. Objection having duly been taken, on appeal it was contended that this was not relevant to any issue which fell to the jury to determine, and was prejudicial to the accused because it amounted to suggesting to the jury that the person named in the indictment together with the accused had been charged with the same conspiracy and had admitted his guilt. 
      
       
     32 Street CJ said that the evidence was relevant because it established that the witness was an accomplice and so that there was a duty to warn the jury that his evidence was inherently suspect. His Honour continued (at 849-50) -  
      
       
        
         
         “It is then contended that the Crown went too far by adducing evidence going beyond the mere fact that the witness was an accomplice. It is said that it is not open to the Crown to establish, as did the Crown in the present prosecution, that the putative accomplice has been charged in relation to the matter in question and dealt with. I leave aside consideration of how that might be proved without going to the length that the present evidence went to. It seems to me that the conclusion is inescapable that the full nature of the position of the witness as an accomplice is necessarily opened up as a relevant matter for evidence, so that the jury may be able to give proper meaning and carry properly into effect the warning which the trial judge is required to give them. Quite plainly, it would be of more significance in the jury's mind in evaluating the effect of the warning if it knew that the accomplice was still awaiting being dealt with. Equally, if an accomplice has been dealt with, the effect of the judicial warning can then be related by the jury to the determination of the weight which they will give to the evidence of the accomplice. 
         
        
        
         
         It is well recognized in practice that accomplices should normally be finally dealt with before being called to give evidence in support of the Crown. It will rarely arise in practice that an accomplice who has not been finally dealt with, or who perhaps may not have received a pardon or otherwise has had his position finalized, will be called to give evidence. But the comparative rarity of the situation does not necessarily preclude the investigation, as a relevant subject matter, of precisely what may be the individual status of the particular accomplice whose evidence is being tendered, and in respect of whom the judge in due course must give to the jury a warning in relation to his evidence. It may be desirable in clear cases that the warning be given when the evidence is tendered, but this is a matter for the trial judge.” 
          
         
        
       
     33 O’Brien CJ of Cr D said (at 850) - 
      
       
        
         
         “Once the principle is conceded that the attention of the jury must be directed to the risk inherent in accepting the evidence of a witness whom they find to be an accomplice of the accused, it becomes relevant, in the assessment by the jury of that risk, to know whether he has any advantage to gain from the Crown in his giving evidence against the accused. It is relevant therefore that the jury should know that he has been charged and dealt with, if that be the case, since that source of risk would thereby be removed. The evidence that he has been charged and dealt with is therefore in my view admissible, and its weight is not overborne by the alleged prejudice to the accused in the disclosure simply that he has been charged and dealt with.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     34 Lee J agreed with the Chief Justice, with some additional observations to the effect that the witness’s status as an accomplice and his position vis à vis the Crown was a relevant matter and the jury should not be left to speculate. 
      
       
     35 Nothing in R v Booth justified the trial judge’s remarks. Mr Gilbert’s conduct on the occasion when Mr Varley was injured and his conviction and sentencing were proper matters for evidence in order to show that he was an accomplice and enable the weight to be given to his testimony to be assessed. But the trial judge’s remarks were not evidence of that kind, or indeed at all. The nature of Mr Gilbert’s position as an accomplice depended on what he did, as brought out in examination in chief and cross-examination, not on his earlier conviction. The cross-examination was directed to whether Mr Gilbert had any advantage to be gained by giving evidence against the appellant, and the trial judge’s intervention was neither necessary nor appropriate in that connection. The trial judge’s remarks were quite outside anything authorised by R v Booth. 
      
       
     36 It would not be satisfactory to criticise the trial judge’s remarks without giving some attention to what could properly have been said to the jury. There is no single acceptable course, and whatever might be said should first be discussed with counsel. The trial judge could have said something like - 
      
       
        
         
         “You have heard that Mr Gilbert was convicted of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Varley. You may think that the fact that he was convicted of that offence has some bearing on whether the accused committed one of the offences for which he now stands charged. It does not. I now direct you that as a matter of law the fact that Mr Gilbert was convicted says nothing as to whether he was the one who caused Mr Varley’s injuries or the accused was the one who caused the injuries, and you must not use that fact as evidence one way or the other in deciding whether or not the accused caused the injuries.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       Did the summing-up cure the error? 
        
       
     37 The Crown submitted that any error had been overcome by the passage in the summing-up earlier set out. The trial judge did not repeat his description of Mr Gilbert’s trial and the basis of his conviction. But nor did he unequivocally tell the jury, after reflection, that what he had earlier said should be put out of their minds. On the contrary, by again saying that what occurred in Mr Gilbert’s trial was “in no way shape or form binding on you” he left his remarks as material for the jury’s consideration. Although he also told the jury to concentrate on the evidence in the case, put aside any other matter, and put aside any matter they had not observed in the witness box or from the materials that had been tendered before them, that still left the significant possibility that the jury would regard the remarks, coming from the presiding judge whose directions in law they were bound to accept, as something to which they could also pay regard. It may be that the error could not have been overcome by unequivocally telling the jury that the remarks should be put out of their minds. But the summing-up certainly did not, in the words of R v Stokes, “correct or excise [the remarks] from the jury’s later evaluation of the facts”. 
      
       
        
       Other Crown submissions 
       
     38 The Crown submitted that counsel for the appellant had not objected to the trial judge making his remarks, that by force of rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules leave was required for the ground of appeal, and that leave should be declined. 
      
       
     39 As I have said, we do not know what was said between the trial judge and counsel in the discussion in the absence of the jury. No objection to the trial judge making the remarks he then outlined is noted, as would be expected if counsel for the appellant had objected. Perhaps the trial judge’s intention was firmly expressed and brooked no opposition, although that is when counsel must be respectfully fearless.  
      
       
     40 But the Crown had a responsibility also, to dissuade the trial judge from error. It may be that rule 4 strictly does not apply to the trial judge’s remarks, because they were not a direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence. The rule could apply if the relevant omission be regarded as occurring when the trial judge did not in his summing-up unequivocally tell the jury that what he had earlier said should be put out of their minds. Without troubling over this, the Crown does not seem to have endeavoured to save the trial judge from error, and the prejudice was great. If leave be necessary, it should be granted. 
      
       
     41 Finally, the Crown submitted that the proviso in s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be applied, and that the Court should conclude that no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred and dismiss the appeal.  
      
       
     42 There was the evidence of Mr Hull, Ms McKenzie and Mr Murphy to which I have referred. Other evidence assisted to place the appellant at the place where Mr Varley’s injuries were inflicted. There was undoubtedly a Crown case of some strength. But the appellant gave evidence, saying that Mr Gilbert had been driving when there was the collision with the white car, that Mr Gilbert had pursued the white car, then run up the laneway, and that he (the appellant) had seen Mr Gilbert kicking Mr Varley and had pulled him away. The principal issue remained, and only Mr Gilbert’s evidence had the appellant picking up a brick and throwing it down on Mr Varley’s head. That was important to the intent to murder, and it was acknowledged that in the summing-up the trial judge correctly described Mr Gilbert’s evidence as critical.  
      
       
     43 The trial judge’s remarks significantly undermined the appellant’s evidence and in consequence boosted that of Mr Gilbert. I do not think it can be said that a jury properly instructed would inevitably have convicted the appellant if the trial judge had not brought into their consideration the irrelevant and prejudicial material. In any event, the judicial intervention was a fundamental flaw in the appellant’s trial. In my opinion the proviso did not apply.

      Judgment 
       
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I will invite Grove J to give the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act asserting the inadequacy of sentence imposed by G.S. Hosking, DCJ at Sydney District Court on 8 November 2001. 
      
       
     3 On that occasion the respondent appeared for sentence, having pleaded guilty to offences before a magistrate. Those offences were supplying a prohibited drug in a commercial quantity, being 519.85 grams of methylamphetamine; supplying a prohibited drug, being 1.8 grams of substance commonly referred to as ecstasy; supplying a prohibited drug, being 465.6 grams of pseudoephedrine; supplying a prohibited drug, being 5.4 grams of cocaine and, finally, possessing a prohibited firearm, being a rifle with silencer attached.  
      
       
     4 His Honour was also asked to take into account seven further offences on a Form 1, six of them relating to weapons and ammunition and the seventh to goods in custody, being reasonably suspected of having been stolen or unlawfully obtained. 
      
       
     5 Taking the matters on Form 1 into account, the respondent was sentenced on the first charge relating to the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine to imprisonment for four years and four months with a non parole period of two years and ten months. On the further four counts he was sentenced to imprisonment to be served concurrently, to terms of six months, twelve months, six months and twelve months respectively. The respondent had been in custody since his arrest on 8 February 2001 and it is observed that the fixed term sentences are now all expired. 
      
       
     6 The respondent was residing with his fiancée in premises at Lugarno. A statement by Detective Inspector Henness reveals that he was investigation manager of an inquiry relative to suspected drug offences being committed by one Ronald Young. In the course of that investigation warrants were obtained to intercept telephone calls made on a mobile telephone operated by Young. Those investigations led to police awareness of frequent contact between Young and the respondent. In due course, pursuant to warrant, police entered the respondent’s premises on 28 February 2001. Although he was in the house, the respondent did not respond to police demand for entry and it was forced, following which the respondent was located crouched behind a bar. He attempted to flee but was restrained in the bedroom of the premises. 
      
       
     7 Search revealed the quantities of prohibited drugs mentioned in the charges and, in addition to the rifle and silencer mentioned in the fifth count, police located a stolen and unsecured self loading pistol, a second self loading pistol, two crossbows and 196 rounds of assorted ammunition. The rifle, which was the subject of the fifth count, was equipped with a magazine containing seven live rounds. 
      
       
     8 His Honour did not make a specific finding concerning the intended use of this weaponry in terms of whether the respondent had possession for defence or offence. A submission has been made to this court that no finding should be made other than that the weapons were kept for defence. For my part I find it difficult to imagine how one would find a crossbow or a rifle fitted with a silencer was exclusively for the purpose of defence. However, there was no finding by his Honour and I would leave the matter relatively neutral. 
      
       
     9 The learned sentencing judge found that it was clear that the respondent was “running what might be described as a drug supply business from his home” and that included in the business operation was the offer of the range of illicit products identified in the first four counts. 
      
       
     10 It is convenient to mention a Crown submission concerning a remark by his Honour: 
      
       
        
         
          “I note in that respect that whatever his other 
          
          wrongdoings, at least the prisoner did not deal 
          
          or there is no evidence that he was dealing in 
          
          heroin.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     11 It was contended that his Honour fell into error in treating as a mitigating matter the absence of heroin in either somehow diminishing the objective criminality of the conduct or in strengthening the respondent’s subjective case: R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2. 
      
       
     12 I am unpersuaded that his Honour fell into that error. The remark was made in connection with evidence given by the respondent’s sister in particular, that she did not think that her brother understood the seriousness of what he was doing and his Honour made explicit reference to the notoriety of the criminality of drug dealing and the fate of some people connected with it. 
      
       
     13 I would understand his Honour’s remark, as his later remarks intimate, to imply that, although the notorious matters to which he referred might be thought in particular to apply to heroin, they applied to other drugs, including those being dealt by the respondent. 
      
       
     14 His Honour did take into account that there may have been some connection between an event of sexual abuse of the respondent when he was aged about fourteen and his commencement, whilst a teenager, to use drugs. Some hearsay evidence about the event was received from the respondent’s fiancée, but she did not appear to be possessed of any detail and this sparse evidence was only supported by a letter to the respondent’s solicitor from Westmead Sexual Assault Service, which indicated that as at about August 1997 the respondent attended counselling over a ten month period in order to address the psychological effects consequent upon his experience. 
      
       
     15 In favour of the respondent his Honour noted that his prior convictions, whilst serious enough in isolation, would play little part in the sentencing exercise and he expressly said that he did not find that those prior convictions, in any significant way, disqualified the respondent from leniency. I note, however, that included on the respondent’s record were convictions for possessing prohibited drugs in 1996 and 2001, on each occasion a relatively small fine being imposed. 
      
       
     16 The principal thrusts of the Crown submissions were expressed as a failure to give sufficient weight to the offences on Form 1 when sentencing on the first count, the imposition of lenient sentences in respect of the other counts and the failure to have regard to the principle of totality, leading to overall sentences which were manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     17 A written submission categorised the sentence imposed on count one as “barely adequate”, but it became inadequate in that it would then fail to give any proper weight to the Form 1 offences. The latter were by no means minor offences, two of them carrying a prescribed maximum penalty of fourteen years’ imprisonment, another of ten years’ imprisonment and yet another of five years imprisonment. 
      
       
     18 It is true that it has been recognised that when offences are taken into account on a Form 1 the additional penalty will be less than would have been imposed had separate charges been prosecuted. See R v Warman [2001]NSWCCA 147 per Wood CJ at CL. This does not mean, however, that it is true to principle that there should only be little by way of additional penalty imposed when additional offences are taken into account. See R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368; R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63. 
      
       
     19 In considering the inadequacy of sentence imposed, taking into account the firearm offences, it is important to note that, in his rejection of a submission on behalf of the respondent to the contrary, his Honour expressly found (observing the absence of contradictory evidence on behalf of the respondent) that: 
      
       
        
         
          “the only purpose of those weapons, being  
          
          weapons of that kind in the particular places 
          
          that they were found, being, in some cases, 
          
          loaded weapons or with usable live rounds at 
          
          hand, could only have been in the prisoner’s  
          
          possession as an adjunct to his business.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       That finding has not been challenged in this appeal. 
        
       
     20 As I have already observed, the weaponry was the subject of the separate fifth count, as well as the offences taken into account on the Form 1. In my view, it would have seemed more logical to take into account these offences when sentencing in respect of that count rather than the first count. However, it was open to his Honour to undertake the course which he did.  
      
       
     21 It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the Crown submissions, apart from the asserted error concerning the reference to the absence of heroin, really reduced to a submission that there was error in imposing concurrent sentences. The structure of the sentences does not appear to implement the requirements of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. However, it appears to me that the ultimate issue for this Court is whether the sentences imposed, however constructed, have been shown to be manifestly inadequate for the criminality involved. 
      
       
     22 In my view the Crown has demonstrated this. I do not consider that there are extant factors leading to the invocation of residual discretion of this Court to refrain from interfering with sentence on a Crown appeal. 
      
       
     23 The evidence clearly showed that the respondent was dealing in a variety of drugs and, as his Honour found, this went far beyond any support of his own use. I have not overlooked the evidence of the respondent’s fiancée that both of them were, at the relevant time, taking “cannabis, speed, cocaine and ecstasy”. 
      
       
     24 However, the Crown’s contention is made out in the absence of any discernible measure of imposition in the sentence on the first count reflecting the Form 1 offences, despite his Honour’s expression of intention thereto. As his Honour found, the circumstances surrounding were that the weaponry was an adjunct to the unlawful business and they were serious offences.  
      
       
     25 We have been supplied with the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission concerning the supply of commercial quantities of amphetamine and possession of firearms. Those separate statistics are of little use in circumstances such as the present where the essence of criminality is somewhat enhanced by the connection between the drug offence and the possession of the firearms. 
      
       
     26 As has been pointed out by counsel for the respondent a problem does arise in relation to the question of cumulation. I have already observed that the fixed term sentences have expired. In my view, the sentence of twelve months on the fifth count for the rifle with the silencer was, in itself, manifestly inadequate.  
      
       
     27 Were I returning to sentence on that matter, I would regard a sentence of something in the order of three years’ imprisonment as the minimum required to properly reflect the seriousness of that offence in the circumstances. Because those sentences have now expired, it seems to me that the overall situation can best and fairly be met by simply making an adjustment to the sentence on the now only current matter concerning the first count. 
      
       
     28 I would adopt the approach to discount manifested by his Honour in relation to the plea of guilty and the special circumstances which he found. I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
       that the crown appeal be allowed. 
        
       that the sentence imposed on the first count of the indictment be quashed; in lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, to six years and six months imprisonment, to date from 28 February 2001 and to expire on 27 August 2007. 
        
       I would specify a non parole period of four years commencing on 28 February 2001. It would therefore be specified that his first date of eligibility for parole would be 27 February 2005. 
       
     29 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree.30 BARR J: I also agree.31 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as indicated by Grove J.

       The respondent gave formal written undertakings to the Director of Public Prosecutions to give evidence “truthfully and frankly” in accordance with statements made by him inculpating another offender. On being called to testify at the latter’s trials, he disavowed the content of the statements although in the interim he had in respect of crimes committed by him been given an express discount for his promise. The Crown then lodged an appeal pursuant to s5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act. It was submitted that as, despite the recanting by the respondent, the other offender was convicted of one offence there should be an assessment of the value of the respondent’s overall conduct in that context. 
        
        
       HELD: The evident purpose of s5DA is to enable this Court to rectify the situation where a discount against appropriate sentence has been applied to the benefit of the offender on the assumption that he will fulfil the undertaking. It remains appropriate for this Court to take into account any factors relevant to resentence.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SHELLER JA: I agree with Grove J. 
      
       
     2 GROVE J: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act. The relevant provision is: 
      
       
        
         
         “5DA (1) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence imposed on a person that was reduced because the person undertook to assist law enforcement authorities if the person fails wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking. 
         
        
        
         
          (2) On an appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal may, if it is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as it thinks fit. “ 
         
        
       
     3 The respondent appeared before Gibson DCJ in the Sydney District Court where he pleaded guilty to offences of robbery in company; aggravated robbery with wounding; stealing a motor vehicle and using an offensive weapon to resist arrest. In sentencing the respondent for the count of aggravated robbery with wounding his Honour took into account the acknowledgement of guilt of the respondent to offences of possessing offensive weapons and goods in custody. The sentences imposed were concurrent and subsumed within the longest term for the offence of aggravated robbery with wounding which was penal servitude for a total term of ten years and six months, expressed in terms of the then applicable Sentencing Act 1989 as a minimum term of seven years and six months together with an additional term of three years.  
      
       
     4 That offence occurred on 25 November 1997 and involved the respondent and two co-offenders entering a pawnshop in Leichhardt for the purpose of robbery. In the course of this a struggle broke out with the proprietors. The respondent was armed with a knife. He used it. The proprietors were brothers. The elder, aged fifty seven, was stabbed in the back of the neck and on the left side of the face. Twenty four stitches were required to suture these two stab wounds. He required treatment for nerve damage. The younger, aged fifty five, was stabbed on the left side of the neck and this wound also needed surgical suture. Passers-by attempted to contain the offenders within the store but they escaped in a vehicle driven by a fourth participant Ahmet Saltan who had been involved, according to a statement later made by the respondent, in selecting the target of the offence, supplying the knife and transporting the respondent and his co-offenders to and from the location.  
      
       
     5 In December 1997 the respondent made a statement to police in which he described the encounter with Saltan in the course of which he told the respondent about a robbery which he, Saltan, had committed at Burwood Liquorland Store shortly before their meeting. Later on 20 May 1998 the respondent made a further statement to police detailing his and his co-offenders, including Saltan’s participation in the offences at the pawnshop in Leichhardt. 
      
       
     6 In due course on 22 May 1998 the respondent signed two formal undertakings to the Director of Public Prosecutions offering to give evidence against Ahmet Saltan in one case for offences arising out of the robbery of the pawnshop at Leichhardt and the other concerning the robbery at Burwood Liquorland Store.  
      
       
     7 The sentences were imposed by Gibson DCJ one week after these undertakings were given and his Honour was specifically made aware of them. In the course of his remarks on sentence he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am aware that he is entitled to a significant discount for his promise to give evidence and I have deducted two years from the minimum term I would otherwise have imposed”. 
         
        
       
     8 Ahmet Saltan faced two trials and at each trial the respondent was called to give evidence. 
      
       
     9 The first trial concerned the events at the Leichhardt pawnshop. Asked in chief by the Crown Prosecutor about the participation of Saltan he testified, inter alia: 
      
       
        
         
         “No, he didn’t know what was going on, he was in the car.” 
         
        
       
     10 Later asked whether Saltan had been told about what happened in the shop the respondent testified: 
      
       
        
         
         “He was clueless on what was going on.” 
         
        
       
     11 Leave was obtained from the presiding judge for the Crown Prosecutor to cross examine the respondent and, questioned about a reference in his statement to police of 20 May 1998 to Saltan supplying him with a knife and an urging him to use it if necessary, he further testified: 
      
       
        
         
         “To tell you the truth this thing against Mr Saltan is false because at the time I was arrested I was under the influence of heroin and that the police they threatened to viciously assault me if I didn’t comply with them so I did so and I went to sentencing and I was still scared, but now it has been three years you know and I have already hurt one family’s life and I don’t want to wreck another one.” 
         
        
       
     12 Despite this evidence Saltan was convicted by the jury. 
      
       
     13 The second trial of Saltan related to the robbery of Burwood Liquorland. The respondent failed to give evidence of the confession by Saltan allegedly made to him and which had been described in his statement to police on 17 December 1997. In consequence, Saltan was acquitted and discharged on that indictment. 
      
       
     14 The Crown submission is that the sentence imposed upon the respondent should be increased to remove what has now turned out to be an unjustified discount. 
      
       
     15 Counsel for the respondent has contended that the Crown has not established that the respondent was not of assistance in relation to the trial concerning the offence at the Leichhardt pawnshop. He points out that s5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act is not punitive in nature. I agree. As Gleeson CJ said in R v Walters 1994 33 NSWLR 612: 
      
       
        
         
         “Section 5DA which has a counterpart in Commonwealth legislation, was enacted to overcome a problem which was becoming more common in the administration of criminal justice with the increased frequencies of applications by offenders for discounts in sentencing by reason of their willingness to cooperate with the authorities by, for example, giving evidence against co-offenders.” 
         
        
       
     16 It was submitted that because s5DA is not designed punitively then its purpose is to correct any injustice arising out of any failure to assist. I reject that contention. The evident purpose of the provision is to enable the Court to rectify the situation where a discount against appropriate sentence has been applied to the benefit of the offender on the assumption that he will fulfil the relevant undertaking.  
      
       
     17 Counsel drew attention to s442B of the Crimes Act (applicable when the respondent was sentenced but since repealed and replaced in substance by s23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) with particular reference to the apparent intent of the Legislature to require consideration of the practical value of assistance: s442B(3)(b). He contended that the actual conviction (concerning the offence at Leichhardt) was “assisted” by the respondent in the sense that cross examination of the respondent on his repudiated statement in the context of applicable Evidence Act provisions provided a factual resource of use to the prosecution. 
      
       
     18 The test to be applied by this Court is not governed by the actual outcome of any trial in which the offender has given evidence. As the extracts from the evidence above set out demonstrate, the testimony of the respondent was obstructive of the Crown case against Saltan and it is a distortion of language to describe his evidence as assistance to the Crown.  
      
       
     19 The respondent’s submission ignores the express terms of the undertakings which were, in each case, to give “evidence truthfully and frankly in accordance with” his statements identified above. 
      
       
     20 It can be noted that the jurisdiction of this Court is invoked in terms of the statute when the undertaking is wholly or partly unfulfilled. Short of not testifying at all it is difficult to conceive of a case where the failure to fulfil the undertaking was more complete than in the present. 
      
       
     21 Likewise there was a total failure to give the promised evidence at the second trial of Saltan. It was frankly conceded in a written submission by counsel for the respondent that his evidence was “of no assistance in the second trial”.  
      
       
     22 It was further submitted that the respondent’s entitlement to discount should be viewed in two aspects of assistance, past and future. The Crown, it was put, received benefit from the information contained in the two statements by the respondent. The discount received by the respondent and in respect of which s5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act is invoked was expressly related by the learned sentencing judge to the “promise to give evidence” which is manifestly future assistance. 
      
       
     23 It was pointed out that the discount assessed by the learned sentencing judge could be arithmetically calculated as approximately 20 percent of total sentence and it was submitted that this was “at the bottom of the range” with particular reference to the remark of Spigelman CJ in R v Chu NSWCCA unreported 16 October 1998 that the customary discount ranged between 20 percent and 50 percent. 
      
       
     24 Gibson DCJ did not find special circumstances justifying departure from the formula set out in s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 and stated that he considered that “the additional term is sufficient to establish his rehabilitation if it can be achieved”. It is submitted that this reflects an unduly narrow approach to the question of special circumstances: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534. Although his Honour made that finding the additional term which he specified did in fact exceed one third of the minimum term. (s 5(2) provided that the additional term must not exceed one third of the minimum term unless the Court decides there are special circumstances). 
      
       
     25 I acknowledge that special circumstances may be found where the respondent is resentenced pursuant to a successful Crown appeal. See for example R v Kama [2000] NSWCCA 23; R v Yucel [2000] NSWCCA 532. Nevertheless in this case where in my opinion the Crown appeal should be allowed for the purpose of restoration of a discount unjustifiably given, it would be inappropriate to find special circumstances arising out of the isolated circumstance that it was a Crown appeal. Nor am I persuaded that the circumstances otherwise lead to a finding of special circumstances in the context of sentencing legislation now applicable. 
      
       
     26 The learned sentencing judge limited his expression relating to the extent of discount for anticipated assistance to the minimum term component of his imposition. Currently applicable legislation (s44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) obliges the Court when sentencing an offender firstly to set the term of sentence and secondly to set a non parole period, so that any obscurity as to extent of discount such as might surround an indication relating only to one component of sentence as his Honour did, should not recur.  
      
       
     27 Counsel for the Crown has submitted that the new sentence should be imprisonment for twelve and half years, achieved apparently by addition of the two years mentioned by his Honour to the total term expressed by him, with a non parole period of nine and half years, presumably adding the equivalent years to the former seven and half years minimum term, treating minimum term and non parole periods as interchangeable. Current legislation includes:  
      
       
        
         
         “44(2) The non parole period must be not less than three quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the Court decides there are special circumstances for it being less, in which case the Court must make a record of its reasons for that decision.” 
         
        
       
     28 Nine and a half years is in fact more than three quarters of twelve and half years. The arithmetical ambiguity obviously arises from the circumstance that his Honour directed his attention and his assessment of two years discount only to the minimum term component of his imposition.  
      
       
     29 The offences by the respondent were serious. There is no need to recapitulate the circumstances which are adequately set out in the remarks on sentence at first instance. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that in the event of resentence this Court should pay heed to the length of sentence imposed upon a person of the youth of the respondent who was born on 21 July 1978 and who had, prior to the offence of robbery in company for which he was dealt with on the occasion in question, no prior convictions. As the sentence presently stands he would be liable to serve seven and half years prior to parole eligibility. It is also pointed out that his Honour did not give credit to the respondent for forty eight days in custody between 11 July 1997 and his release to bail on 7 August 1997. That period could be taken into account by dating any new sentence from 9 October 1997. 
      
       
     30 Finally, it was submitted that, if this Court determined that the respondent’s arguments were not sustained, it should in any event dismiss the Crown appeal as any increase in sentence would provoke a justifiable sense of grievance in the respondent by reason of the milder sentence received ultimately by Saltan for the robbery with wounding at Leichhardt following his conviction by the jury, namely ten years imprisonment with a non parole period of seven years. He was also sentenced to concurrent imprisonment for six months for larceny of a motor vehicle. 
      
       
     31 I intend to propose increase in the respondent’s sentence. Any sense of grievance related to Saltan’s sentence would not be objectively justifiable. Although Saltan supplied the knife and urged its use, if need be, it was the respondent who chose so to do and in a relative sense the respondent’s participation in a most serious element of the major offence was the greater. The respondent was also sentenced to concurrent imprisonment for a separate offence of robbery in company and the offence of robbery with wounding, common to him and Saltan, was aggravated in the case of the respondent by being committed whilst on bail for that other serious crime. 
      
       
     32 Giving such weight as is possible to any circumstances favourable to the respondent and, in particular, to remove any feeling engendered by what I have referred to as arithmetical ambiguity, I am of a view that a sentence of twelve years imprisonment should be substituted for the offence of aggravated robbery with wounding and a non parole period of nine years (being three quarters of that sentence) specified as the non parole period. I would give effect to the respondent’s submission concerning date of commencement. 
      
       
     33 Sentences imposed in respect of offences other than that to which I have just referred have expired and it is appropriate to vary sentence only for the count charging the offence mentioned. 
      
       
     34 I would make the following orders: 
      
       
        
       (1) Crown appeal allowed. 
        
       (2) Sentence imposed on 29 May 1998 for aggravated robbery with wounding quashed. 
        
       (3) In lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced, taking into account the matters on Form 1, to imprisonment for twelve years to commence from 9 October 1997 and I would specify a non parole period of nine years also commencing from that date.  
        
       (4) I would specify 8 October 2006 as the first date upon which the respondent would be eligible for parole.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 STEIN JA: This is a Crown appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences imposed on the respondent, Russell Geoffrey Francis, by Coolahan DCJ on 28 August 2001. 
      
       
     2 On the morning of the trial, 12 June 2001, the respondent pleaded guilty to two offences of detaining for advantage and causing injury in contravention of s 90A of the Crimes Act 1900. The charges concerned events occurring over the night and morning of 31 August and 1 September 2000. The two victims were a Mr Jeffrey Schott and Mr Andrew Tyler. There were two co-offenders, Jamie Forrester and Tiffany Brockman. 
      
       
     3 The sentencing of the respondent was completed on 28 August 2001 when the respondent was convicted and sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for 3 years from 24 August 2001, to expire 23 August 2004. His Honour found special circumstances and set a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 24 August 2001 and expire on 23 August 2002. 
      
       
     4 One of the co-offenders, Tiffany Brockman, had pleaded guilty on 13 June 2001. She was sentenced by his Honour to imprisonment for 2 years with respect to each count, suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act upon condition that she enter bonds to be of good behaviour for the period of the sentences. The respondent conceded that there was no question of parity between him and Brockman. 
      
       
     5 On 12 June 2001, the day fixed for trial, the accused Forrester failed to appear and a bench warrant was issued. The respondent, Francis, pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     6 With regard to the sentencing of the respondent his Honour accepted a statement of facts tendered by the prosecution. However, he added that: 
      
       
        
         
         … the full extent of the horror of the ordeal suffered by Schott and Tyler can only be gained by a perusal of their statements. It is obvious that, over a period of many hours, they were subjected to significant assaults at the hands of both Forrester and this offender (Francis) and that they feared for their lives. As I said, upon being assaulted by this offender, Tyler urinated in his pants. This was out of fear. On frequent occasions during the course of the ordeal Schott cried, also out of fear. 
         
        
       
     7 The victim Tyler’s statement indicates as follows:  
      
       
        
         
         - his increasing anxiety as he saw the doors locked; 
          
         - his utter fear as he witnessed the violence perpetrated on Schott and then suffered by himself such that he urinated in his pants as the respondent punched and elbowed him; 
          
         - his pain and fear during his “interrogation”, as he was hit with the baseball bat, and sheer terror at the realisation that he did not know what was to become of him; 
          
         - the threats that he was going to be thrown off a cliff or drowned, made all the more real by being taken to places where that could be achieved; 
          
         - his fear and belief that he was going to die, as he was dragged from the car and handcuffed, and then told to dig his own grave; 
          
         - his pain and fear during the further interrogation and continued physical assaults; 
          
         - the further vicious assault by the respondent who gave him his asthma puffer and then kicked him to the centre of the chest knocking him straight to the ground such that he couldn’t breathe and then vomited on the ground; 
          
         - the continued threats to kill and violence perpetrated upon their return to Forrester’s house; 
          
         - the continuing fear felt by him after his release, such that upon his return to his own house he showered holding on to a meat cleaver and a big knife and then sought the help and advice of his father, ultimately staying in a motel even after the matter had been reported to police; 
          
         - the physical injuries suffered including two black eyes, numerous lumps and bruises on his forehead and back of head, bruised rib and bruised lung, scratches to his neck, bruised wrist; 
          
         - his real fear that he was going to be murdered. 
         
        
       
     8 The victim Schott’s statement indicates that: 
      
       
        
         
         - after being punched in the nose by Forrester he saw the respondent hit Tyler’s head a number of times with his right fist and left elbow; 
          
         - he saw the respondent give Forrester the baseball bat, which Forrester then used to hit Tyler in the face; 
          
         - the respondent punched him to the right eye; 
          
         - his extreme fear during the interrogation and their confinement; 
          
         - the respondent dragged Tyler from the car and later kicked Tyler to the chest causing him to collapse, vomit and gasp for air; 
          
         - he was petrified of the respondent and Forrester; 
          
         - he was too fearful to stay at his home after the assaults; 
          
         - he suffered a broken nose, laceration, bruising, soreness and swelling to his face, neck and back. 
         
        
       
     9 His Honour found that while Forrester had the prime interest in detaining the victims, the respondent was prepared to very actively and violently assist Forrester in the commission of the offences. Further, the respondent’s drug dependence played a significant part in his participation in the offences. Francis was prepared to go along with Forrester or assist him in a very real way and engaged in prolonged gratuitous violence, some of which even Forrester did not encourage. While the offence by the respondent was not premeditated, the respondent became actively involved in the offences over many hours. Further, where there was any discrepancy between the victims’ statements and the respondent, the former were to be preferred. 
      
       
     10 His Honour said that the respondent willingly participated in a ‘reign of terror’ that the victims endured over many hours. While the involvement of the respondent was not as significant as that of Forrester, it was ‘certainly close to it’.11 The Crown contends that in stating that the pleas of guilty entered on the day of the trial ‘were timely’, his Honour took into account two irrelevant factors; threats by Forrester to the respondent and the respondent’s drug dependence. The Crown submits that while these factors may explain the late plea, they were irrelevant to a determination of the utilitarian value of the plea. This is because, whatever the respondent’s explanation was for waiting until the trial day to plead guilty, the prosecution was still required to prepare for trial, including the marshalling of witnesses. 
      
       
     12 The Crown further submits (and this is its primary submission) that the sentences imposes on the respondent were manifestly inadequate and that there was a failure to reflect the objective criminality involved in the offences when setting the non-parole period. It is submitted that the seriousness of the offences, as recognised by his Honour, did not translate into sentences which appropriately marked the seriousness of the respondent’s conduct, even acknowledging his subjective circumstances. Further, while it was within the judge’s discretion to find special circumstances and set a non-parole period of less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the seriousness of the offence, R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [63] per Spigelman CJ. The non-parole period of 12 months imposed by his Honour did not adequately or appropriately reflect the seriousness of the crimes. 
      
       
     13 Because I take the view that the sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly inadequate, it is unnecessary to consider the Crown’s submission relating to the timing of the plea and its discount value. There is no doubt in my mind, that taking account of the facts before his Honour and his Honour’s findings, the objective gravity of the respondent’s criminality was very high indeed. The sentence, and in particular the non-parole period imposed, did not adequately or appropriately reflect the degree of seriousness of the offences. See Power v The Queen (1973) 131 CLR 623 at 628 and, with regard to the non-parole period, Simpson mentioned above.14 The objective considerations include the maximum penalty for the offence, being 20 years; that there were two offences involving two victims; that the offences were committed in company thereby aggravating the offences; that the victims were fearful for their lives, Schott being reduced to tears and Tyler urinating in his pants and that the respondent brutally attacked Tyler at a time he requested his Ventolin and was having problems breathing. 
      
       
     15 I would endorse his Honour’s reference to the respondent willingly participating in a ‘reign of terror’ and that, although the respondent’s involvement was not as significant as that of Forrester, it was ‘certainly close to it’. 
      
       
     16 His Honour said that the offences were ‘extremely serious’. They were. However, his Honour did not appropriately mark the seriousness of the criminality involved, even giving full weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances. The sentences imposed did not reflect the criminality of the respondent. 
      
       
     17 In my opinion, the sentence can truly be said to be a manifestly lenient one, both with respect to the head sentence and the non-parole period. There was no element of general deterrence. Undue weight was given to the respondent’s subjective circumstances at the cost of not imposing a sentence which the gravity of the offences called for. 
      
       
     18 Error having been found the court needs to consider its discretion to intervene and re-sentence. 
      
       
     19 It is the submission of Mr Craigie SC, on behalf of the respondent, that if error be found by the court, the court should not intervene. He argues that more than one-half of the non-parole period has been served. Reliance is placed upon affidavits of the respondent, sworn 19 and 27 February 2002 attesting to his continuing progress in rehabilitation. Mr Craigie points to his Honour’s findings about the central part that the respondent’s problems with drugs and alcohol played in the offences. If his term of imprisonment is extended, his rehabilitation may be set back. Further, reliance is placed on the respondent’s relative youth he is now just 24 years of age. 
      
       
     20 During the addresses by counsel, the court drew attention to the 10 week delay by the Director of Public Prosecutions in filing the Notice of Appeal. The respondent was sentenced on 28 August 2001 and the Notice of Appeal was filed on 5 November 2001. The only reason advanced for the delay was the non-availability of the Reasons on Sentence. Indeed, they were still not available on 5 November 2001 when the appeal was lodged. This is unsatisfactory and is a further discretionary factor which works in favour of the respondent. In a case of manifest inadequacy such as this, there was no need to wait for the delivery of the transcript on sentence. 
      
       
     21 Taking full account of the double jeopardy in which the respondent has been placed, as well as the not insignificant subjective factors relied on by the respondent, the extreme seriousness of the offences leads me to conclude that the intervention of the court is warranted. The sentences plainly do not adequately reflect the high degree of criminality involved.  
      
       
     22 In re-sentencing, all of the respondent’s subjective factors are taken into account, in addition to the aspect of double jeopardy and the recent evidence provided by the respondent. Special circumstances are found to exist as outlined by his Honour the sentencing judge. 
      
       
     23 I would propose that the appeal be allowed and the sentences be quashed. In lieu thereof, the respondent should be sentenced to 4 years imprisonment on each offence, to be served concurrently. The sentence is to commence on 24 August 2001 and to expire on 23 August 2005. I would fix a non-parole period of 2 years to expire on 23 August 2003.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 O’KEEFE J: This appeal was heard on 6 March, 2002. On that date the Court made orders as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. Crown appeal allowed. 
        
        
       2. Existing sentence quashed. 
        
        
       3. Respondent, Charles Canino, sentenced to imprisonment for two years to commence on 6 March, 2002 and to expire on 5 March, 2004. 
        
        
       4. Respondent, Charles Canino, is to become eligible for parole on 6 December, 2002. 
       
      
      
       
       The Court advised the parties that the reasons for the above orders would be given on 8 March, 2002. Those reasons are as follows: 
        
       
     2 This is an appeal pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by the Crown against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 23 October, 2001 on Charles Canino (the respondent) on the basis that it was manifestly inadequate. The respondent had pleaded guilty to a charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug. The prohibited drug was cannabis. The amount involved was 17.3 kg. Its street value was $200,000. The maximum penalty provided for the offence is ten years imprisonment or a fine of 2000 penalty units or both.  
      
       
     3 The cannabis in question had been brought from South Australia, where it had been accumulated or stockpiled by the respondent for the purposes of satisfying an order which had been placed for New South Wales. The District Court Judge imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment, but suspended the execution of the sentence conditionally on the respondent entering into a good behaviour bond. 
      
       
     4 Other persons had been engaged in the enterprise which involved the bringing into New South of the 17.3 kg of cannabis for distribution in this State. One was a relative of the respondent (Gligora). Another was the driver of the truck in which the drugs were carried from South Australia to New South Wales. A third was a person by the name of Jamie Spagnol who had been responsible for transporting the respondent from Sydney (Mascot) Airport on 24 July, 1999 to a place of trans-shipment of the drugs at Casula. There Spagnol, under the eye of the respondent, loaded the 40 bags containing the drugs from the truck in which they had been carried from South Australia to his own vehicle, after which he drove off, but was arrested very soon after.  
      
       
     5 Spagnol was sentenced in the District Court to a period of two years imprisonment, but that sentence was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on the basis that he was regarded by the judge who sentenced him as merely a courier. The sentencing judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “From the material before me, I accept that his role in this offence was not … as an organiser or leader in this supply of cannabis but otherwise, in the role of courier.” 
         
        
       
     6 Furthermore, the sentence was imposed on the basis that Spagnol’s limited involvement in the enterprise was “out of a sense of desperation to pay off a relatively large debt … that he had run up with a bookmaker…”. In addition, in determining to suspend the sentence, the judge took into account that Spagnol remained in prison for approximately five weeks, and whilst in prison embarked upon rehabilitation which it was thought had good prospects of success but could not be continued if he had to serve a full time custodial sentence. That rehabilitation involved Spagnol in an intensive residential course at Odyssey House where he remained continuously from the time of his release on bail up to the time of his sentencing on 16 May, 2000. In effect, this meant that Spagnol had spent a period of some ten months either in custody or in a situation which had many of the characteristics of custody. 
      
       
     7 At the sentence hearing relating to the respondent there was evidence concerning Spagnol’s involvement. It was different from and additional to that which had been placed before the judge who sentenced Spagnol. Although Spagnol had been sentenced on the basis that he was a only a courier, the District Court Judge who sentenced the respondent came to the conclusion, on the evidence that was before him, that “Spagnol (was) not a mere courier with only a marginal connection to the operation.” 
      
       
     8 At the sentencing hearing relating to the respondent there was extensive evidence of intercepted telephone conversations between the respondent and one of his relatives. In those conversations, the respondent said that he was “getting things started”, that some of the material had “been sitting for a while” (indicating that the drug had been stored and may have deteriorated) and stated that he was “gonna find 60 good ones…” (meaning 60 bags of cannabis in good condition). In another phone call, the respondent reported that he was “getting organised” and that he would be seeing somebody later that day about obtaining further drugs to complete the quantity required for shipment. In yet another conversation he reported that “there’s 58 there” (meaning that he had on hand 58 bags of the drug) and that “I’ve gone through ‘em all” (indicating that he had inspected the drugs to ensure their quality). The telephone conversations recorded by police indicated that the respondent was concerned about the quality of some of the drugs that he had acquired. This is the effect of his statement that: “I get a bit worried about ‘em, but then I look at some and they’re fuckin’ beautiful right … and then I look at others and I think jeez is he gonna complain…” 
      
       
     9 Another intercepted phone call on 23 July 1999 reveals arrangements being made between Gligora, (the relative who was described as a principal), and the respondent concerning arrangements for Spagnol to pick up the respondent at Mascot Airport and for Gligora to give Spagnol’s phone number to the respondent. 
      
       
     10 The role of the respondent in relation to the drugs in question has to be understood against the background of the law of South Australia. In South Australia it is not a criminal offence to cultivate cannabis in relatively small quantities. This means that in order to accumulate a substantial quantity of cannabis it is frequently necessary to collect amounts of the drug from a number of sources. This may involve moving around from place to place, with the number of places visited being dependent upon the amount of drug at each particular place and the total amount to be accumulated. 
      
       
     11 The intercepted telephone conversations point to the respondent employing others in connection with the handling of the drugs. Thus on the afternoon of 23 July 1999, whilst discussing two additional and apparently unaccounted for bags of the drug, the respondent explained that he “had ‘em in separate piles, but one of the boys accidentally put two from that pile”. Later conversations the same day reveal that the arrangement for the delivery of 40 (“four-o”) bags of the drug were made, that the respondent was “getting organised” and wanted Gligora to inspect the drugs before they were shipped out. 
      
       
     12 From the foregoing it can be seen that the respondent played a significant role in the collection, accumulation, inspection, storing and shipping of the illegal drugs. He was no mere courier. His involvement was clearly deeper and more fundamental than that of Spagnol, even if Spagnol be regarded as more than a mere courier. This is further highlighted by the fact that the respondent travelled to Sydney and oversaw the transfer of the drugs from the vehicle that had brought them from South Australia into Spagnol’s vehicle, which was to be used as part of the distribution process. He waited for the money for the drugs so that he could presumably take it back to South Australia. 
      
       
     13 The respondent’s counsel submitted to the sentencing judge that there should be parity in the sentences imposed on the respondent and Spagnol. Indeed, his submission went so far as to say that the sentences should be the same. He argued in the District Court and before this Court that a disparity not permitted by law would arise if the respondent were to receive a custodial sentence rather than a suspended sentence of the kind that Spagnol had received.  
      
       
     14 The sentencing judge took the view that whilst a custodial sentence was indicated by virtue of the seriousness of the offence, and was supported by the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission, the onus of proving beyond reasonably doubt the difference between the roles of the respondent on the one hand and Spagnol on the other in the criminal enterprise had not been satisfied by the Crown. As a consequence he felt compelled by authority to impose a sentence on the respondent that was the same as that imposed on Spagnol. He did so virtually to the exclusion of all other considerations. In so doing, I am of opinion that the sentencing judge fell into error.  
      
       
     15 The principle of parity was dealt with by the High Court in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. Dawson J, with whom Wilson J agreed, summarised the principle as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “There is no rule of law which requires co-offenders to be given the same sentence for the same offence even if no distinction can be drawn between them. Obviously where the circumstances of each offender or his involvement in the offence are different ten different sentences may be called for but justice should be even-handed and it has come to be recognised both here and in England that any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not to be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of a grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done.” (at 623) 
           
          
         
        
       
      Gibbs CJ expressed the principle as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “The true position in my opinion may be briefly stated as follows. It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are no always equal, such matters as the age, background, criminal history and general character of the offender and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence have to be taken into account.” (at 609) 
           
          
         
        
       
      Brennan J said: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “The sentencing of co-offenders always requires a comparison of their conduct and antecedents. The imposition of comparable sentences upon co-offenders whose respective conduct and antecedents warrant disparate sentences is unjust. Similarly the imposition of disparate sentences upon co-offenders whose conduct and antecedence are comparable is unjust. A justified sense of unfair treatment is produced in either case. To facilitate the comparison of conduct and antecedence it is desirable that where practicable, co-offenders be sentenced by the same judge at the same time. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           As regards must be had to the comparative gravity of the conduct of co-offenders and to their respective antecedence, an appealable error is not shown by an offender who merely points to a lesser sentence imposed upon his co-offender. To say that an appellate court is bound to take the lesser sentence as the norm even though it is inappropriately lenient is tantamount to saying that ‘where you have one wrong sentence and one right sentence (the) court should produce two wrong sentences’ – a proposition that cannot be accepted.” (at 617) 
           
          
         
        
        
       Notwithstanding this last mentioned statement by Brennan J, Mason J took a different view. Where there is a case of discrepancy, he said that the correct approach is: 
        
        
         
          
           
            “… that a court of appeal is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance, by reducing a sentence, which is not excessive or inappropriate considered apart from the discrepancy, to the point where it might be regarded as inadequate.” (at 613-614) 
           
          
         
        
        
       However, he emphasised that the application of the principle should not be reduced to a formula or to rigid categories (at 611). 
        
       
     16 From these statements of principle it is clear that parity of sentencing was a relevant matter for the sentencing judge to consider in the present case. That did not involve the application of any rigid formula, but it did involve the necessity for the role which the respondent played in the commission of the offence to be carefully analysed and defined and then compared with the role played by his co-offender, Spagnol. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     17 In the present case the sentencing judge failed to analyse and define the role of the respondent. No reference is made by him in his remarks on sentence to the matters revealed by the intercepted telephone conversations in which the respondent had been involved. His categorisation of the respondent as other than a mere courier involves a negative. It tells what the respondent was not. It leaves the actual role of the respondent undefined. Absent such a definition the process of comparison called for by the High Court in Lowe cannot be undertaken. It was not adequately undertaken by the sentencing judge. To say that because Spagnol was more than a mere courier and that the respondent was also more than a mere courier their respective roles were comparable makes an assumption in relation to their respective roles and the characterisation of their involvement which is both unjustified and wrong.  
      
       
     18 The analysis by the sentencing judge of the actions of the respondent, to the extent that it was undertaken, commenced with the arrival of the respondent in Sydney on 24 July, 1999. In so doing he seems to have overlooked, and certainly does not refer to, the events involving the respondent that took place in South Australia prior to his leaving for New South Wales. Yet that material is quite pivotal to an assessment of the criminality of the respondent – an essential matter in any assessment of the comparative conduct of the co-offenders in question.  
      
       
     19 Clearly the role of the respondent in the criminal enterprise was greater, indeed significantly greater, than that of Spagnol. This of itself would be sufficient to preclude the application of the parity principle as a result of which the sentencing judge felt himself compelled to impose what he regarded as, and which clearly was, an inadequate sentence. If that were the only error it would be a sufficient basis for this court to intervene. However, there are further considerations which mandate intervention by this court to which I will now refer. 
      
       
     20 The actual comparison required by the principle of parity does not involve a rigid approach nor does it depend on a question of onus, let alone a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. The principle of parity is a manifestation of a consideration of justice that points to the imposition of comparable sentences on co-offenders whose conduct and antecedents are comparable. It requires a comparison by the court of the criminal conduct and antecedents of the co-offenders. If they are comparable, the principle applies. If they are not, it does not.  
      
       
     21 In the present case not only were the respective roles of the respondent and Spagnol in the criminal enterprise different, but so too were the subjective elements of each: 
      
       
        
       (a) Spagnol was only 26. The respondent was 40. 
        
        
       (b) Spagnol had spent some ten months either in custody or in compulsory residence at Odyssey House. Whilst this is not imprisonment, it is a real deprivation of liberty cognate to imprisonment. On the other hand the respondent had spent only 18 days in custody, namely the time between his arrest on 24 July, 1999 and his being admitted to bail on 10 August, 1999. 
        
        
       (c) A custodial sentence would have prevented Spagnol’s drug rehabilitation at Odyssey House proceeding to conclusion. The respondent had no such factor which operated in his case. 
        
       
     22 In fixing the sentence His Honour makes no mention of the question of general deterrence. Yet in a case such as the present that is an important factor. The offence committed by the respondent was objectively serious. It involved the bringing into New South Wales of a substantial quantity of an illegal drug for distribution in this State. It was a planned enterprise. It was an enterprise that involved the collection, accumulation, storage, inspection and transportation of the drug in question. The respondent was involved in each of these elements of the enterprise. The enterprise was conducted as a business. It is important that a clear message be sent to the respondent and to those others who may engage in like conduct that such conduct will attract severe penalties in this State.  
      
       
     23 In my opinion, conformably with authority, the case is one for the imposition of a custodial sentence on the respondent. That sentence, again conformably with authority, should be the least sentence that would have been imposed in the court below had the judge not fallen into the errors to which I have referred. In fixing such sentence the court needs to have regard to the time that elapsed between the plea of guilty and the primary sentencing as well as the time that has elapsed between the imposition of such sentence and the hearing of the present appeal. Furthermore, in determining the sentence regard must be had to the double jeopardy to which the respondent has been exposed as well as to the subjective or personal factors applicable to the respondent.  
      
       
     24 When regard is had to the foregoing factors, I am of opinion that it would not be appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years. And I do think that it would be appropriate to suspend any such sentence. It is important that this court indicate the community’s disapprobation of conduct of the kind in which the respondent engaged. The message needs to be clear that the bringing of drugs into New South Wales for distribution in this State will attract a custodial sentence.  
      
       
     25 In the present case there are, in my opinion, special circumstances which make it appropriate that the statutory ratio of non-parole period to the term of the sentence should be varied from that provided for in s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Some of the factors which lead to that conclusion have been adverted to paragraph 23 above. Another factor is that the respondent has spent the time between the date on which he was sentenced in the District Court and the date of hearing of the present appeal reporting in accordance with the conditions of his good behaviour bond. The fact that the respondent and his family ordinarily reside in South Australia whereas he will be imprisoned in New South Wales will render his term of imprisonment more stressful and hence more onerous for him also underpins the conclusion to which I have referred.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 O’KEEFE J: This appeal was heard on 6 March, 2002. On that date the Court made orders as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Existing sentence quashed. 
       
       
      3. Respondent, Charles Canino, sentenced to imprisonment for two years to commence on 6 March, 2002 and to expire on 5 March, 2004. 
       
       
      4. Respondent, Charles Canino, is to become eligible for parole on 6 December, 2002. 
      
     
     
      
      The Court advised the parties that the reasons for the above orders would be given on 8 March, 2002. Those reasons are as follows: 
       
      
    2 This is an appeal pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by the Crown against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 23 October, 2001 on Charles Canino (the respondent) on the basis that it was manifestly inadequate. The respondent had pleaded guilty to a charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug. The prohibited drug was cannabis. The amount involved was 17.3 kg. Its street value was $200,000. The maximum penalty provided for the offence is ten years imprisonment or a fine of 2000 penalty units or both.  
     
      
    3 The cannabis in question had been brought from South Australia, where it had been accumulated or stockpiled by the respondent for the purposes of satisfying an order which had been placed for New South Wales. The District Court Judge imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment, but suspended the execution of the sentence conditionally on the respondent entering into a good behaviour bond. 
     
      
    4 Other persons had been engaged in the enterprise which involved the bringing into New South of the 17.3 kg of cannabis for distribution in this State. One was a relative of the respondent (Gligora). Another was the driver of the truck in which the drugs were carried from South Australia to New South Wales. A third was a person by the name of Jamie Spagnol who had been responsible for transporting the respondent from Sydney (Mascot) Airport on 24 July, 1999 to a place of trans-shipment of the drugs at Casula. There Spagnol, under the eye of the respondent, loaded the 40 bags containing the drugs from the truck in which they had been carried from South Australia to his own vehicle, after which he drove off, but was arrested very soon after.  
     
      
    5 Spagnol was sentenced in the District Court to a period of two years imprisonment, but that sentence was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on the basis that he was regarded by the judge who sentenced him as merely a courier. The sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “From the material before me, I accept that his role in this offence was not … as an organiser or leader in this supply of cannabis but otherwise, in the role of courier.” 
        
       
      
    6 Furthermore, the sentence was imposed on the basis that Spagnol’s limited involvement in the enterprise was “out of a sense of desperation to pay off a relatively large debt … that he had run up with a bookmaker…”. In addition, in determining to suspend the sentence, the judge took into account that Spagnol remained in prison for approximately five weeks, and whilst in prison embarked upon rehabilitation which it was thought had good prospects of success but could not be continued if he had to serve a full time custodial sentence. That rehabilitation involved Spagnol in an intensive residential course at Odyssey House where he remained continuously from the time of his release on bail up to the time of his sentencing on 16 May, 2000. In effect, this meant that Spagnol had spent a period of some ten months either in custody or in a situation which had many of the characteristics of custody. 
     
      
    7 At the sentence hearing relating to the respondent there was evidence concerning Spagnol’s involvement. It was different from and additional to that which had been placed before the judge who sentenced Spagnol. Although Spagnol had been sentenced on the basis that he was a only a courier, the District Court Judge who sentenced the respondent came to the conclusion, on the evidence that was before him, that “Spagnol (was) not a mere courier with only a marginal connection to the operation.” 
     
      
    8 At the sentencing hearing relating to the respondent there was extensive evidence of intercepted telephone conversations between the respondent and one of his relatives. In those conversations, the respondent said that he was “getting things started”, that some of the material had “been sitting for a while” (indicating that the drug had been stored and may have deteriorated) and stated that he was “gonna find 60 good ones…” (meaning 60 bags of cannabis in good condition). In another phone call, the respondent reported that he was “getting organised” and that he would be seeing somebody later that day about obtaining further drugs to complete the quantity required for shipment. In yet another conversation he reported that “there’s 58 there” (meaning that he had on hand 58 bags of the drug) and that “I’ve gone through ‘em all” (indicating that he had inspected the drugs to ensure their quality). The telephone conversations recorded by police indicated that the respondent was concerned about the quality of some of the drugs that he had acquired. This is the effect of his statement that: “I get a bit worried about ‘em, but then I look at some and they’re fuckin’ beautiful right … and then I look at others and I think jeez is he gonna complain…” 
     
      
    9 Another intercepted phone call on 23 July 1999 reveals arrangements being made between Gligora, (the relative who was described as a principal), and the respondent concerning arrangements for Spagnol to pick up the respondent at Mascot Airport and for Gligora to give Spagnol’s phone number to the respondent. 
     
      
    10 The role of the respondent in relation to the drugs in question has to be understood against the background of the law of South Australia. In South Australia it is not a criminal offence to cultivate cannabis in relatively small quantities. This means that in order to accumulate a substantial quantity of cannabis it is frequently necessary to collect amounts of the drug from a number of sources. This may involve moving around from place to place, with the number of places visited being dependent upon the amount of drug at each particular place and the total amount to be accumulated. 
     
      
    11 The intercepted telephone conversations point to the respondent employing others in connection with the handling of the drugs. Thus on the afternoon of 23 July 1999, whilst discussing two additional and apparently unaccounted for bags of the drug, the respondent explained that he “had ‘em in separate piles, but one of the boys accidentally put two from that pile”. Later conversations the same day reveal that the arrangement for the delivery of 40 (“four-o”) bags of the drug were made, that the respondent was “getting organised” and wanted Gligora to inspect the drugs before they were shipped out. 
     
      
    12 From the foregoing it can be seen that the respondent played a significant role in the collection, accumulation, inspection, storing and shipping of the illegal drugs. He was no mere courier. His involvement was clearly deeper and more fundamental than that of Spagnol, even if Spagnol be regarded as more than a mere courier. This is further highlighted by the fact that the respondent travelled to Sydney and oversaw the transfer of the drugs from the vehicle that had brought them from South Australia into Spagnol’s vehicle, which was to be used as part of the distribution process. He waited for the money for the drugs so that he could presumably take it back to South Australia. 
     
      
    13 The respondent’s counsel submitted to the sentencing judge that there should be parity in the sentences imposed on the respondent and Spagnol. Indeed, his submission went so far as to say that the sentences should be the same. He argued in the District Court and before this Court that a disparity not permitted by law would arise if the respondent were to receive a custodial sentence rather than a suspended sentence of the kind that Spagnol had received.  
     
      
    14 The sentencing judge took the view that whilst a custodial sentence was indicated by virtue of the seriousness of the offence, and was supported by the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission, the onus of proving beyond reasonably doubt the difference between the roles of the respondent on the one hand and Spagnol on the other in the criminal enterprise had not been satisfied by the Crown. As a consequence he felt compelled by authority to impose a sentence on the respondent that was the same as that imposed on Spagnol. He did so virtually to the exclusion of all other considerations. In so doing, I am of opinion that the sentencing judge fell into error.  
     
      
    15 The principle of parity was dealt with by the High Court in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. Dawson J, with whom Wilson J agreed, summarised the principle as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “There is no rule of law which requires co-offenders to be given the same sentence for the same offence even if no distinction can be drawn between them. Obviously where the circumstances of each offender or his involvement in the offence are different ten different sentences may be called for but justice should be even-handed and it has come to be recognised both here and in England that any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not to be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of a grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done.” (at 623) 
          
         
        
       
      
     Gibbs CJ expressed the principle as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The true position in my opinion may be briefly stated as follows. It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are no always equal, such matters as the age, background, criminal history and general character of the offender and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence have to be taken into account.” (at 609) 
          
         
        
       
      
     Brennan J said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The sentencing of co-offenders always requires a comparison of their conduct and antecedents. The imposition of comparable sentences upon co-offenders whose respective conduct and antecedents warrant disparate sentences is unjust. Similarly the imposition of disparate sentences upon co-offenders whose conduct and antecedence are comparable is unjust. A justified sense of unfair treatment is produced in either case. To facilitate the comparison of conduct and antecedence it is desirable that where practicable, co-offenders be sentenced by the same judge at the same time. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          As regards must be had to the comparative gravity of the conduct of co-offenders and to their respective antecedence, an appealable error is not shown by an offender who merely points to a lesser sentence imposed upon his co-offender. To say that an appellate court is bound to take the lesser sentence as the norm even though it is inappropriately lenient is tantamount to saying that ‘where you have one wrong sentence and one right sentence (the) court should produce two wrong sentences’ – a proposition that cannot be accepted.” (at 617) 
          
         
        
       
       
      Notwithstanding this last mentioned statement by Brennan J, Mason J took a different view. Where there is a case of discrepancy, he said that the correct approach is: 
       
       
        
         
          
           “… that a court of appeal is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance, by reducing a sentence, which is not excessive or inappropriate considered apart from the discrepancy, to the point where it might be regarded as inadequate.” (at 613-614) 
          
         
        
       
       
      However, he emphasised that the application of the principle should not be reduced to a formula or to rigid categories (at 611). 
       
      
    16 From these statements of principle it is clear that parity of sentencing was a relevant matter for the sentencing judge to consider in the present case. That did not involve the application of any rigid formula, but it did involve the necessity for the role which the respondent played in the commission of the offence to be carefully analysed and defined and then compared with the role played by his co-offender, Spagnol. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    17 In the present case the sentencing judge failed to analyse and define the role of the respondent. No reference is made by him in his remarks on sentence to the matters revealed by the intercepted telephone conversations in which the respondent had been involved. His categorisation of the respondent as other than a mere courier involves a negative. It tells what the respondent was not. It leaves the actual role of the respondent undefined. Absent such a definition the process of comparison called for by the High Court in Lowe cannot be undertaken. It was not adequately undertaken by the sentencing judge. To say that because Spagnol was more than a mere courier and that the respondent was also more than a mere courier their respective roles were comparable makes an assumption in relation to their respective roles and the characterisation of their involvement which is both unjustified and wrong.  
     
      
    18 The analysis by the sentencing judge of the actions of the respondent, to the extent that it was undertaken, commenced with the arrival of the respondent in Sydney on 24 July, 1999. In so doing he seems to have overlooked, and certainly does not refer to, the events involving the respondent that took place in South Australia prior to his leaving for New South Wales. Yet that material is quite pivotal to an assessment of the criminality of the respondent – an essential matter in any assessment of the comparative conduct of the co-offenders in question.  
     
      
    19 Clearly the role of the respondent in the criminal enterprise was greater, indeed significantly greater, than that of Spagnol. This of itself would be sufficient to preclude the application of the parity principle as a result of which the sentencing judge felt himself compelled to impose what he regarded as, and which clearly was, an inadequate sentence. If that were the only error it would be a sufficient basis for this court to intervene. However, there are further considerations which mandate intervention by this court to which I will now refer. 
     
      
    20 The actual comparison required by the principle of parity does not involve a rigid approach nor does it depend on a question of onus, let alone a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. The principle of parity is a manifestation of a consideration of justice that points to the imposition of comparable sentences on co-offenders whose conduct and antecedents are comparable. It requires a comparison by the court of the criminal conduct and antecedents of the co-offenders. If they are comparable, the principle applies. If they are not, it does not.  
     
      
    21 In the present case not only were the respective roles of the respondent and Spagnol in the criminal enterprise different, but so too were the subjective elements of each: 
     
      
       
      (a) Spagnol was only 26. The respondent was 40. 
       
       
      (b) Spagnol had spent some ten months either in custody or in compulsory residence at Odyssey House. Whilst this is not imprisonment, it is a real deprivation of liberty cognate to imprisonment. On the other hand the respondent had spent only 18 days in custody, namely the time between his arrest on 24 July, 1999 and his being admitted to bail on 10 August, 1999. 
       
       
      (c) A custodial sentence would have prevented Spagnol’s drug rehabilitation at Odyssey House proceeding to conclusion. The respondent had no such factor which operated in his case. 
       
      
    22 In fixing the sentence His Honour makes no mention of the question of general deterrence. Yet in a case such as the present that is an important factor. The offence committed by the respondent was objectively serious. It involved the bringing into New South Wales of a substantial quantity of an illegal drug for distribution in this State. It was a planned enterprise. It was an enterprise that involved the collection, accumulation, storage, inspection and transportation of the drug in question. The respondent was involved in each of these elements of the enterprise. The enterprise was conducted as a business. It is important that a clear message be sent to the respondent and to those others who may engage in like conduct that such conduct will attract severe penalties in this State.  
     
      
    23 In my opinion, conformably with authority, the case is one for the imposition of a custodial sentence on the respondent. That sentence, again conformably with authority, should be the least sentence that would have been imposed in the court below had the judge not fallen into the errors to which I have referred. In fixing such sentence the court needs to have regard to the time that elapsed between the plea of guilty and the primary sentencing as well as the time that has elapsed between the imposition of such sentence and the hearing of the present appeal. Furthermore, in determining the sentence regard must be had to the double jeopardy to which the respondent has been exposed as well as to the subjective or personal factors applicable to the respondent.  
     
      
    24 When regard is had to the foregoing factors, I am of opinion that it would not be appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years. And I do think that it would be appropriate to suspend any such sentence. It is important that this court indicate the community’s disapprobation of conduct of the kind in which the respondent engaged. The message needs to be clear that the bringing of drugs into New South Wales for distribution in this State will attract a custodial sentence.  
     
      
    25 In the present case there are, in my opinion, special circumstances which make it appropriate that the statutory ratio of non-parole period to the term of the sentence should be varied from that provided for in s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Some of the factors which lead to that conclusion have been adverted to paragraph 23 above. Another factor is that the respondent has spent the time between the date on which he was sentenced in the District Court and the date of hearing of the present appeal reporting in accordance with the conditions of his good behaviour bond. The fact that the respondent and his family ordinarily reside in South Australia whereas he will be imprisoned in New South Wales will render his term of imprisonment more stressful and hence more onerous for him also underpins the conclusion to which I have referred.

       JUDGMENT 
       
       
     1    DOWD J: I have read the judgment of Smart AJ in draft form. I agree with the proposed orders and with his Honour’s reasons.2    GREG JAMES J: I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment of Smart, AJ. I agree with the orders proposed and his Honour's reasons for those orders.3    SMART AJ: Mr K T Mandagi appeals against his conviction on 8 March 2000 after a trial extending over 28 days, of between about 1 August 1998 and 14 October 1998 at Grants Beach, North Haven and elsewhere being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to heroin (s.233B(1)(d) Customs Act 1901).  He also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 25 years commencing on 14 October 1998, the date of his arrest.4    The appellant complains of the judge's directions as to knowledge and lies and the lack of a comprehensive direction as to circumstantial evidence. The heroin the subject of the offence weighed 252.3 kilograms with the gross weight of the 1132 compressed blocks of white powder being 3.99 kilograms. This was the largest importation of heroin as at 14 October 1998,5    The appellant, who was the captain of the Uniana which brought the heroin from the Andaman Sea near the Thai-Burma border to the Port Macquarie district of Australia, was tried jointly with Janis Thoefilus Paluh, the second officer and Henki Lucky Rumuat, the second engineer. The jury were unable to agree on a verdict in respect of Paluh and Rumuat. The three men were represented by the same counsel at their trial.6    The Facts About 3.30am on 14 October 1998 a speedboat carrying 31 black sports bags in which the heroin was packed landed at Grants Beach, near Port Macquarie. The three men aboard the speedboat (2 Chinese and an Indonesian) were immediately arrested by agents of the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The driver of the speedboat, a Chinese national named Chi Keung Chan (Chan) pleaded guilty to being knowingly concerned in the importation, rendered assistance to the Authorities and undertook to give evidence for the Crown, thus receiving a reduced sentence. He later gave evidence in the trials of others involved in the importation.7    At the time the heroin was landed on Grants Beach a vessel known as MV Uniana was holding a position about twelve nautical miles off the Australian coast. This vessel was under the captaincy of the appellant. About 4.30 am a Customs vessel asked the Uniana to acknowledge the authority of the Australian Customs Service by stopping its forward movements. Over the next thirty minutes after initially not responding to the Customs’ instructions the Uniana responded by asserting that it was in close (to the Australian coastline) by reason of bad weather and was on its way to New Zealand. The Crown alleged that the appellant radioed that response.8    With the approach of an Australian warship and a Customs vessel the Uniana changed its direction and made its way to Port Macquarie. At 7.30am it was boarded by AFP and Customs officers and detained. The appellant, an Indonesian, and ten Indonesian crew members under his command were arrested along with a Chinese man who had remained on the Uniana.9    So far as is known the Uniana, at some unspecified time prior to its arrival outside port limits of Hong Kong Harbour about 10 August 1998, had been modified to equip it as a smuggling vessel capable of travelling long distances. There were three large fuel tanks under deck and a fresh water tank. A chamber between the water tank and one of the fuel tanks was constructed as a void space with a valve capable of flooding the chamber with sea water. The valve had recently been installed. The speedboat used to ferry the heroin was also housed in a specially adapted cradle underdeck in what would otherwise have served as the cargo hold. Whilst outside port limits of Hong Kong Harbour modifications had been made to the derrick located on deck to facilitate lowering and raising the speedboat into the sea under load.10    For six weeks prior to 10 August 1998 the appellant and his crew had been aboard the vessel On Shun, which was also anchored outside port limits of Hong Kong. The Crown alleged that the appellant and his crew were awaiting the arrival of the Uniana. The appellant claimed that he had been told in mid-July 1998 that the On Shun was to be sold and that he was awaiting further advice from the owners. In the meantime he directed the crew to clean and paint the ship. He said that he did not receive his monthly pay of $HK11,000 during the period but his diary showed that he had been in receipt of bonus payments from at least May 1998. On 17 August 1998 the equivalent of $HK50,000 was paid into the appellant's bank account.11    On 14 August 1998 the appellant boarded the Uniana with his crew from the On Shun except the Chief Engineer whom the appellant claimed was ill. There was evidence that the Uniana already had an engineer who had been attending to modifying the derrick. In cross-examination the appellant said that he did not ask the people who had arranged the transfer of the crew who would be paying for the journey, what cargo would be carried or as to the vessel's destination. He did nothing to satisfy himself of the seaworthiness of the Uniana or its fuel and water capacity for the journey ahead before leaving Hong Kong. He said that he learnt the intended destination of the Uniana and the purpose of the voyage moments before the vessel's departure on the afternoon of 15 august 1998. That was when Chan and Khong Hoi Lau (also known as Ah Lung) boarded the Uniana. The appellant claimed that it was Chan who told him that the vessel was to sail to about the Thailand-Burma border where at sea (the Andaman Sea) they were to collect a wealthy man and take him to Australia where he would be smuggled ashore. He knew that this was illegal, but he did not inform his crew of the fact.12    The appellant said that the first time he knew of the secret compartment beneath where the speedboat was stowed was when he saw the video (after his arrest) with Mr McKenzie walking over the ship and telling of its capacities. (T446)13    The appellant said that he had no knowledge at any time of the void space under deck and no knowledge that by opening the sea valve the chamber would flood to a level equal with the draught of the vessel. The Crown contended that this was fanciful given the appellant's captaincy of the small vessel. The Crown relied upon the practical necessity of the appellant as captain satisfying himself as to the suitability and capacity of the vessel for the journey and entries in his diary which showed some degree of forward planning for a journey to Australia.14    The Crown alleged that the appellant was in possession of a false entry certificate in his name into Manila Harbour at the time he left Hong Kong Harbour and that this was part of a plan to falsify the ship's log as to the route taken and ports of entry en route. The appellant maintained that he and his officers falsified the log to conceal that an illegal immigrant had been collected at sea. He said that he only commenced to falsify the log after being informed the purpose of the journey was to smuggle a person into Australia. The Crown alleged that the appellant first participated in the plan to falsify the log by creating false entries as to the anchorage of the Uniana in Hong Kong on 14 August 1998 before departing from there. This evidence made it hard to accept that the appellant had only been informed of the journey's purpose and destination moments before leaving Hong Kong. The log did not show the Uniana leaving Hong Kong until 11 September 1998. The Crown asserted that the appellant knowingly created and maintained a false log and directed others to do likewise in order that the true passage of the Uniana to the region of Thailand and Burma to collect the heroin and to take on fuel and water at Singapore be concealed.15    In his remarks upon sentence the judge said: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""Throughout the voyage [the appellant] had falsified the log so that nowhere does the voyage to the Andaman Sea appear. Documents found on board, several of them forged, show him as the captain on a voyage from Manila Harbour to New Zealand post dated approximately a month after he sailed from Hong Kong. The log had in fact, quite contrary to what he told the jury, been falsified from the first day. The Uniana had never been nearer Hong Kong Harbour than the outer port limits and no record of it being there exists, yet in the log it is recorded as sailing from within the port of Hong Kong.""  
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
     16    About 5 September 1998 the Uniana was in international waters off the coast of Burma and Thailand and remained there awaiting contact from another vessel. Instructions were received from time to time via the satellite telephone by Chan or Lau and ultimately communicated to the appellant. After eventually receiving instructions by telephone about the arrival in the area of a particular vessel, the speedboat was, on 15 September 1998, lowered into the sea at the appellant's direction and driven by Chan to another vessel nearby. Lau accompanied him. The blocks of heroin then in rice sacks were transferred from this other vessel to the speedboat and thence to the Uniana. Chen Wei Ming (Chen) (also referred to as Man Chai) boarded the speedboat and accompanied Chan and Lau back to the Uniana. The appellant supervised the reloading of the speedboat with an additional gross weight of almost 400 kilograms. The entire procedure took place at night under torchlight. All this took place many miles from the coast in the Andaman Sea17    The appellant gave evidence that he saw sacks in the speedboat but did not know how many there were and did not make any inquiries as to the contents of the sacks or where they were stowed on the Uniana at the time they were taken aboard. He said that he believed they were the personal possessions of the man who was being smuggled. He also gave evidence that he later believed the bags or some of them contained gold jewellery having been told that by Chan en route to Singapore. He claimed no knowledge of the fact that the contents of the sacks were repacked into sports bags and thereafter housed in the void chamber under deck where they remained until they were loaded back into the speedboat off the coast of Australia. 18    After loading the heroin the voyage continued down the Kra Isthmus, through the straits of Malacca to Singapore where the Uniana was refuelled at sea, when by pre-arrangement, a bunkering lighter came out from Singapore to meet it. The Uniana then proceeded without again stopping, except to lower the speedboat to test the engine, towards its final destination at Port Macquarie.19    On the evening of 12 October 1998 the loaded speedboat was lowered into the water under torchlight. There were no lights on the ship. The venture had to be cancelled due to bad weather. The speedboat was raised and repositioned on the Uniana. According to Mr Chan, the appellant was in the wheelhouse. 20    Fei Lo Nam (Nam), who was directing the operation from overseas gave Chan a position from which they should launch the loaded speedboat on 13 October 1998. This was conveyed to the appellant.21    Mr Chan said that during that day the appellant gave him a position to which he should go to meet the Uniana after unloading the heroin on shore from the speedboat. Around 9pm the lights on the ship were turned off and under torchlight the loaded speedboat was lowered into the sea. The weather was still severe but not as bad as the previous night. However, on the journey to the shore the weather conditions worsened and the speedboat lost radio contact with the Uniana. The journey to Grants Beach took about six hours.22    The Crown relied on the lies which the appellant had allegedly told in his police interviews. The Crown alleged that the accounts which the appellant gave about his involvement in the voyage to Australia were false and given with a consciousness of his knowing involvement in the heroin importation. In his record of interview of 15 October 1998 the appellant told the police that he was at all times after leaving Hong Kong subject to the direction of the Chinese men who organised the cargo and to whom he referred as ""super cargo"". He said the cargo was picked up at sea together with another Chinese man and it was at that time in sacks shaped like bales of rice sacks. The cargo was taken down into the cargo hatch by the three Chinese men. He asked them what the goods were as there were no documents but they did not want to say. When he tried to follow them down into the cargo hold, he was told that it was none of his business. The absence of documents made him suspicious and this was compounded by his being told that it was none of his business. His suspicions were further compounded by his being told sometimes that it was fish food, sometimes that it was gold dust and their sometimes laughing at him saying it was a joke He claimed that when the cargo was loaded into the speedboat he still did not know what was in the bags into which the cargo had been placed.23    In the record of interview of 19 October 1998 the appellant said that upon leaving Hong Kong Harbour he was directed by the Chinese men to sail to the Thai-Burma border and, after arriving there and waiting for some days, he was told by the Chinese man that goods would be taken on board. When the cargo was taken on he thought it was food. He did not know what was in the rice sacks but he was told it was fish food and that he did not need to know as it was none of his business. When the speedboat was off-loaded off the coast of Australia he was suspicious because he was asked to stop where there was no proper port. He was conscious he was travelling at all times without direction other than where the Chinese men told him to travel and that this was unusual.24    When the speedboat was launched on the evenings of 12 and 13 October 1998 the appellant claimed that he only saw that it contained a plastic container and a blue plastic bag. He denied seeing any black travelling bags.25    In both interviews he told the police that the ship did not stop or draw to port after taking the cargo on board because the ship was fully fuelled and had adequate fuel and water on leaving Hong Kong. He did not mention the refuelling and taking on water off Singapore.26    In his evidence the appellant departed from both these accounts. He said that he was aware before leaving Hong Kong that he was to travel to an area near the Thai-Burma border to collect an escapee and his belongings, and to thereafter transport him to Australia where the escapee would be smuggled ashore. The Crown alleged that the appellant did not tell the police that he believed he was involved in smuggling a person and his valuable personal possessions to Australia because this was also false. The person smuggling account was adopted by the appellant after service of the prosecution brief containing a statement from Chan in which Chan claimed he was recruited as a speedboat driver to smuggle a person into Australia. The judge effectively invited the jury to disregard this aspect of Chan's evidence (SU 15 of 29/2/00) as the Crown did not rely on it.27    In his remarks upon sentence of 14 March 2000 the judge at pp3-4 commented as to the lies: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              ""He told a number of lies on arrest which were conceded as lies when he changed his story for the purpose of this trial. He told police that he did not know what had been brought on board in the Andaman Sea, but to thejury he said that he did know and that it was an illegal immigrant and his baggage. To the police he had said that his destination was New Zealand but that had been changed whilst he was at sea. To the jury he said that he had always known that the ship was bound for Australia. How he came to be on the Uniana was also an admitted lie. He told police the ship did not stop between the coast of Burma and Australia when it stopped for bunkering in Singapore. By way of excuse for these lies he said that he feared the death penalty was in force in Australia and because he had always known the journey was to pick up a Chinese national with his luggage, now that the luggage was, to his horror, exposed as heroin he would be held to account. 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              The second story was no more believable than his first. What came on board was seen by him to be fifteen rice sacks, hardly to be described as the luggage of a rich man. His account of his last month on the On Shun, painting and repairing a ship he had been told was to be scrapped was simply not to be believed. When transferred to the Uniana he asserted that he knew neither his pay nor his destination, nor his cargo, nor the ship's condition nor its safety, nor its provisions, nor its owners. Never had a captain set to sea so ill informed."" 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     28   The judge noted that the appellant had a strong economic motive. He was in dire financial circumstances at the time he came on board. The additional pay he received and sent home would have helped.29   The appellant relied on the evidence which disclosed planning and organisation of the importation from at least April 1998 and Chan's active involvement in various phases of that planning. Chan claimed that he believed that he would be involved in the smuggling of a person into Australia. Chan flew to Sydney in June 1998 and was driven to the mid North Coast where he assessed what would be a suitable boat and chose a suitable location for landing it by sea.30   The appellant pointed out that the Crown initially described Chan as a very important witness. By the end of the trial the Crown did not regard Chan or his evidence as significant. Some of his evidence was untruthful. The judge remarked at SU 15 of 29/2/00: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
               ""As to knowledge the Crown says that Chan's evidence is patently open to criticism, and he obviously lied to minimise his involvement. But the Crown only rely on him in part, namely the delivery of the heroin to the ship, its stowage on the Uniana and its delivery to Grants Beach. As to the rest of it, the Crown says it may be an interesting and discursive account of events, but they do not rely on that."" 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     31   Counsel for the appellant noted that Chan's evidence of these incidents was largely not in dispute and thus added little to the Crown case.32   The appellant also pointed to his reply when asked by the AFP who was the boss. The appellant answered that he was the captain. He was asked again, ""No, who is the boss, the Chinese man?"" The appellant indicated the man known as Ah Lung. (aka Khong Hoi Lau). He boarded the Uniana just before it left the outer port limits of Hong Kong.33  The Defence Case 
      
      In his evidence the appellant said that at the time of the trial he was a 42 year old married man with a seven year old son. He had no prior convictions. He had held the rank of captain since 1982 and mastered 16 vessels. He had been on the On Shun since May 1998. Towards the end of July or early August 1998 the agent told him the ship may be sold. As at 14 August 1998 the sale of the vessel was confirmed and the appellant demanded back pay for 2½ months at $HK12,000 per month. The rest of the crew did likewise. Indonesia was in political chaos and there was no prospect of a job from home. He accepted an offer to transfer to another ship. He and the crew were paid their back pay. The entire crew previously on board the Uniana were leaving because of a dispute about pay. (This was also the fact on the Crown case). The area of transfer (Hong Kong Outer Port Limits) was a legitimate anchoring point for commercial vessels, with a multitude of other vessels and patrolling by the Hong Kong Authorities The appellant and the crew (except the Chief Engineer) transferred to the Uniana that day. Chan was present on the On Shun during the discussions. The appellant had not seen him previously.  
     34   On board the Uniana, Frankie, the agent, introduced the appellant to Mr Poon (who existed and was intimately involved on the Crown case). The appellant said that Poon told him that maybe they would sail to New Zealand in international waters and that during the course of the journey there would be two or three persons coming along, one of whom was experienced as the captain of a fishing boat. The appellant heard Poon and Frankie whispering about the nature of the enterprise. The appellant was told that someone would come on board and explain. Chan directed him to set sail on 15 August 1998 for the Thailand-Burma border and advised that they were to collect, at sea, a wealthy Chinese escapee and his belongings (which he was told were expensive goods) and take them to Australia where the escapee would be smuggled ashore. The appellant denied that he knew of the secret compartment underneath where the narcotics were stored below deck. He did not inspect or handle the goods brought on board by the Chinese man and was not allowed to by the Chinese super cargo (and the Crown did not suggest otherwise). Normally the engineer inspects the engine and the fuel tanks. (The engineer had been appointed earlier by the agent). It was the appellant's experience that normally on boarding there would be a ""general arrangement"" diagram derived from the chart of the vessel. Such a document was not available on the Uniana.35   The appellant stated that he, the first officer and the second officer had made entries in the ship's log and those between 15 August and 24 September 1998 were false because of his awareness of the illegality of the trip, the certificate in the vessel (as to entry into Manila Harbour) and a note with it saying if possible to fill the log in according to that certificate. The appellant's co-accused gave evidence that he had seen this note.36   The appellant explained that the amount of money transferred into his account comprised 2½ months back pay at $HK12,000 per month and itemised loans from crew members, details of which were provided to Frankie on 14 August 1998. The co-accused, Paluh supported the appellant's account of the loan to him. The receipt was provided by Frankie who came on board when the vessel stopped to refuel off Singapore. Chan gave evidence of such an occurrence and that $HK12,000 per month was lower than a captain of the appellant's standing could expect to receive legitimately. Chan also said that Nam had directed him during the course of the trip to tell the crew that they would get a month's bonus because of the length of the voyage. The appellant confirmed that he and the others had been told of this and that he had received a bonus of couple of weeks pay on other trips he had undertaken.37   On the evidence adduced it appeared that while the crew of the Uniana assisted the lowering and raising of the speedboat anything to do with the rice sacks was left to and carried out by the three Chinese men.38   It was the appellant's case that at no time did he know or believe that the cargo in the rice sacks received on board in the Andaman Sea was heroin. He stated that he believed that the goods received in the rice sacks were expensive goods belonging to the escapee. The appellant's counsel stated the issue in the trial was whether the appellant had the requisite knowledge. This was the only element of the offence not conceded. Before turning to the submissions as to this, the question of lies will be considered.39   Appeal Ground 2 reads: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
               ""The Crown's reliance on lies as evincing a consciousness of guilt, and the trial judge's directions regarding the same, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice."" 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     40    At SU13-14 of 29/2/00 the judge gave these directions as to lies: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
               ""Now there have been, the Crown maintains, a number of lies told to investigating officers which the Crown puts forward to indicate in an accused a consciousness of guilt. However, people lie for many reasons. Innocent people can lie. A person may be embarrassed. He may be fearful, and he may lie because he can see no other way out of the situation at that stage, yet need not have done what is alleged of him. There are many many reasons why people tell lies and we have all had experience of this. It is, therefore, necessary that lies told to an investigating officer, or in court, must be demonstrated by the Crown as being told for the sole purpose of deflecting the police investigation, if they are used to show a consciousness of guilt, or to, as it were, deflect your considerations.  
               
              
             
             
              
               
               There are four matters which the Crown must demonstrate to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt, before you can regard a lie as being told in the consciousness of guilt. First of all, there has got to be an assertion of fact, contrary to the truth. That must be deliberate. It must relate to a material issue, that is an important issue in the case. And it must be told solely from the motive of the realisation of guilt, and the fear of truth emerging in relation to the offence. Only where there can be no other reason to tell lies, but to stop the truth emerging, because of the realisation of guilt, can you use lies as demonstrating consciousness of guilt. 
               
              
             
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     41   In response to a question from the jury, the judge gave these directions the following morning at SU 32-33 of 1/3/00: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              ""Lies told to an investigating officer may be seen by you to indicate in an accused consciousness of guilt. However, people lie for a number of reasons, they might lie out of panic, they might lie to escape an unjust accusation, they might lie just to deflect the accusation coming their way in the hopes that it will go somewhere else, even though they be innocent. So you must understand to start with that people tell lies for a variety of reasons, all of which we, as rational human beings understand.  
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              It is therefore necessary that lies told to an investigating officer must be demonstrated by the Crown as being told for the sole and only purpose of deflecting the police investigation if they are to be used as a demonstration of guilt. 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              There are four matters which the Crown has to demonstrate to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt before you can regard a lie as being told in the consciousness of guilt. First of all, there has got to be an assertion of fact, contrary to the truth. It must be deliberate and it must relate to a material issue, one that is an important issue in the case and it must be told solely from the realisation of guilt in the teller and the fear of truth emerging in relation to the offence. 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              Only when there can be no other reason to tell lies but to stop the truth emerging because of the realisation of guilt can you use that lie as demonstrating consciousness of guilt. That is why 'no' is only the short answer to your question. 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              If Mr Mandagi is lying for the sole purpose of distancing himself from his involvement with the voyage to decrease his chances of being found guilty but not necessarily because he knew narcotics were on board, the answer is the jury obliged to use this as proof of guilt?'  
              (sic – ‘question’?) 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              The answer to that is no. The only time that you can use it as assistance in the Crown case is if you are satisfied that it was told with the sole purpose of stopping the truth emerging because he realised he was guilty and then you can use it to assist the Crown case."" 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     42   The judge next identified the lies upon which the Crown relied. The appellant contends that most if not all the lies should not have been left to the jury as capable of adding to the Crown case by evincing a consciousness of guilt and that with all of the lies there was no adequate direction in terms of the appropriate factors to take into account in determining the four matters.43   The appellant made these further submissions: 
      
       
        
        (a) In any case where a lie is relied upon to prove guilt the lies should be precisely identified as should the circumstances and events that are said to indicate that it constitutes an admission against interest:  
        Edwards  
        (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 210-211. Such circumstances and events were not identified by the judge. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The essential directions that the jury must be satisfied that the relevant statement was untrue and deliberately so were rendered nugatory by the judge's failure to refer to the evidence which was said to show such deliberate untrue statements. The appellant submitted that there was no clear evidence of the statements being untrue and deliberately so. Objection was taken to the judge's comment - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               ""His defence to all of this is that he would be held responsible merely because he had captained the ship holding the Chinese person and he was fearful of the death penalty."" 
              
             
            
           
          
         
          
        
       
      This was an over-simplified account of why he had told the various lies. 
      
       
        
        (c) A number of the lies did not relate to material issues and no explanation was provided as to how any of the lies could relate to material issues. 
         
         
        (d) The jury was not told that lies standing alone cannot, of themselves establish that the accused is guilty of the offence charged. 
         
        
       
     44   At T89 of 2/3/00 there was a discussion between the judge and counsel for the appellant. Counsel said ""Well, they'll have no trouble, they're admitted lies."" In his remarks on sentence (P3 of 14/3/00) the judge referred to the appellant conceding that he had told a number of lies on his arrest. In his evidence in chief when asked if he had told the police the truth during his two police interviews, the appellant replied, ""No, I made a bit of lie"" (T410). He also said that he did not tell the police about stopping at Singapore or the person smuggling venture. In cross-examination (T414) the appellant agreed that he did not tell the police the truth when they spoke to him on 15 October 1998. He agreed (T415) that he told them lies about his involvement in the Uniana's journey to Australia. He said ""I lied to the police after the police told me about that red speedboat carrying heroin."" At T417 he agreed that he lied to the police on 15 and 19 October 1998 because he feared he might be liable for the death penalty for smuggling. He instanced other countries in the region where he believed it was imposed and thought Australia would also do so. At T457 he agreed that he believed if he told the police the truth he would be in trouble. In view of the concessions and admissions made the judge was able to proceed on the undisputed basis that the appellant had told lies to the police on 15 and 19 October 1998. However, the admissions by the appellant that he had told lies were general in their terms. The prosecutor took the appellant in cross-examination to particular alleged lies. The appellant contended that as to many of the alleged lies relied upon by the Crown there was no express admission that they were untrue. The judge identified for the jury the alleged lies on which the Crown relied (SU 33-38) thus: 
      
       
        
        (1) On pp 16 & 17 of his record of interview of 15 October 1998 the appellant said that he did not know what the cargo was and that someone told him it was fish food. His evidence was that he knew it was an illegal trip to take a rich Chinese man to Australia. The Crown while not accepting the second statement which it alleged was also a lie, relied on the second statement pointing up that the first statement was a lie and evidenced a consciousness of guilt. 
         
         
        (2) On pp25 & 26 (Q95) the appellant stated that the Chinese men told him firstly to sail to New Zealand but in the end they told him to come close to Australia. In his evidence the appellant said that he had always been told that the journey was to go to Australia. (See T380 - course plotted on charts led to Australia, T383-4, T385, T429).  
        
       
       
        
        (3) On p.53 (Q185) the appellant stated that he was suspicious because they (the Chinese men) would not tell him what the goods were. [The appellant had also said that he was suspicious because there were no documents - the judge did not mention this. The appellant asked what he could do in the circumstances] 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           He told you (the jury) now that he knew what the goods were and he says that they were the belongings of the rich Chinese man. The judge added that it was no part of the Crown case that this was correct but that was a lie he told the police to deflect them. [In his evidence the appellant said that he was told that the Chinese man would ""take along"" his personal belongings, which were expensive goods. The appellant said that he believed these were expensive goods; gold jewellery was indicated. The appellant was not sure that the Chinese men were telling him the truth]. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) Question 190 (p54) - the appellant answered that ""a friend had offered me (or told me) about this job."" That was a lie because he was transferred with the rest of his crew from the On Shun. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) Question 16 of interview of 19 October 1998 - the appellant answered that the Chinese man on board the Uniana told him to wait and take on food in the Andaman Sea. According to his evidence he always knew what the voyage was for and that they were waiting to take on, as he says now, a rich Chinese man with his belongings. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Question 211 [did you consider you were carrying drugs] - the appellant answered ""we did not think what the things were"". [This is a paraphrase]. He also said to the police that he had been told that it was fish food [but he added that this was said jokingly]. The judge continued, ""now he maintains to you that he does know, or did know, what the goods were. They were the possessions of the rich Chinese man."" 
        
       
       
        
        (7) Question 219 - [where did you stop between Burma and Australia] - the appellant answered that they did stop. The judge continued, ""You have not only his evidence but you also have the evidence of the agreed facts in which it has been agreed and has been put before you that the Pegasus Venture went out and met the Uniana and commenced to supply diesel oil."" 
        
       
     45   While the judge was identifying the alleged lies on which the Crown relied the jury had copies of the transcripts of the two records of interview. Thus the judge did not have to summarise the questions. I have added a little detail, known to everyone at the trial, to facilitate understanding of the judge's summary.46   After so identifying the alleged lies the judge said (SU.36): 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               ""They are the lies which the Crown would rely on  
               ... 
               Mandagi's] defence to all of this is that he would be held responsible merely because he had captained the ship holding the Chinese person and he was fearful of the death penalty."" 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     47   At SU.38 the judge explained: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              ""If you are of a view that those explanations are reasonable, then you cannot of course use those lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and in this case that really amounts to guilty knowledge. That of course is a matter entirely for you to determine."" 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     48   The judge immediately asked counsel for the appellant and his co-accused whether there was anything counsel would wish him to add or subtract. Counsel did not ask the judge to add or subtract from his directions as to the appellant.49   In the course of summarising the evidence and putting the appellant's case in reasonable detail to the jury. The judge reminded the jury: 
      
       
        
        (a) The appellant said that he did not tell the police about the rich Chinese man he had brought to Australia because he was confused. His mind was ""miserable"" [after what he had been told by the police]. If he had told the police and been honest with them he would have further involved himself. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) He was arrested in the early hours of 14 October 1998, had brought the ship down to Sydney and had not had very much sleep when the police interviewed him and the record of interview was made. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) He did not see clearly that there were black bags in the boat that went to the Australian shore because it was very dark. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The appellant and his co-accused had been misled by a cunning, well organised and ruthless cartel. The cartel operated on a need to know basis and the accused would not have been told truthfully what cargo the ship was carrying. If the ship or the captain and crew were apprehended the less they knew, the less they could tell. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) The accused ""lied to the police for a number of reasons. They were foreigners in a strange country. They realised that something had seriously gone wrong, when the ship was arrested, and they were told to lie down on the deck. They were told that heroin in large quantities had been imported from that ship and they were frightened that they were going to be sentenced to death. For this reason they wished to distance themselves from any involvement in that enterprise, and that is why they told the police the lies they did. Overall it was obviously a very wealthy syndicate."" The crew however could be sacrificed and what they were told was that they were people smuggling. ""Their motives were merely to, as it were, save their own lives, and they told these lies not in the consciousness of guilt, but out of terror."" 
        
       
       
        
        (f) In the appellant's case the fear had been compounded. He asserted that he had been told by a police officer that two persons had died in this kind of operation. 
        
       
     50   The judge also outlined the Crown's submissions as to lies. The Crown contended that the account of the accused that they were only told that they were going to pick up this rich man and his luggage only occurred after they had spoken to the police and that the jury were hearing this version for the first time.51   The judge referred to a series of factors (SU.79-80 and referred to earlier) which the Crown claimed demonstrated that the explanation given in Court was utterly untrue, and that the real reason for the lack of concern as to the cargo being carried was that the appellant sought to distance himself at every turn from the quality of the real enterprise. The judge noted the further Crown claim that there was no real explanation as to why the accused did not tell the police the story which they now told the jury. The judge also noted the Crown assertions that the appellant received a significantly higher salary for the journey in question than would be usual and that he had told specific lies to the police.52   There was evidence of each of the lies relied upon by the Crown when a comparison is made with what the appellant said to the police in the two interviews and the evidence which he gave. It was not disputed that lies had been told to the police. The thrust of the defence case was that there was a credible explanation why they had been told. The appellant was terrified and wanted to avoid being put to death. The appellant, by his counsel elected to rely on that rather than contend that he had not lied. In some instances it was beyond argument that deliberate lies had been told. In others, the jury were entitled to take the view that deliberate lies had been told. The jury were correctly told what the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt before the Crown could rely on the lies as evidencing consciousness of guilt. The judge also directed the jury that only where there can be no other reason to tell lies but to stop the truth emerging because of the realisation of guilt, could the jury use lies as demonstrating consciousness of guilt.53   In the circumstances of the present case including that there was no dispute that the appellant had told lies, the identification of the lies, the nature of the response of the appellant, and the judge's outline of the competing arguments, the directions given were adequate. More was not required. This ground of appeal must fail.54   No relevant objection was taken to this portion of the summing-up at the trial despite adequate opportunity to do so including the specific invitation of the judge earlier mentioned. There were sound reasons for the appellant to urge the jury to accept his response of terror and lack of sleep, both of which were readily understandable and and not to embark upon a detailed analysis of what was said. Leave to argue this ground of appeal should be refused.55   Appeal Ground 1 reads: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              "" 
               the trial judge's directions regarding knowledge, for the purpose of knowing concern in the importation, were erroneous."" 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     The appellant submitted that the Crown case as to his knowledge that heroin was being imported as distinct from a person being smuggled into Australia was entirely circumstantial and that it was not clear and never explained how the factors relied upon by the Crown supported the conclusion that he knew (or believed) that heroin was being imported and that smuggling a wealthy Chinese man into Australia was not a reasonably possible explanation. 
     56   The judge explained what knowledge meant and how it could be proved at SU10-13: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              ""Knowledge however to make the involvement criminal need not alone be knowledge gained from direct observation. Direct knowledge gained from observation, knowledge gained by being told or by reading or an awareness of the likelihood in the sense that there is a significant or real chance that the enterprise involved the importation into Australia of drugs are all to be regarded as knowledge for the purpose of this section. 
              
             
            
           
           
            
             
              
              You know you have locked your keys inside your car when your slam the door and see them in the dashboard. You know you have locked your keys in your car when someone comes and tells you that you have done that because they have looked and seen the keys in the dashboard. And you know that there is a reasonable likelihood of your having locked your car keys in your car when you come back from the supermarket to the parking place and you have not got the keys with you and you know you have not put them down anywhere. Now that is a reasonable likelihood or a significant chance. All of that wide spectrum is knowledge for the purpose of this Act. But you must bear in mind that it is the knowledge in an accused person which must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown. Not what you would have known, or the reasonable person would have known, or the reasonable sailor on board the Uniana would have known, but the knowledge that can be attributed to these three individuals, separately. 
               
               
              Proof of knowledge, unless a person says that he knows something, is to be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the action in question. These may be physical circumstances, being at a particular place at a particular time, being in possession of certain objects, being in possession of certain skills and experience, and they may be actions proximate in time to the event itself. They may be actions contrary to good practice of a person with particular skills. 
               
               
              You must be satisfied of each of the facts upon which you rely, and which the Crown relies to substantiate knowledge. 
               
               
              If I can give you a little example of the kind of process through which you go. If you are sitting in your lounge room at home and the light goes out there may be four reasons for that to have occurred. It may cross your mind that the bulb has blown. It may cross your mind that there has been a power cut. It may cross your mind that the fuse has blown, or it may cross your mind that something has gone wrong with the wiring in your house. If you go outside to the next room and turn the light on and that functions, then obviously there is not a power cut. You can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that. Let us suggest that you go to the kitchen to get a new bulb and you put that in to the socket in the lounge room and it still does not work, you satisfied yourself beyond reasonable doubt that it is not the bulb that has blown. You go out to the fuse box but all the fuses are intact, so you satisfied yourself beyond any reasonable doubt that it is not a fuse problem. So the only thing that remains is that something has gone wrong with the wiring. Let us suppose you call an electrician in, in the morning, and he comes down with a burnt out piece of wire and shows it to you. You are not surprised by that because, having cut off every other alternative, that is the only one that is left. And it is in this way that you approach the evidence when it comes to knowledge. You should look to the evidence of facts proved to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt, and the inferences that can be drawn from those facts. You need not put aside a fact because it does not, of itself, disclose knowledge. You may keep it in the total number of facts that you are examining. And if looked at in total they point to an accused having knowledge to a requisite degree, and can bear no other rational inference, then you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the person was knowingly concerned in the importation. 
               
               
              It is the duty of the Crown to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that knowledge is the only rational inference, that there is no other rational explanation, but that each of the accused had knowledge."" 
               
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     57   The appellant submitted that as the Crown had not relied upon ""wilful blindness"" the direction as to ""significant or real chance"" as an alternative to either direct observation or being told of the likelihood of heroin being on board was erroneous. It was further submitted that the car key analogy was confusing, tended to reverse the onus of proof and was inappropriate to the circumstances of the case. Counsel for the accused asked that it be withdrawn.58   It is necessary to recall how the Crown case was put. The Crown contended that it had established that the appellant knew when he left Hong Kong that narcotics were to be imported into Australia because he was privy to the pre-planning necessary for such a venture. The Crown, both further and in the alternative contended that it was sufficient that the appellant knew at the time he left Hong Kong that he was embarking on an illegal venture of some considerable dimension and that later, either when the heroin was taken on board and/or off-loaded, he knew that it was a narcotics importation in the sense that by that time he had a positive belief in the likelihood, that is, that there was a real or significant chance, that narcotics were involved. The Crown submitted that as its case on knowledge was capable of being put in this way the judge's directions were flawless. The Crown also submitted that the use of the car by analogy to exemplify deductive reasoning was apt where what was being considered was proof of actual knowledge sourced otherwise than from what a person saw or was told.59   The judge at SU.30-31 in answer to the jury's question explained that the ""knowing concern"" could arise at any time throughout the voyage to Australia, providing there had been assistance in some part of the enterprise with the requisite knowledge. It could arise at the beginning, middle or end of the voyage.60   In the circumstances of the present case the car key analogy or illustration was appropriate and exposed the various ways in which knowledge could be obtained. It did not tend to reverse the onus of proof which the judge explained to the jury. The alternative and further way of putting the Crown case was permissible and combined comfortably with the third section of the illustration. The judge emphasised that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt the knowledge that could be attributed to the appellant.61   The appellant complained that the jury was not given a circumstantial evidence direction and that the judge's light bulb analogy was the closest the summing-up came to such a direction. The appellant had submitted to the judge that if that analogy was to stand the judge should answer the question which the jury asked: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              ""Does significant chance or reasonable likelihood mean the most reasonable alternative in the accused's mind or a reasonable alternative. For example using your light bulb analogy at what point does the person establish there is a reasonable likelihood that the problem is the wiring, is it when the light goes out and that is established as a reasonable possibility after the other options have been investigated and discluded.""  
                
              [sic - discarded?] 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     The judge replied (SU.31-32): 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
             ""I told you yesterday that knowledge may come to a person in a variety of ways. It may come to a person through direct observation or being told or having a belief that there is a significant chance or reasonable likelihood. They are gradations as it were of knowledge. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
             It has to be the knowledge in each or any of these accused persons and it has to be a positive belief in a reasonable likelihood. It has to crystallise into that stage. It would have to be a positive belief in an accused that there was a significant chance that what was in the hull or what was being unloaded was narcotic goods. Nothing short of that can found a conviction."" 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     The judge asked each counsel whether they wished him to add or subtract anything. It was not suggested that he should. 
     62   The judge did not answer the jury's questions directly. He did not further discuss the light bulb illustration. Instead he directed the attention of the jury to the principles which should guide them. That was prudent. The penultimate and last sentences from the passage last quoted were directly in point and of much assistance to the jury. I reject the complaint that the judge should have dealt with the jury's questions in a different fashion.63   I return to the complaint that the judge did not give a circumstantial evidence direction. In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 578 Dawson J, with whom Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed, pointed out that sometimes a circumstantial evidence direction may be necessary to enable the jury to go about their task properly but he added, ""... there is no invariable rule of practice, let alone of law, that the direction should be given in every case involving circumstantial evidence. It will be for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether it should be given."" Dawson J referred with approval to these remarks of Barwick CJ speaking for the Court in Grant v The Queen (1975) 11 ALR 503 at 504: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
             ""...Where the circumstances of the case seem to require that some such direction be given, the summing up regarded as a whole may prove to be, and generally may be likely to be, inadequate. On the other hand, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the nature of the summing up, the failure to give the special direction may not in a particular case result in an inadequacy of the summing up as a whole. It may none the less be concluded from the terms of the summing up that the jury were fully instructed. 
             "" 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     64 The Crown relied on the following circumstances in support of its case on knowledge: 
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) The appellant was on board the On Shun outside port limits in Hong Kong Harbour for six weeks prior to the arrival of the Uniana in receipt of monthly pay plus bonuses. 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) The appellant's evidence that he transferred from the On Shun to the Uniana without making any enquiries about the journey to be undertaken is implausible 
           
           
          (c) The appellant's evidence that he made no inspection of the Uniana upon boarding her, or for the 24 hours prior to departure, and therefore had no knowledge of the existence of the speedboat in its specially designed cradle under deck, or the void chamber is implausible. The competing inference is that he was aware of the existence of the speedboat and the lack of any cargo but was unable to innocently account for it. 
           
           
          (d) Admiralty charts were taken from the On Shun to the Uniana, at least one of which displayed part of the east coast of Australia. 
           
           
          (e) On 17 August from Hong Kong the Appellant transferred HK50,000 to Indonesia. His explanation that he borrowed this money from other crew members is unacceptable, given the shared plight of their economic circumstances as Indonesian nationals. 
           
           
          (f) The existence amongst the ship's documents of a 'Clearance of Vessel to Foreign Port' Certificate to Manila Harbour on 10 September 1998 in the name of 'Captain Krist T J Mandagi', together with the ship's log reporting an entry that the Uniana set sail on 11 September from Hong Kong to Manila. 
           
           
          (g) The appellant's participation in the preparation and maintenance of a false log of the ship's journey inclusive of false entries on 14 August, the day before the ship departed Hong Kong and the day before he claims to have been told of the person smuggling venture. 
           
           
          (h) The fact that two Hong Kong nationals joined the Uniana outside port limits to accompany the Uniana on its journey 
           
           
          (i) The fact that these same men boarded a speedboat in international waters off the coast of Burma and Thailand (in bad weather and under cover of darkness) and returned with another Chinese man and 15 rice sacks with a weight just under half a ton. 
           
           
          (j) The appellant's evidence that he did not see that there were a large number of sacks in the speedboat, or make any enquiries at the time as to what was contained within the sacks in the circumstances was implausible. The competing inference being either that he knew that narcotics had been collected because he had been told or because he knew in the sense of it being reasonably likely that it was so. 
           
           
          (k) The fact of oil and water being taken on board outside port limits at Singapore. 
           
           
          (l) The offloading of the speedboat off the east coast of Australia, together with two of the Chinese men and cargo now consisting of 31 black sports bags. The appellant's evidence that he did not see the large number of black bags covering the floor of the speedboat is implausible given his supervision of the offloading of the speedboat on two successive nights. The competing inference is that such a large number could not readily be explained as containing gold jewellery and reflected the fact that he knew that narcotics were being offloaded because he had been told of that fact or because he knew in the sense of it being reasonably likely that it was so. 
           
           
          
         
        
       
     65   These matters appear in the course of the summing-up. The judge emphasised that the Crown had to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and as earlier mentioned that for the appellant's involvement in the importation to be criminal the concern had to be knowing, that is, he had to know the nature of the undertaking. The judge explained what ""knowledge"" meant in the context in question. As appears from the lengthy directions quoted the judge further explained that proof of knowledge was to be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the action in question. Indeed as appears from the latter part of the quoted directions the judge said that when they considered the question of knowledge the jury should look to the evidence of facts proved beyond reasonable doubt and the inferences that could be drawn from those facts. At SU3 he had explained what an inference was. 
     66   The judge continued that if the facts in total pointed to an accused having knowledge to a requisite degree and could bear no other rational inference then the jury would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that person was knowingly concerned in the importation. The judge added that it was the duty of the Crown to satisfy them that there was no rational explanation other than knowledge. This made the position clear. A circumstantial evidence direction would have been redundant.67   The judge subsequently summed up the facts which led to an inference of knowing concern and the accused's case in reply.68   On examining the summing-up and the circumstances it is to be concluded that the absence of a circumstantial evidence direction does not result in the summing-up as a whole being inadequate. The jury were adequately instructed. As Dawson J remarked in Shepherd at 579, ""It will generally be sufficient to tell a jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence."" In the present case the jury were instructed to this effect. The complaint based on the absence of a circumstantial evidence direction fails.69   The appellant submitted that in drug charges the Crown is required to prove knowledge of the relevant quantity beyond reasonable doubt and relied upon CWW  (1993) 70 A Crim R 517. The appellant accepted that a belief falling short of actual knowledge, if proved beyond reasonable doubt, sufficed. CWW related to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. This is not the occasion to reconsider  CWW as the High Court of Australia has authoritatively determined in  Cheng v The Queen [2000] 203 CLR 287 that knowledge of the quantity of narcotic goods involved in the importation was not a necessary ingredient of the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of narcotic goods. This leads to the rejection of the appellant's submission.70   The Crown case was a very strong one, the defence was unbelievable and conviction was inevitable. The appeal against conviction fails.71   SentenceThe appellant submitted that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and that it was outside the permissible range. Further, he contended that there were these discrete errors in the sentencing process: 
      
       
        
        (a) failing to consider the role in the enterprise played by the appellant. 
         
         
        (b) failing to find that (or even consider whether) the appellant's role was less culpable in the enterprise than Chan's. 
         
         
        (c) imposing a life sentence where he had (by not considering the role played) postulated the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime. 
         
         
        (d) the sentence contravened the principles of parity when compared with that imposed on Chan. This was exacerbated by the judge failing to consider (or adequately consider) the appellant's role. 
         
        
       
     72   In his remarks on sentence the judge stated the circumstances which must have been accepted by the jury beyond reasonable doubt as to the offence. The amount of heroin powder weighed 389 kilos and contained 252 kilos of pure heroin. Its wholesale value was estimated to be seventy seven million dollars and its retail value six hundred and five point five two million dollars.73  The judge noted that the jury had rejected the appellant's claim that he did not know the nature of the cargo being carried. He was present on the bridge of the Uniana when it came aboard in rice sacks at night by torchlight in the Andaman Sea off the Thailand-Burmese border after a wait of many days and when it left the Uniana at sea at night by torchlight off the coast near Port Macquarie. Throughout the journey the appellant falsified the log so that there is no entry of the voyage to the Andaman Sea. Documents found on board, several of them forged, show him as the captain on a voyage from Manila Harbour to New Zealand. The documents were post-dated about a month after he sailed from Hong Kong. The judge noted the conceded lies told by the appellant. The judge found that the appellant's second story as to the rich Chinese escapee coming aboard with his luggage was no more believable than the first. The judge also found that there was a strong economic motive for the venture. 74   The judge recorded that the appellant was 42 years old and married with one son. He was a Christian by faith but married to a Muslim. The events have shattered his family and his wife and child have now been ostracised by both communities. The Indonesian economy was in a state of collapse and this led him to become involved. The judge recorded the submission that the appellant had gained little from this enterprise and far less than Chan.75   The judge rejected the appellant's submission that he was only a worker. The judge held that to attempt to build a hierarchy or company structure of a criminal enterprise such as the present one, without the slightest evidence, was to visit a world of conjecture. The judge made this finding: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""It is more to the point to say that this was a well planned, efficiently executed, criminal enterprise and of those involved who are amenable to the Australian justice system Mandagi was a pivotal figure and as such must bear much of the responsibility. Whether or not he received an amount commensurate with the risk he took is also not to the pint. It was a crime of massive proportion and he was deeply concerned in its commission."" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     The judge held: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""I have no doubt that only a harsh penalty will deter him. I have considered adequate punishment. The previous antecedents have already been set out and taken into consideration. It is quite possible he may be rehabilitated, although he appears as yet incapable of grasping the principle that there is, in a crew ( 
            sic) 
             of this nature, no division of moral responsibility. He still appears to see the importation as no concern of his. There is no doubt that a sentence imposed here will have a severe effect on the prisoner's family, he being the only source of income."" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     76   The judge accepted the Crown's submission that only a life sentence was appropriate but that a non-parole period should be set. The Crown has also submitted that if the Court considers that there are others ""more deeply involved” than the appellant, then while his role and that of Chan differed, they were indistinguishable in real terms and the appellant should be sentenced on the same basis (26 years with a non-parole period of 20 years) without the discount for assistance. 
     77   Counsel for the appellant addressed the judge extensively on parity and the Crown had it in mind in its submissions. The judge did not deal with the submissions as to parity. 
     78   Counsel submitted that the judge should have addressed ""more finely"" the role of the appellant and evaluated where he stood in relation to the organisation for which he committed the offence. It was submitted that there was evidence available as to the appellant's level of relative involvement in the enterprise and that it should have been taken into account especially as a life sentence was being contemplated. The appellant also submitted that the reasoning of the sentence imposed on the appellant demonstrated an erroneous methodology in that it almost presumed that where a large (or, perhaps very large) quantity of prohibited narcotic was involved a sentence of life imprisonment follows. That was to attach undue importance to quantity which is only one of a number of factors.79   It was submitted that the maximum penalty should be reserved for the worst type of case and that this was not such a case.80   The appellant submitted that, even on the Crown case the organisers of the enterprise were based in Hong Kong (or perhaps China). They provided directions to and kept in communication with Chan throughout the voyage. They organised for the transfer of the Indonesian crew from the Ah Shun to the Uniana on 14 August 1998. On the Crown case, Chan's associate, Ah Lung who was on board the Uniana, and sharing the captain's quarters with him, had $HK18 million pass through his accounts within less than a year prior to the importation. Counsel submitted that the appellant was part of a cheap compliant Indonesian crew whose maritime skills were used by those who organised, and stood to gain by the importation. This submission is probably correct. Counsel contended that the appellant was low in the hierarchy of the organisation. That is not the touchstone given the important role played by the appellant. 
     81   It was submitted that the appellant’s role was in sharp contradistinction to a person closely concerned with an organisation which provided the chain through which the goods would pass from their initial cultivation and preparation to their destination on the Australian market. It was also a role objectively less serious than that exercised by someone in a position such as Chan, who exercised quasi initiative and control although on the case most favourable to Chan, still subject to the direction of those above him. 
     82   While the role of Chan was an important one and he exercised executive and directing functions, the role of the appellant was also important. As the judge remarked the appellant had a pivotal role and the venture depended on his skills and seamanship in being able to manage his crew, sail safely for long distances through troublesome areas and arrive in international waters off Port Macquarie. Effectively, he had to do all this while taking orders from Chan and Ah Lung. While the criminality of the appellant was high, it falls short of the worst case. 
     83  While the appellant should have stoutly resisted the temptation to become involved, he faced the problems of lack of other employment and financial difficulties. The Crown accepted that the appellant had no relevant criminal antecedents. 
     84   The Crown correctly submitted that it was not essential for the trial judge to identify the precise nature of the appellant's involvement for sentencing purposes: R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 277, para 13. The judge rejected the appellant's account of how and when he became involved and that he was merely a worker. There was little by way of objective and reliable information as to those matters but it does seem reasonably clear that the appellant effectively had to do and did what he was told by his Chinese masters. This does not preclude protests by the appellant. It was not suggested that they interfered in matters of seamanship and the general management of the crew. They did however dictate the course taken by the ship and to the extent of supplying the co-ordinates of the positions to be taken up and arranging for the Uniana to be re-fuelled at sea. 
     85   The Crown submitted that it was sufficient for the judge to consider the level of responsibility the appellant assumed for the collection and safe transport of the heroin to Australia as expressive of his role. These were important matters to be considered but they have to be set against the background facts which emerge with reasonable clarity from the evidence. The Crown submitted that the judge was justified in describing the appellant as a pivotal figure in a well-planned and efficiently executed criminal enterprise. The judge put the matter slightly differently. He said that of those involved who are amenable to the Australian justice system the appellant was a pivotal figure and as such must bear much of the responsibility. Many drug ventures extend across a number of countries and involve people from different countries. In assessing criminal responsibility attention has to be focussed on what each person did and his responsibilities or lack of them. Some of those involved may not be amenable to the Australian justice system theoretically or practically. Neither a person's criminality nor his punishment should be elevated merely because the principals are not so amenable and that person is. Similarly, the person who is amenable should not bear more than his true share of responsibility. I am not sure exactly what the judge was meaning to convey by the remarks under consideration.  
     86   The appellant had an important role and it was pivotal to the extent that his task was to ensure the safe transport of the heroin. There was no evidence suggesting that the appellant had anything to do with the purchase of the heroin, its delivery to the speedboat in the Andaman Sea or its distribution in Australia or with any executive functions. 
     87   The Crown submitted that there was nothing in the judge's remarks to suggest that he gave undue weight to the quantity of heroin involved. The judge rightly referred to the quantity and its value in his remarks but those facts were not given undue weight in the judge's stated reasons. 
     88   The Crown submitted that it was incorrect to regard the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of twenty five years as the maximum penalty and reserved for the worst case. The effective maximum penalty under the statute is life imprisonment with no non-parole period. The Crown pointed out that such a sentence was imposed in another trial on two co-offenders, namely the other two Chinese men aboard the Uniana whose criminality was regarded as more culpable than that of the appellant and about whom it could be said that there was an absence of matters mitigating the seriousness of the crime.  
     89   ParityOn 14 October 1999, consequent upon a plea of guilty, Chi Keung Chan was sentenced to thirteen years imprisonment with a non-parole period of ten years. The judge took as a starting point, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence, a sentence of thirty-six years imprisonment. He continued: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""No remissions are in force in New South Wales and in accordance with the provisions of section 16G the sentence is reduced by ten years to one of twenty six years. I would set a non-parole period of twenty years. Applying the discount of ten per cent for past assistance and plea and forty per cent for future assistance particularly in regard to the undertaking, which he has given the Crown, the sentence imposed is one of thirteen years imprisonment and a non-parole period of ten years."" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     The judge intimated that he would have imposed a sentence of twenty-three years and six months with a non-parole period of eighteen years but for the future assistance.  
     90   In sentencing Chan, the judge after reviewing Chan's change of stories from that given on 14 October 1998 to that given in March 1999, said: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""A combination of these two accounts supports the following findings of fact. (1) The prisoner was employed for one journey. (2) He was to be paid in a sum certain for his part in the enterprise. (3) He brought to the enterprise special skills as a speed boat driver and navigator. (4) He purchased items such as wet suits and goggles. (5) He brought on board the co-ordinates for the rendezvous at the Thai/Burma border. A piece of paper with these co-ordinates on them he had received from Fei Lo Nam. (6) He was never without money because he appeared to have outlaid cash for fares, goods and equipment purchased and was reimbursed 10,000 Hong Kong dollars. (7) He was required to negotiate with the captain who was becoming impatient at the delay at the rendezvous at the Thai/Burma border. (8) He reported the safe arrival of the cargo but apparently was to take orders from Man Chai, who had come on board with the packages, as to their proper stowing. It was clear in the conversations that Fei Lo Nam knew the layout of the ship precisely. (9) He took instructions from Fei Lo Nam and kept him informed. 
            "" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     And: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""It is difficult to determine with precision his position in the hierarchy of this enterprise, firstly, because he has to be believed and this is difficult and secondly, because the relationship between the captain and those who either owned, purchased or transported the heroin is not clear."" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     91   After weighing a number of factors the judge rejected the Crown contention that Chan was a delegate of the owners while the heroin was on board and determined to regard Chan: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""As a specialist employed for one trip only with reporting duties but with no greater decision making role than the performance of his duties to load and unload the heroin ..."" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     92   Chan was an experienced Chinese fisherman who had worked as a trawler captain. He said that he was a very experienced sailor and navigator. He was engaged as an accomplished speedboat driver and to perform other tasks in what he knew was an illegal enterprise. The judge rejected the submission that any calculation of sentence should have as its starting point life imprisonment and that any discount could be used in the calculation of a non-parole period. The judge held that the importation of such a large quantity of heroin by the sophisticated and well organised techniques employed warranted life imprisonment. He also accepted Chan's submission that ""his position was not, of those amenable to the criminal law of the Commonwealth the most serious."" The Judge added: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""It is necessary to look to those others amenable to the criminal law in this country to determine those most deeply involved and giving the prisoner the benefit of the doubt, he is not that person or one of those persons."" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     93   The materials before the judge included a statement by Chan on 19 March 1999. Allowing for some or much of it not being true it reveals that in April 1998 Chan sought work from Fei Lo Nam (Nam) knowing that it may involve smuggling people. Chan said that Nam, whose headquarters were in mainland China, told him that he had a vacancy for a speedboat driver and that he needed someone to take a very important person and his possessions to Australia. Chan was told: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""...you will be taking one person and some precious luggage from a small boat to a big boat and then later take them to Australia. You will be paid $300,000 and I can give you $50,000 now."" 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     Nam did so and said that he could give Chan another fifty thousand Hong Kong dollars if Chan needed it. Nam inquired if Chan spoke Mandarin. Chan recommended Ah Lung.  
     94   Nam stated that he would contact Chan when there were further developments. Nam instructed Chan to buy a mobile telephone for himself and one for Nam and some phone cards including sim cards in another name. Chan was told never to purchase anything in his own name. Chan caused the cards and the mobile phones to be purchased, advised Nam, who arranged for them to be collected and Chan to be reimbursed. 
     95   Chan stated that in early June 1998 Nam instructed him to go to Australia to look at some beaches to see if they were suitable to get a speedboat ashore. He would be met at Sydney Airport. Chan arranged for a visa and Nam caused arrangements to be made for airline tickets. Chan collected and paid for them. They included one night's accommodation in Sydney. Chan flew from Hong Kong to Sydney. Fei Chai met him, took him to his hotel and the following morning drove him to the Port Macquarie area. Fei Chai took Chan to three separate beaches. Chan considered the first beach he saw to be the most suitable and another one to be suitable. Fei Chai took a recording from a hand held Global Positioning System (GPS) and made notes. They stayed at a local motel. Fei Chai received calls on his mobile telephone (up to 3 or 4 each hour). They returned to the beach which Chan had nominated as most suitable on two more occasions, one at night and one during the day and assessed if the conditions were any different and to observe high and low tides. Fei Chai paid for everything in cash.  
     96   On his return to Hong Kong Chan reported to Nam, who told him that the job would be done next month, that Chan's job was to drive the speedboat and that Ah Lung was to take care of the satellite telephone on the boat. Nam undertook to organise some special travel permits for Chan and Ah Lung and Chan gave Nam a passport photograph. Nam advised that they would be on the boat for two months and requested Chan to obtain medicines for the trip to take on the boat. Nam gave Chan a further fifty thousand Hong Kong dollars. 
     97   About 12 August 1998 Nam instructed Chan to buy three wetsuits, three life jackets, three pairs of goggles and some torches for the trip. He did so, except that he could only purchase two pairs of goggles. Nam, Ah Lung and Chan had dinner together that night. Nam gave a new contact pager and mobile telephone number for himself to Chan and instructed him: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""Give these co-ordinates and frequencies to the interpreter when you get on the boat, he will need to give them to the ship’s captain. … when you get to these co-ordinates call ‘Man Chai’ on the radio and someone will respond.”  
            
           
          
         
        
       
     98  Nam handed Chan a piece of paper containing all the details including the number of the satellite telephone on board the ship. Pursuant to instructions from Nam, Chan and Ah Lung put the 3 diving suites, 2 pairs of goggles, diving knife, 2 non-slip shoes, a mobile GPS, medical supplies, food, magazines and Chan’s personal mobile telephone on board the Uniana on the morning of 15 August 1998. Chan handed the pieces of paper given to him by Nam containing the radio frequencies and shipping co-ordinates to Ah Mong the Indonesian/Mandarin interpreter on board who handed such papers to the appellant (Mandagi). He later returned the pieces of paper. Chan and Ah Lung returned to Aberdeen, Hong Kong and had lunch. Nam instructed them to rejoin the Uniana and they did so. It sailed about 5.00 pm.99   During the first 14 days of the trip Nam telephoned the Uniana everyday and enquired about its position. Either Ah Lung or Chan took these telephone calls. In the instances that Chan spoke to Nam, Chan was able to tell him of the boat’s current position after studying the GPS and sometimes after consulting the appellant. Chan said that he received a telephone call from Nam that they would soon be meeting the other boat and to get ready to set down the speedboat. Chan said that he relayed this information to Ah Lung and told him to tell the appellant to make ready with the speedboat. The appellant became angry and threatened to leave if nothing happened that night. Chan said that he would let the boss (Nam) know. A short time later contact was made between the appellant, Ah Lung and a further vessel by way of a two-way radio. Thereafter the transfer of the heroin and Man Chai from that further vessel to the Uniana using the speedboat occurred. Not long after that was completed Nam checked with Chan via the satellite telephone that the “parcels” were on board. Chan was told: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ""...Take the black bags and the plastic bags out of your cabin and take them to Man Chai. Go and help Man Chai he knows what to do with them.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     Chan did as Nam instructed. The heroin was removed from the speedboat, the blocks of heroin being put in sealed plastic bags and packed in black carry bags.  
     100  At the trial of the appellant the evidence in chief of Chan broadly followed the terms of his statement of 19 March 1999 but much more detail was led. In the cross-examination Chan stated that when he saw the rice bags being thrown into the speedboat he knew for the first time that he was involved in prohibited drugs. He said that at his point he knew that he had been tricked. He was unable to discuss the position with Man Chai, the appellant or the crew because had did not know where they stood. Chan was cross-examined about his statement of 10 December 1999 in which he stated that during the first conversation with Nam he had said “One person for so many belongings.” Chan said that the original version should be “one person with belongings.” Chan said that when he enquired as to what the personal belonging of the escapee were, Nam replied “Of course valuable things. This person is escaping. Do you think he would bring rubbish along.” (T113). Chan said that once the rice sacks were brought on board he looked for any chance to escape but there was no chance. He continued on with the enterprise because of fear of reprisals to himself and his family if he tried to withdraw.101 After some cross-examination of Chan to the effect that he went on board the Uniana on 14 August 1998 and that his statement that he was in China on that day was incorrect, Chan appealed to the judge and sought an assurance that whatever he said in court would not subject him to being charged. This led to considerable discussion between the judge and counsel and the adjournment of the hearing for over a day and thereafter the interposition of other evidence. Three days after Chan had appealed to the judge he returned to the witness box. In the meantime he had given another statement to the police. The Crown led further evidence in chief.102 Chan gave evidence of events he had previously withheld. Chan stated that he first met the captain and crew, except for the Chief Engineer, on 15 July 1998 on the On Shun. He went on board on that occasion with Nam and another worker. Nam spoke with the appellant. Chan said that he went out to the On Shun on two further occasions but did not board it, namely, once to deliver some cigarettes to the crew and secondly to take some food to the crew.  
     103 Chan said that on 10 and 11 August 1998 he boarded the Uniana with a technician who repaired the derrick with his assistance. Nam told him (Chan) on the morning of 14 August 1998 that the Uniana was gong to be used for the enterprise and house the speedboat.104 Chan said that on 14 August 1998 Nam, a man called Dai Gie and he went out to the On Shun. Nam spoke with the appellant and explained that the crew members of the other ship (Uniana) had a dispute over wages and expressed the hope that the crew on the On Shun would transfer to the other ship. The appellant consulted with the crew. According to Chan, the appellant replied that there would be no problem in transferring to the other ship except for the Chief Engineer and a couple of other persons. However, all wages to date had to be paid. Nam paid them their wages. Chan said that while the appellant promised to be the captain of the proposed trip, he (Chan) did not know how much the appellant knew.105  After Nam and the appellant spoke further it was said that they had to change ship in the afternoon and that all crew members should pack their things. The appellant gave some instructions to the second officer who selected some maps and rolled them up. The crew from the Uniana transferred to the On Shun. The appellant and the crew from the On Shun then transferred to the Uniana. Chan said that he, Nam and Dai Gie transferred to the Uniana. 
     106 In further cross-examination Chan agreed that in his evidence on his sentencing hearing he had said that he had told the police one hundred per cent truth. He also agreed that he had said he had told the police everything he knew. Chan said that he was hesitant about disclosing what was in his last statement because he was worried about the crew facing a very harsh future. 
     107 Chan claimed not to be sure that the area in which he slept was the captain’s quarters in the Uniana. He agreed that there was a satellite telephone adjacent to his bunk. 
     108 A review of the material demonstrates that Chan was one of Nam’s lieutenants and that he was responsible for many of the preparatory steps of the intended voyage. He was also responsible for ensuring that the “belongings” of the escapee were safely transferred at sea at night by torchlight from the vessel that met them in the Andaman Sea to the speedboat and thence to the Uniana. Chan’s reconnaissance decisions in Australia coupled with his other roles prior to and after 15 August 1998 lead to the conclusion that his measure of responsibility and culpability was at least equal to that of the appellant. When the judge sentenced Chan, the judge was not aware of all the facts and sentenced him on the basis of him having less responsibility than he actually had. This was in part due to the appellant not disclosing some facts to the judge. It happens not infrequently that, because there is no one to test adequately the story of a co-accused on a plea of guilty, all the relevant facts do not emerge and the person being sentenced receives a lighter sentence than he should. This creates problems when other offenders are being sentenced and a fuller factual picture emerges. 
     109 The appellant submitted that he was less culpable objectively than Chan for these reasons. Unlike the appellant, Chan was in direct and regular contact with those higher in the organisation both prior to and for the duration of the voyage. He was, even on his own account, benefiting financially far more than the appellant. Chan had received $HK100,000 and was to receive another SHK200,000 making a total of $HK300,000. There was evidence that the appellant had received $HK50,000. There was also his monthly salary of about $HK12,000 per month for some six months plus one month’s extra salary. Chan was going to make about three times the remuneration of the appellant. The difference in financial reward is eloquent of Chan’s standing and importance to Nam’s drug trafficking activities. Chan was involved in handling the heroin on board Uniana whereas the appellant was not involved and was excluded. The appellant also relied on the other aspects of Chan’s role including the recruitment of Ah Lung. 
     110 The appellant pointed out that the judge did not find that the appellant was more deeply involved in the enterprise than Chan. Such a finding would have been untenable. The appellant submitted that if the offence of which he was convicted was fairly able to be described as “worst category case” then Chan’s offence was even more firmly entrenched within that category and he should not have received a s.16G adjustment. The appellant stressed the difference between factors mitigating the seriousness of the crime and those mitigating the seriousness of the penalty. 
     111 The crime committed by the appellant was a very grave one as was that committed by Chan. Both were involved over a lengthy period in the intended importation. Both the appellant and Chan had a propensity to lie and this makes sentencing more difficult. Both tried to play down their roles. Their roles were different but Chan’s criminality and the appellant’s criminality were about equal. Both were in difficult financial circumstances and both needed work. The financial rewards for Chan were to be much greater than those of the appellant. Even allowing for Chan’s plea of guilty and his assistance to the authorities the disparity between the sentences imposed upon Chan and the appellant is marked and gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the appellant’s part. I have had regard to all the matters required under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). I have regard to the judge’s starting point and mitigation calculations when sentencing Chan. After the s.16G adjustment and absent the mitigation of sentence for plea and assistance the judge would have imposed a sentence of 26 years with a non-parole period of 20 years on Chan. To achieve a reasonable parity with Chan’s sentence and taking into account the high objective gravity of the appellant’s offence the starting point for the appellant would be a sentence of 40 years. I regard this as the lowest permissible starting point. An adjustment under s.16G of just under one-third should be made, namely, 13 years. This reduces the sentence to 27 years. A lesser sentence would be incorrect. There should be a non-parole period of 19 years. This is not within the usual range of 60 to 66.66 per cent suggested in Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44, but a little above it. However, in view of the circumstances of this case a lesser non-parole period would not sufficiently reflect the appellant’s criminality and the consequent minimum period which he must serve before being eligible for parole. 
     112 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
         1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         3. Appeal against sentence allowed. Sentence quashed. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         4. In lieu of the sentence imposed, the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 27 years commencing on 14 October 1998 with a non-parole period of 19 years commencing that day and ending on 13 October 2017.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 DUNFORD J: This is an application by Ahmed Raad for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him by his Honour Judge Goldring in the District Court at Wollongong on 24 October 2001 following his pleas of guilty to a number of offences. 
      
       
     2 The first matter was a charge of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s 91(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 committed on 1 February 2001 at Mortdale when the applicant and a co-offender produced a knife and threatened to stab a person who was seated in the driver's seat of his car and took $55 and the victim's backpack. The applicant was arrested on 27 February, admitted the offence, was charged and admitted to bail. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence. In respect of this offence the sentence of 2 years imprisonment with no non-parole period was the same as that given to his co-offender except that the co-offender's sentence was suspended, a course which was not open to his Honour in respect of the applicant because of the other matters. 
      
       
     3 On 3 June 2001 whilst on bail for this offence, the applicant approached Liam McGarr at the Downtown Backpack Hotel at 701 George Street, Haymarket, and in the foyer of that establishment, being in possession of a replica rifle and a knife, demanded the resident's money and threatened to shoot and/or stab him. The victim said he did not have any money so the applicant rifled through the resident's bag and stole a pair of sunglasses and a small mini torch. He also indicated during the attack that he had an AK47 Assault Rifle in his bag. He then left the premises and went to the vicinity of Paddy's Market.  
      
       
     4 Later that morning he approached two young men, Nathan Townsend, aged 18, and Michael Hopkins, aged 17, in George Street. He told them that he was a police officer and commenced to look in their bags, at the same time pulling his jacket aside so that both victims saw what appeared to be a silver coloured pistol tucked into the front of the applicant's trousers. They tried to walk away from him but he followed, telling them that he wanted both their bags, wallets and everything, or he would shoot them. He also told them he had just got out of gaol, apparently departing from the policeman story, and that he had nothing to lose, at the same time having his hand under his jacket in the vicinity where the victims had sighted the silver pistol.  
      
       
     5 Both victims, although scared and in fear of their safety, refused to hand over anything and walked up George Street to Town Hall Police Station where they reported the matter. A short time later the applicant was arrested by police in the foyer of Hoyts Cinema complex. He was found to have a silver coloured replica pistol and a gold coloured knife in a curved sabre and small amounts of cannabis and heroin on him. He declined to be interviewed or to take part in an identification parade. He was arrested, charged and bail refused. 
      
       
     6 Arising out of the events of that morning, having earlier indicated an intention to plead guilty, he was subsequently arraigned on two counts: (1) the robbery of Liam McGarr whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, and (2) the assault on Michael Hopkins whilst armed with a dangerous weapon with intent to rob, both offences being contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act. Five other matters were taken into account on a Form 1 namely, (1) the assault of Nathan Townsend whilst armed with a dangerous weapon with intent to rob, (2) without reasonable excuse have in his custody in a public place a knife, (3) possess prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, (4) possess prohibited drug, namely heroin and (5) impersonate a police officer. 
      
       
     7 The offences of 3 June therefore related to three incidents; the first count, the robbery in the Downtown Backpack Hotel, the second count, and the matters numbered (1), (2) and (5) on the Form 1, related to the incident in George Street, and finally, the matters numbered (3) and (4) on the Form 1, the drug possession matters, which are not particularly important in the overall picture. 
      
       
     8 In respect of the two matters in the indictment and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the applicant was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years. The sentences to be concurrent with each other and concurrent also with the fixed term of 2 years imposed for the February offence at Mortdale. The sentences were backdated to 27 May 2001 apparently to allow for a short period of custody in respect of the February offence before the applicant was admitted to bail. 
      
       
     9 In sentencing the applicant, the learned Sentencing Judge took into account a number of matters which he referred to in his Remarks on Sentence including that the offences in June were committed whilst on bail for the February matter and that this made them more serious, that in view of the time lapse the February matters and the matters of 3 June could not be regarded as a single instance of criminality, and that all the victims stated that they were frightened or terrified. His Honour further took into account the character references which had been tendered showing the applicant to be a person of good character prior to these matters, and the report of Doctor Richard Teo, which described him as suffering from an anxiety problem, moderate anxiety, but no other psychological problems. He also took into account the Probation and Parole Report and submissions made that at the time of these offences the applicant was subject to some family differences between his parents and that he had been unsettled by these differences, but that he was a relatively young man and there were good prospects of rehabilitation, his contrition and his plea of guilty. 
      
       
     10 His Honour then said that he took as a starting point a sentence of 8 years imprisonment but allowed a discount of 25 percent on account of the early plea of guilty thus reducing it to a term of 6 years and because of the prospect of rehabilitation he set a non-parole period of 4 years. In doing so, his Honour plainly found special circumstances because otherwise s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 would have required a non-parole period of not less than 4½ years. His Honour then made all the sentences concurrent. 
      
       
     11 In R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 this Court laid out a number of guidelines for sentencing in cases of armed robbery and in the circumstances referred to indicated generally a head sentence of between 4 and 5 years. As the Court here was imposing sentences to be concurrent, it was in fact sentencing for three armed robberies and taking additional matters into account which justified a starting point somewhat in excess of 5 years. Admittedly, the attempts by the applicant were quite amateur in nature, the value of the items taken were minimal and there were not a number of common aggravating features such as vulnerable people (e.g. shop keepers at night or taxi drivers). The pistol in fact was harmless, although that fact was not known to the unfortunate victims who were terrorized by it. 
      
       
     12 In addition, there were a number of subjective factors applicable. The applicant was comparatively young, being 18 at the time, his only previous convictions were on 1 June 2001 at Sutherland Local Court for being carried in a conveyance without consent and goods in custody. He had been arrested on 20 February 2001, after the commission of the Mortdale offence, but before he had been arrested for that offence. It is unfortunate that having been fined for these matters on Friday 1 June, he went and committed the other serious offences two days later on the Sunday morning, 3 June. Prior to this mini crime spree the applicant had a clean record and had never been to gaol previously. He had attained his School Certificate and done a TAFE course as a hairdresser and was working as an apprentice hairdresser for his father. I have already referred to the character references. 
      
       
     13 The evidence establishes, and the Sentencing Judge found that there were a number of differences between his parents which had led to problems within the family and he had ceased working for his father and suffered a degree of anxiety. His prospects of rehabilitation appear good. In all the circumstances I consider that a starting point of 8 years was within the range of an appropriate sentencing discretion and that 25 percent discount for a plea of guilty was appropriate. 
      
       
     14 As I have said, his Honour reduced the non-parole period from 4½ to 4 years, but bearing in mind the youth of the applicant, his generally prior good record, the strong character references, the fact this is his first time in gaol and his prospect of rehabilitation, it seems to me that a greater allowance should have been made in adjusting the non-parole period. Notwithstanding the arguments about parity, I consider the sentence on the Mortdale matter was appropriate, particularly as it was made concurrent with the other sentences.  
      
       
     15 I would, therefore, grant an extension of time and I would grant leave to appeal. In respect of the matter on the s 51A document I would dismiss the appeal. In respect of the matters in the indictment I would uphold the appeal. I would confirm the head sentence of 6 years on each of the matters, to be served concurrently, but I would quash the non-parole period and in lieu thereof fix a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 27 May 2001 and expiring on 26 May 2004. 
      
       
     16 CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     17 DUNFORD J: The order of the Court will therefore be as I have indicated.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court of New South Wales for various offences of armed robbery. There were 10 counts of armed robbery on indictment, and on a Form 1 document there were contained 10 further counts for offences of armed robbery and for three offences of attempted armed robbery. The applicant had pleaded guilty to each count on the indictment and sought that those on the Form 1 document be taken into account on sentence. 
      
       
     2 The sentences that were imposed on counts one to nine in the indictment comprised sentences of five years imprisonment, in each case to be served by way of fixed terms, each to commence on 29 October 1999 and to expire on 28 October 2004. On count 10 a sentence of imprisonment for five years was imposed, to commence on 29 October 2004. That sentence thus was cumulated on the sentences imposed on counts one to nine and on this sentence the trial judge took into account the matters on the Form 1. His Honour imposed a non-parole period of 12 months to commence on 29 October 2004 and to expire on 28 October 2005. There was thus, effectively, an overall sentence of 10 years, with a six year non-parole period. 
      
       
     3 The offences were committed in association with a co-accused, one Nigel Thomas Antecki. The charges of which Antecki was convicted following his plea, were referred to by the learned sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence when he said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The co-offender, Nigel Antecki, pleaded guilty to eight armed robberies and 12 attempted armed robberies in the Local Court. I sentenced him on 17 August taking into account 14 offences being 13 armed robberies and one attempted armed robbery."" 
         
        
       
     4 When the learned trial judge came to sentence the present applicant he expressed the view that he saw no basis for distinguishing between the criminality of the two offenders. There were some matters of distinction. The present applicant did not carry the knife, which was used in the offences, on 21 of the 24 occasions. He did, however, participate in a large number of offences with his co-offender with the knowledge that the co-offender had the knife and he assisted with the commission of those offences by terrorizing the victims. Unlike his co-offender, he had prior good character. The co-offender had prior convictions that included robbery in company, supplying drugs and arson. The co-offender, however, had had a more traumatic childhood than the present applicant and was a little over a year younger. 
      
       
     5 In the upshot, the learned sentencing judge had imposed an overall sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of seven years on the co-offender. He therefore allowed a discount for these differences to the present applicant of one year on the head sentence and on the non-parole period. 
      
       
     6 The learned sentencing judge also proceeded on the basis that there was no real basis for distinguishing between the criminality involved in each offence committed by the applicant. He adequately and properly applied the principle enunciated in Regina v. Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 that the sentence for each offence must reflect the criminality of that matter, and had regard to the principle of totality in the way in which the sentences were structured. 
      
       
     7 His Honour found special circumstances including the applicant's age; that this was the applicant's first custodial sentence; and the fact that the sentences were to be accumulated. 
      
       
     8 However, his Honour found there were in common with those found in the Antecki matter circumstances which were highly remarkable. Despite this enormous spate of violent criminality in which the two offenders had participated, they had not man-handled the victims; they had not committed any physical injury upon the victims; and each having been drug addicts at the time of the commission of the offences, had sought to turn from drugs and from criminality. The judge in the case of this applicant made the following finding:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""After the offender went into custody he went 'cold turkey' and has resisted the temptation to become involved in drugs in prison. This must have been a very traumatic experience for him especially as it was his first time in custody. It is clear that the offender has made plans for his future that do not involve drugs. He is undertaking courses in gaol and plans to do more. In addition he has undergone drug and rehabilitation counselling"".  
         
        
       
     9 Antecki too had sought to avoid drugs in prison and started to address his addiction. 
      
       
     10 It is not necessary to review further the circumstances of the commission of the offences and the appropriateness of the sentences passed, since a well founded submission is made that this appeal should be upheld in the light of an earlier judgment of this court. The co-accused Antecki had sought leave to appeal which was on 10 August 2001 granted. The appeal was upheld and the sentence reduced upon the basis that the trial judge's sentence was manifestly excessive. It is submitted that in justice this appeal should be similarly treated. This would necessitate the following orders: firstly, that the applicant should have his appeal reinstated notwithstanding a notice of abandonment filed. Secondly, that the applicant should have an extension of time on his application for leave to appeal. Thirdly, that he should have leave to appeal against sentence, and fourthly, the sentences below be quashed and more lenient sentenced imposed in lieu. 
      
       
     11 Having regard to the material in the affidavits provided by the applicant which was read to the court without objection - the first being the affidavit of 20 September 2001, the second being that of 14 March 2002 - the Crown has accepted that in the event that the court were minded to intervene on a parity basis, having regard to the course this court took in relation to the co-accused, it would be proper to permit the appeal to proceed notwithstanding the abandonment and to grant the extension of time and leave to appeal. On that concession, I am of the view that it would be proper to grant the relief sought as I accept the submission the appeal should on that ground, succeed. 
      
       
     12 It having become apparent that the trial judge had properly sentenced the applicant and Antecki on the basis of a relativity between the two, having regard to their common culpability and to the matters of distinction to which I have referred, I consider the appeal should succeed and the relativity should be preserved. The applicant would undoubtedly have a reasonably based and justifiable sense of grievance, in my view, if in those circumstances this court having upheld the co-offender's appeal on the basis that the sentence was manifestly excessive, stayed its hand in respect of his application for leave to appeal. I do not understand the Crown to be submitting to the contrary because the Crown properly has recognised the effect of the previous judgment of this court. 
      
       
     13 Therefore, I conclude that the appeal should be upheld and that the sentence passed in the District Court should be quashed and that the applicant should be re-sentenced to sentences totalling eight years, nine months with a four years, nine months non-parole period. It is conceded by the Crown that this sentence would preserve the relativity necessary. 
      
       
     14 At this point, the court will seek the assistance of counsel as to the appropriate way the sentences should be structured so as to achieve that overall sentence, which both counsel from the bar table have submitted is appropriate so as to continue to reflect the relative positions of the applicant and his co-offender. 
      
       
        
       UPON RESUMPTION 
        
       
     15 I had reached the point in my judgment where the matter was stood down in the list to permit counsel to afford assistance to the court as to the appropriate way in which the sentences should be structured so as to represent adequately the appropriate degree of relativity between the applicant and his co-offender and as would appropriately reflect the various circumstances of each in the light of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Antecki, to which I have referred. 
      
       
     16 It has now been submitted by both counsel to us that, having regard to the finding of special circumstances, which finding we would reiterate here for the same reasons given by the trial judge, the appropriate course to take is that the sentences imposed in the District Court be quashed and the applicant, in lieu, be sentenced on each of counts one to nine, to sentences of four years imprisonment each by way of fixed term, those sentences being concurrent and to date from 29 October 1999 to expire on 28 October 2003. On count 10, being the count on which the matters in the Form 1 are to be taken into account, the applicant should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment cumulatively on the sentences imposed on counts one to nine, of four years and nine months to commence on 29 October 2003 with a non-parole period of nine months to commence from that date, 29 October 2003, whereby the applicant would become eligible for release on parole on 28 July 2004. Having regard to s.53 and s.45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, no non-parole period will be fixed for the fixed term sentences on counts one to nine because of the penalty imposed on count 10 and having regard to the fact that the sentence on count 20 is cumulative upon the fixed term sentences imposed on counts one to nine. 
      
       
     17 The orders I propose, therefore, are as following: set aside the Notice of Abandonment; grant extension of time to appeal; grant leave to appeal; uphold the appeal; set aside the sentences below and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to the sentences I have set out.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales at Parramatta for two offences of obtaining financial advantage by deception. These are offences created by s.178BA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, each of which is punishable by a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. To each of these offences the applicant pleaded guilty before the Magistrate and adhered to his pleas before the learned sentencing District Court judge. 
      
       
     2 At the time the applicant was 65 years of age having been born on the 23 January 1937. 
      
       
     3 The applicant was sentenced on the first count to a fixed term of imprisonment for three years to date from the 16 March 2001, that sentence expiring on the 15 March 2004; on the second count the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three years and nine months to commence on the 16 March 2004 and to expire on the 15 December 2007. The learned trial judge imposed in respect of that latter sentence a non-parole period of one year to commence on 16 March 2004 and to expire on the 15 March 2005. The applicant had been on bail prior to his conviction on the 16 March 2001 when he was remanded in custody. The sentences therefore dated from the date the applicant first went into custody. 
      
       
     4 A number of grounds have been advanced in criticism of the sentences. For an understanding of those grounds some summary is necessary of the facts on which the applicant came forward for sentence. Each of the counts charged offences over a period, the first between the 5 May 1993 and the 8 October 1999 and the second the 2 February 1994 to the 29 October 1999. It can be seen that the periods overlapped. The first count was said to involve the obtaining of some $232,433.10, the second, further amounts totalling $213,200; thus the total amount taken by the offender over the total period was some $445,603.10. This amount was taken in what the trial judge referred to as a sustained course of criminality over a period of six and a half years involving the forging of cheques or the creation of false instruments involving some 878 separate cheques. 
      
       
     5 The applicant was of the age of 56 when he commenced this course of fraud and he continued it to the age of 62. He had had no prior convictions. He was a clerk employed by a firm of accountants for the purpose of maintaining and operating a trust fund established by a deceased husband and wife for the benefit of their children. That fund managed various business enterprises. The manager of the fund attended at the accountant's office to draw cheques on a fortnightly basis and the applicant from his position of trust took advantage of that circumstance to obtain cheques in his favour by manipulating the circumstances in which the cheques came to be signed. He either forged the signature of one or other of the signatories or both signatories and effected thereby fraudulent drawings from the accounts of the companies operated by the trust. 
      
       
     6 The applicant in those circumstances breached the trust placed in him not only by his employer, so found the trial judge, but also by the beneficiaries of the estate with whom he had been in regular contact. He had apparently fallen into these criminal ways by reason of his having developed what her Honour referred to as a ""syndrome"", that is to say, he had become a gambling addict. In particular he had spent this enormous sum of money on poker machines, horse racing and keno. 
      
       
     7 The trial judge made a positive finding that he would have had some winnings during this period but it appeared to her that those winnings too had been dissipated along with the money taken from the trust. She found that the applicant is dependent upon his wife who provided a statement and gave evidence in his favour. 
      
       
     8 The applicant's contention that his employers were at fault by failing properly to audit the accounts can be disregarded. There is nothing mitigatory in such a belief. In particular it only goes to emphasise the advantage he took of his position of trust. This, of course, was found by her Honour. He had had, she found, an unremarkable and relatively stable early life, although his first marriage had failed and he had married his present partner shortly prior to being detected for these offences. There are no children of that relationship. 
      
       
     9 At his age it has become apparent that there will be no reasonable likelihood of his being employed again when he is released from custody. He has no assets, there is no prospect of restitution and it is most unlikely that he would have any further opportunity in his lifetime to acquire assets to make restitution. 
      
       
     10 The trial judge found (and it is supported by the evidence) that he has always both drunk and gambled to excess, that his inability to fund his gambling from his own resources was the initial cause of the pattern of dishonesty that had brought him before the court. 
      
       
     11 He left his employment due to his high anxiety levels generated by his own dishonesty. For some months he was able to hold at bay those who were seeking from him audited accounts and even during that time he did not refrain from continuing his frauds. However, when spoken to by the police, he made full admissions. 
      
       
     12 There was some delay in the matter going forward occasioned by the necessity for proper investigation but that delay was occasioned by the nature of the accounting exercise involved rather than by any dilatoriness on his part or on the part of the prosecuting authorities. 
      
       
     13 The trial judge found (and it was the evidence from his referees and the opinion of his Probation and Parole Service officer) that he was genuinely ashamed and remorseful for his conduct, that there was no realistic likelihood of his offending in the future and that in effect there was no necessity to make particular provision for personal deterrence in the sentence since the experience of his being charged and in prison would act as an effective personal deterrent. 
      
       
     14 The learned trial judge, however, turned to general deterrence and in that connection found that it was necessary for there to be condign sentences for those who might be minded to abuse the trust imposed in them in like circumstances to the offender. It was an offence for which she properly held that there was no alternative to full-time imprisonment (notwithstanding that it will be the offender's first time in custody), that imprisonment would be most unpleasant for him and at his age such imprisonment would be especially onerous. 
      
       
     15 He suffers from neurodermatitis and high blood pressure which itself did not render the sentence much more onerous but which, taken in conjunction with his age, no doubt minded her Honour to remark:- 
      
       
        
         
         “It will no doubt be a most unpleasant experience having regard to his age and background"". 
         
        
       
     16 He has attempted with some degree of success, the trial judge found, to turn away from gambling addiction and is apparently, according to the evidence of his wife, (which her Honour seemed to have accepted) able to drink and gamble in moderation. Her Honour concluded, and in my view rightly, that it is an appropriate matter in which to provide for a lengthy period on parole having regard to the necessity for the protection of the community, so that when the offender returns to the community he will not again be attracted to gambling and thus risk further criminality. 
      
       
     17 Her Honour was of the view therefore that there should be a variation of the normal sentence to parole period relatively pursuant to s.44(2). By that I understand that her Honour found all of those matters to be special circumstances such as would warrant a disturbance of the statutory ratio. Her Honour proceeded on the basis favourable to the offender that he was suffering from the syndrome to which I have referred. She had regard to various decisions and various authorities concerning individual sentences in like circumstances. She concluded:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Having regard to the period of time over which these offences were committed, the persistent criminality and the amount involved, the offender will be sentenced to a head sentence in each case to the full amount allowed by law namely five years"". 
         
        
       
      18 However, her Honour expressed the view that there should be a reduction of 25% reflecting the discount to which she had earlier referred of the head sentence in each case as:- 
      
       
        
         
          
         “Appropriate as acknowledgement of the utilitarian aspect of the saving of considerable court time and time for witnesses."" 
         
        
       
     19 That discount reflected the principles in The Queen v. Thomson & Houlton (2000) 115 A. Crim. R. 104, the decision in the present case having come down prior to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Cameron v. The Queen [2002] HCA 6. Her Honour continued, that by applying that 25% discount, the head sentence would be reduced to ""three years and nine months"". Plainly that is a reference to 75% of the statutory maximum in each case. She continued:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Applying the principles of totality the sentences will be accumulated, and there will therefore be a fixed sentence imposed in the first count, with an accumulated sentence on the second count, providing a non-parole and parole period"". 
         
        
       
     20 Thus it was that context that her Honour passed the sentences to which I have referred. It can be seen that the fixed term of imprisonment of three years her Honour imposed was nine months less than the figure she had nominated, apparently in order to accommodate the principle of totality to which she had referred. It would seem to me that what her Honour has done is to sentence the offender on each count to the maximum sentence allowed by law, to provide the totality discount of nine months (to which I have referred) on the first sentence only, to provide on each sentence the 25% discount appropriate for early plea or for willingness to facilitate the course of justice (see Cameron (supra)) and to provide that the sentences be cumulative. 
      
       
     21 Despite her Honour having found a number of matters favourable subjectively to the applicant and despite her Honour having had regard to them, those matters do not seem to have figured in the final sentences. Indeed, there seems to be no allowance for his age, his health, the existence of the syndrome, remorse, the lack of necessity for further personal deterrence, his prior lack of record, that it was his first time in custody and the onerous effect of the sentence on him at his age. 
      
       
     22 True it is that matters subjective to the offender and personal to his circumstances are subsidiary to the necessity that the sentences reflect adequately the objective culpability of the offender, but that is not to say that such matters shall be omitted from figuring in the end result. 
      
       
     23 Although there were only two charges, and it appears that the criminality overall of the offender was disclosed in the statement of facts upon which her Honour was asked to sentence, it does not appear that her Honour appropriately treated the two charges as though they were representative or specimen charges. No resort was had to the expedient of placing other offences upon a Form 1. 
      
       
     24 It seemed to be common ground that her Honour was to treat the two charges as though they were substantive charges but as reflecting the whole of the offender's criminality; it is only on that basis that it is explicable that her Honour sentenced the offender in the way in which she did to the maximum sentence according to law, less the discount to which I have referred on each charge. But notwithstanding that, it was, in my view, an error on her part to sentence in such a way as failed entirely to reflect the other matters that she had found in favour of the offender and thus to produce the sentences that she passed. 
      
       
     25 I would conclude therefore that her Honour in that respect fell into error and that some other sentence is both warranted in law and should have been passed. In those circumstances s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is applicable and it falls to this court to re-sentence. For that purpose submissions were entertained from counsel as to the appropriate way in which such a sentence might be structured as would adequately reflect the matters found by her Honour and the additional considerations to which I have referred. 
      
       
     26 During those submissions an incongruity came to light. It was submitted that it was not possible to structure a sentence that would produce an effective overall result on the two counts of a term of imprisonment in total of six years with a non-parole period of three years having regard to the principles referred to by the High Court of Australia in The Queen v. Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610. In that decision the High Court of Australia made it clear that it is necessary for sentencing courts to pass a sentence which in the case of multiple offences adequately reflects the criminality and affords individual weight to each crime. The incongruity to which I have referred is that should one apply Pearce (supra) to the head sentences or to the head sentences having regard to the provisions of the New South Wales Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and in particular s.44 and s.45 of that Act, it is necessary to provide for a non-parole period for both sentences and in that regard, if one is to preserve some relationship between the non-parole periods, one almost invariably produces a gap period. Consequently the course that has to be taken, if sufficient weight is given to the culpability of each of the crimes in each of the head sentences, is to structure a non-parole period which seems to have little relationship to the head sentence to which it is applied. Nonetheless, if this is the course that has to be taken in order to produce an overall sentence which adequately reflects the justice of the case that is the course to which we are relegated. Counsels' submissions, as I understand them, were to that effect. 
      
       
     27 The orders that I would propose therefore are that leave to appeal be granted, the appeal upheld, the sentences imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu the applicant sentenced on count 1 to a fixed term of two years six months imprisonment to date from the 16 March 2001 and to expire on the 15 September 2003; on count 2 the applicant to be sentenced to a period of imprisonment of three years six months to commence on the 16 September 2003 and to expire on the 15 March 2007. On that sentence there will be a non-parole period of six months to expire on the 15 March 2004. On the first sentence I would decline to impose a non-parole period for the reason that the sentence on a fixed term and the sentence on the second count is to be cumulative on the sentence on the first count. It having been noted that counsel is content with the formulation in that form I propose the orders that I have said. 
      
       
     28 BUDDIN J: I agree. 
      
       
     29 GREG JAMES J: The orders therefore will be as I have proposed.***************

       At the trial neither the appellant nor the co-accused gave evidence. The trial judge gave a direction that: 
        
        
         
         “The relevance of the fact that the accused has not given evidence can only go to the value, or the weight, which you can give to the evidence which the Crown witnesses have given”. 
         
        
        
       This direction was wrong in law and this was conceded by the Crown:  
       RPS v R 
        (2000) 199 CLR 620;  
       Azzopardi v R 
        (2001) 75 ALJR 931. The appellant submitted that his conviction should therefore be quashed. The Crown argued that the proviso under s 6(1) of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 
        1912 (NSW) that ‘no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred’ should be applied. 
        
        
       HELD per Beazley JA (Hulme and Barr JJ agreeing) 
        
       (i) The misdirection was not so fundamental such that  
       “the proceedings have so far miscarried as barely to be a trial at all”

        (1994) 68 ALJR 209;

       Per Beazley JA (Barr J agreeing) 
        
       (ii) The conviction of the appellant was inevitable: 
        
        
         
         (a) The defences of provocation and self-defence could not have been made out on the evidence. 
          
          
         (b) Given the severe kicking and stomping on the head of the deceased, the appellant, who was the main person involved, intended to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased. 
          
          
         (c) Although there were some differences in the observations of the Crown witnesses, the consistency of their evidence as to the appellant’s participation in the attack and the nature of the attack was overwhelming. 
         
        
        
       HELD per Hulme J  
        
       (i) The defences of provocation and self-defence could not have been made out on the evidence (agreeing with Beazley JA and Barr J on this point). 
        
        
       (ii) Apart from the circumstances of the fight, there was no evidence that the appellant intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
        
        
       (iii) Even given the circumstances of the fight, grievous bodily harm was not an inevitable result of the kicking to and stomping on the deceased’s head. 
        
        
       (iv) Accordingly, the conviction was not inevitable.

      REGINA v Ivesh KARKI 
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 BEAZLEY JA: On 5 September 1999 the appellant and one Nitin Giri were convicted of the murder of Sajedul Haque. Each was sentenced to a minimum term of 12 years to date from 15 September 1999 and an additional term of 5 years to commence on 15 September 2011. 
      
       
     2 The appellant appeals against his conviction on the ground that the trial judge erred in his directions to the jury concerning the use they could make of the fact the appellant did not give evidence. An application to appeal against sentence was not pursued. 
      
       
     3 The direction of which the appellant complains was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “However, you may when judging the value, or the weight of the evidence which has been put forward by the Crown, in seeking to prove its case against the accused, take into account the election by the accused, not to deny or contradict matters in the evidence at this trial, about which the accused could have given direct evidence. You cannot use the election of the accused not to put forward any denial or contradiction so as to fill in gaps which you might otherwise see in the evidence upon which the Crown relies.  
         The relevance of the fact that the accused has not given evidence can only go to the value, or the weight, which you can give to the evidence which the Crown witnesses have given 
         .”  
         (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     4 That direction was wrong in law: see RPS v R (2000) 199 CLR 620; Azzopardi v R (2001) 75 ALJR 931 and this Court so held on the appeal of the co-accused Giri: R v Giri [2001] NSWCCA 197. The Crown acknowledged that his Honour’s direction was erroneous. 
      
       
     5 The appellant submits that the conviction should be quashed. The Crown argues, however, that despite the error, this is an appropriate case in which to apply the proviso under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), so that the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.  
      
       
     6 The proviso under s 6(1) will not be applied, namely where the convicted person has “lost a real chance of acquittal”: R v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364 at 376. In Wilde v R (1988) 164 CLR 365 Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ, after referring to the authorities summarised the principle in these terms at 372: 
      
       
        
         
         “Unless it can be said, the accused may have lost a fair chance of acquittal by the failure to afford him the trial to which he was entitled, that is to say, a trial in which the relevant law was correctly explained to the jury and the rules of procedure and evidence were strictly followed: see Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514. The loss of such a chance of acquittal cannot be anything but a substantial miscarriage of justice. The question whether the jury would inevitably have convicted falls to be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. It is a question which the Court of Criminal Appeal must answer according to its assessment of the facts of the case.” 
         
        
       
     7 However, the question whether a reasonable jury would inevitably have convicted does not arise where the error is so fundamental such that “the proceedings have so far miscarried as barely to be a trial at all”: Wilde at 372-373. See also R v Bozzola [2001] NSWCCA 8; Glennon v R (1994) 68 ALJR 209. 
      
       
     8 In the appeal of the co-accused Giri it was argued that the error was of such a nature. The Court rejected that argument. In his judgment at para 40, Heydon JA (Barr J and Smart AJ agreeing as to the principle) referred to the statement of Mason CJ, Brennan and Toohey JJ in Glennon at 710-712:  
      
       
        
         
         “In the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the trial judge’s misdirection on the applicant’s right to silence was ‘so fundamental’ that the trial was ‘hardly a trial at all’. Although the right to silence is a fundamental right of any accused person, it cannot be said that  
         any 
          misdirection on that subject is a fundamental irregularity of the kind discussed in Wilde. In this case, the trial judge directed the jury that they were not to use the applicant’s exercise of his right to silence in a manner adverse to him. This direction was perfectly proper. However, the trial judge then qualified the direction by informing the jury that they might use the applicant’s silence to test the veracity of the applicant’s defence. This subsequent direction was clearly erroneous. However, in the context in which it appeared and at a trial in which there was other evidence on which the applicant could be convicted and in which there was no other misdirection by the trial judge, the trial judge’s misdirection was not a fundamental irregularity. We would reject the applicant’s submissions in so far as they are based on this approach to the proviso.” 
         
        
       
     9 Their Honours also pointed out that in Wilde: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the majority stressed that there is no mechanical formula or rigid test to be applied to determine whether an irregularity is of this nature; each case will depend on its own circumstances and, in determining the question, it will be appropriate to have regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution and defence cases in order to assess the gravity and significance of the error.” 
         
        
       
     10 The considerations here are the same as were relevant in the case of the co-accused Giri. The principles in Glennon and Wilde to which I have referred and which were applied in Giri are directly applicable. Accordingly, the misdirection was not so fundamental as to require the conviction to be quashed. Counsel for the appellant did not strenuously argue otherwise.  
      
       
     11 That leaves the question therefore whether the conviction was inevitable in the sense used in Wilde.   
      
       
        
       Was the Conviction of this Appellant Inevitable? 
       
     12 The appellant submits that his conviction was not inevitable. He points to the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence given by the Crown witnesses, including inconsistencies in the version of events given by the various eye witnesses, as well as inconsistencies in the evidence of the witnesses themselves. In this regard, he draws on the comment by Heydon JA in Giri’s appeal at para 42: 
      
       
        
         
         “The events on the night in question seem to have blown up quite suddenly to the perception of some witnesses, and without any warning at all to the perception of others. The opportunities for clear observation were not ideal. The Crown witnesses offered a considerable disparity of observation and recollection, both when witness was compared with witness, and when particular parts of what one particular witness said was compared with other parts of what that particular witness said. The case against the appellant was far from being weak, but he could point to the fact that some parts of the evidence of some witnesses were favourable to him in the sense of being capable of creating a reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
     13 In addition, the appellant submits that even on the Crown case he had available to him the defences of provocation and self defence, the former which, if accepted by the jury, would have entitled him to an acquittal. It is convenient to deal with those two issues first. 
      
       
        
       Provocation 
       
     14 The appellant claimed that the deceased had made fun of his friend and then engaged in taunting and confronting conduct towards himself, such that he was provoked to a sufficient extent to amount to provocation in law. The defence of provocation is contained in s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That section provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this subsection and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused; and 
           
          
          
           
           (b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased,  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) For the purpose of determining whether an act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), there is no rule of law that provocation is negatived if: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) there was not a reasonable proportion between the act or omission causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act or omission;  
           
          
          
           
           (b) the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted suddenly; or 
           
          
          
           
           (c) the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted with any intent to take life or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (4) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, there is any evidence that the act causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted under provocation. 
         
        
        
         
         (5) This section does not exclude or limit any defence to a charge of murder.” 
         
        
       
     15 In Stingel v R (1990) 171 CLR 312, the High Court said at 324: 
      
       
        
         
         “The requirement that the wrongful act or insult be of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self control is clearly intended to involve an objective threshold test. It is only if that test is satisfied that it becomes necessary to consider whether the accused was, in fact, subjectively deprived of his or her self-control … As will be seen, however, that does not mean that the objective test was intended to be applied in a vacuum or without regard to such of the accused’s personal characteristics, attributes or history as serve to identify the implications and to affect the gravity of the particular wrongful act or insult.” 
         
        
       
     16 Their Honours noted at 325: 
      
       
        
         
         “Conduct which may in some circumstances be quite unprovocative may be intensely so in other circumstances. Particular acts or words which may, if viewed in isolation, be insignificant may be extremely provocative when viewed cumulatively.” 
         
        
       
     17 And further at 329: 
      
       
        
         
         “The assumption underlying the objective test in [the section] is not that to do an act which would otherwise be murder may be an ordinary or reasonable reaction to a wrongful act or insult. The assumption is that a wrongful act or insult may be of such a nature as to be sufficient to provoke an ordinary person to lose his or her self-control to an extent that he or she does the unreasonable and extraordinary, that is to say, an act which, were it not for the provocation, would constitute the crime of murder.” 
         
        
       
     18 The facts in Stingel were that the accused found his former girlfriend, with whom he was obsessed, engaged in sexual activities with the deceased in a car. The deceased told the accused to “piss off you cunt, piss off”. The accused then got a butcher’s knife from his car and stabbed the deceased to death. He claimed that seeing his former girlfriend engaging in sexual activities and he being abused, caused him to lose control. 
      
       
     19 The trial judge had refused to leave the defence to the jury. The High Court concluded at 336-337: 
      
       
        
         
         “… no jury, acting reasonably, could fail to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant’s reaction to the conduct of the deceased fell far below the minimum limits of the range of powers of self control which must be attributed to any hypothetical ordinary nineteen year old. 
         
        
        
         
         It follows that the learned trial judge was correct in declining to leave a defence of provocation … to the jury.” 
         
        
       
     20 In Masciantonio v R (1995) 183 CLR 58, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ stated at 66-67: 
      
       
        
         
         “The test involving the hypothetical ordinary person is an objective test which lays down the minimum standard of self-control required by the law. Since it is an objective test, the characteristics of the ordinary person are merely those of a person with ordinary powers of self-control. They are not the characteristics of the accused, although when it is appropriate to do so because of the accused’s immaturity, the ordinary person may be taken to be of the accused’s age. 
         
        
        
         
         However, the gravity of the conduct said to constitute the provocation must be assessed by reference to relevant characteristics of the accused. Conduct which might not be insulting or hurtful to one person might be extremely so to another because of that person’s age, sex, race, ethnicity, physical features, personal attributes, personal relationships or past history. The provocation must be put into context and it is only by having regard to the attributes or characteristics of the accused that this can be done. But having assessed the gravity of the provocation in this way, it is then necessary to ask the question whether provocation of that degree of gravity could cause an ordinary person to lose self-control and act in a manner which would encompass the accused’s actions.” 
         
        
       
       
       See  
       R v Green 
        (1997) 191 CLR 334. 
        
       
     21 The trial judge left the question of provocation to the jury in respect of the first stabbing incident but not the second. 
      
       
     22 The incidences upon which the appellant relied as establishing provocation arose at the outset of the confrontation between him and the deceased and continued until shortly before the assault on the deceased which led to his death. According to the version of events given by the appellant in the ERISP the incidents may be relevantly identified as follows: (i) the initial incident at Illusions; (ii) the incident near The Kings Cross’ Nightclub; (iii) the two exchanges on the return to Illusions; (iv) the pool room incident at Illusions; and (v) the incident on leaving Illusions. The period of time involved was of uncertain duration. To the extent it can be assessed from the appellant’s ERISP, the provocation occurred sporadically over about 2 ½ hours. From the evidence of other witnesses it was possibly longer.  
      
       
        
       Evidence of Provocation in the ERISP 
       
     23 The appellant first saw the deceased (whose nickname was Jewel) in Illusions nightclub, Kings Cross at about midnight. The appellant was with two friends, the co-accused Giri and another man ‘Noggin’. The appellant said that the deceased starting laughing at the way his friend was dancing and said something to him. He said that: 
      
       
        
         
         “then my [friend] went over him and I think he said, Sorry, and all these things…” 
         
        
       
     24 The appellant next said: 
      
       
        
         
         “and I got made(sic) with my [friend] and I told my [friend] when he was saying sorry to him because it’s not your fault. It’s his fault. … 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         … so I told him what, what, If he laugh, don’t apologise him, and I took my [friend] like this and I said, Don’t ever apologise. When you apologise, I just took him on the front and said, Do not apologise. Is no use apologising to him because is not our fault. is, it’s the way he’s laughing. Then being a really smart arse I went over to [the deceased] and said, What, what are you making so fuss about me, why don’t you talk to me, and all these things, and, and after that I can’t recall, and I, then I don’t think what I recall is, and he started saying, You want to fight and all these things. … and I say, Let’s not fight. If you want to fight, I, I’m alone. If I have someone, when, but I don’t want, it’s not going to be good and another bloke step in who was a good person. He said, No, let’s not fight. We are like brothers, why should we fight? We from overseas. I told him, O.K. Then it, it, somebody start, then I went out and I went to the Kings Cross discotheque.” 
         
        
       
     25 It is not entirely clear either from the evidence what period of time elapsed between leaving Illusions and going to and eventually leaving The Kings Cross’ Nightclub. However, there is some evidence to suggest it was in the order of half an hour. 
      
       
     26 The appellant said that when he came out of The Kings Cross’ Nightclub he “met those two guys”. It appears from the ERISP that these were the deceased’s friends Mahbubur and Islam. He was talking to them when, he said, the deceased came running up and said: 
      
       
        
         
         “You wanna fight? You wanna fight? I said, if you think you want to fight, why not? He goes, You wanna fight? You wanna fight? And he grabbed hold of me here. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         … right here like this and to my oesophagus … 
         
        
       
     27 Later he said: 
      
       
        
         
         … I also grabbed him but we didn’t throw any single punch at each other, but he was the one who attacked me, you know. … and later on all these guys were acting, and they were saying, Don’t fight, don’t fight, guys, don’t fight, why are you fighting and all these things. … Then he started running, you know. I told his friend that, I don’t want to fight, take him home, I said … these friends said he’s gunna take that guy to home …” 
         
        
       
     28 The appellant said he then returned to Illusions where he again saw the deceased. The appellant said the deceased said to him: 
      
       
        
         
         “You wanna fight, you wanna fight, and all this, and I said, Why don’t you apologise to me? He goes(sic), You started this because you made fun. He goes, I’m not going to apologise, let’s go outside and fight. I go, All right, let’s go outside  
         and then he didn’t wait outside 
          …”  
         (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     29 It appears the appellant stayed at Illusions for some time after this. Although the sequence is not clear it appears that during this period one of the appellant’s friend was ejected from Illusions because he was drunk. The appellant apparently left Illusions but then returned. His friend, however, was not readmitted.  
      
       
     30 Back inside Illusions he again saw the deceased: 
      
       
        
         
         “Then we had a big, how to say this, like, big stand off type of thing, then he goes, No, no and he goes, let’s go out. I said, Let’s, he goes, you want to settle down? I said, O.K. Let’s, I told him, O.K. We’ll settle down. … this is not going to happen any more, we’re going to settle down this and let’s go outside. And he goes, O.K. Let’s go outside, because being, he being more aggressive and more powerful than me on a build, I think so, he was more muscular than me, he goes, O.K like this, and I go, O.K if you want to fight, we’ll go, and when we go upstairs, when two of this friends come, then we, we started talking to him, and he goes, You know what, in Bangladesh I live next to airport and if you guys come there you will, the taxi, taxi will take you to my home without even asking. I’m so much popular and I’m such a guy, you know all these things he starts saying.”  
         
        
       
     31 The deceased’s friends then intervened: 
      
       
        
         
         “Then I think one of the guys was at the back and when he heard this he goes, Why you, why you making so big fuss? Whatever you are in Bangladesh doesn’t matter. We’re here. We are nothing. We are nothing here. Why you making so big fuss about everything? And he goes … all these things. Then we, and one of the guys was very good you know. On that one, when we started having this stand up with him, and I go to those two guys, I tell him, See, brothers, I’m, we not going to do anything and we, we just had a fight. Me and my brother who was not there. I said, We just had a fight with that guy, your friend, not, not, with you guys, you know, I requested like this with two [hand], like, I told him, No, please can you stay out of this? We just had a problem with that guy, not with you guys. Not with you guys. Why, why should we have a problem with you? You, you are, you haven’t done anything, you haven’t said anything to me. I don’t want anything to do, he is just wanting, asking, he, he started saying, I want to have a fight with you. That’s what, I just want to, if you want to settle down, let’s go, it will be all right because later on in my life, or later on in his life, I said Let’s not regretting all these things, you know, then to make the matter more better, so that it doesn’t accident any more, so that those guys take him home …” 
         
        
       
     32 The appellant said he showed them his security officer’s identification card: 
      
       
        
         
         “… saying that, You will respect a security licence, so that he won’t fight … If I’m involved in a fight, my licence goes. … so he started laughing as if he didn’t believe me. … But on the heat of the moment he goes, That guy was a really good guy. He said, O.K. We understand. … so after that I, I think I went downstairs and stayed there for a while …” 
         
        
       
     33 The deceased’s friends were playing pool in a downstairs room in the nightclub. The appellant went into the pool room and “stayed there for a while” and asked them to: 
      
       
        
         
         “Tell sorry to me. We’ll forget about it. What’s the big fuss? Because say sorry, my pride is still, because it wasn’t my fault.” 
         
        
       
     34 The appellant challenged one of the men there as to whether the deceased was “your friend”. The man said “No, I’m not involved with this”. The appellant then appears to have said to the deceased: 
      
       
        
         
         “…I told him, Just say sorry, we’ll finish this, Bro’. Whatever happened, we’ll forget about it. But he said, No. He goes, I’m, I’m not saying sorry, I’m not saying sorry. You guys want to fight, let’s go outside. These are his words. Then me at the heat of the moment, I also, I think I also said, You want to fight? Then why not, because I’m not going to lay down and take all these offences at me which you have directed towards me.” 
         
        
       
     35 The appellant said the deceased was drunk. The security officer at Illusions apparently approached the group and the appellant told the security officer that the deceased had “started all these things” and asked that he be put out of the club. The deceased, after some further discussion, was removed from the nightclub. 
      
       
     36 The appellant also left the club following the deceased, saying to him: 
      
       
        
         
         “Come on, let’s resolve this, this, we resolve all these things and all these things. He goes, No, we’re going to have a fight, and all these things.” 
         
        
       
     37 The fight, as a result of which the deceased died, then occurred. The appellant described what happened in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “And out of the blue nowhere, a guy comes running and they started charging, because the guy was, this guy was here, one of the guy was here, and one guy was here run from my backside. He goes, he slapped the guy, I don’t know, whatever, what happened. Then I go, I started running at that guy too. I started running at that guy and that guy, I don’t know. Then somebody hit him or something, and that guy was fallen down like this on the road and me being stupid, being what I am, I think I kicked him. That’s definite. I kicked him. … He started coming at me and so I just go, hit him once. Yes I did hit him like this. He fell down on the ground. And he, soon as he hit, he was ready to come up so I kicked him once.” 
         
        
       
     38 A number of further matters should be noted at this point. First, the evidence was consistent that the deceased was drunk to some degree. The appellant was also affected by alcohol, but not so as to be drunk. Secondly, it will be recalled that the appellant claimed that the deceased was of a more powerful build than he was. The evidence in that regard is not necessarily consistent. The deceased was 174 cm tall and 68 kilos, which would indicate a person of small to average height and of light to medium build. The appellant is 168-170 centimetres tall. There was no direct evidence of his weight, but as he was present on the appeal it could be observed that he was not of slight build. One of the witnesses, Mr Islam described the deceased as being about the same height as the appellant and both were well built.  
      
       
     39 I have, to this point, approached the matter on the basis of the evidence in the ERISP. I have done so as it might be expected that the appellant would give the best account of conduct which he claims, as a matter of law, amounted to provocation. Having reviewed that material, I have no hesitation in concluding that a jury properly instructed and acting reasonably would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that nothing in the conduct of the deceased amounted to provocation. Rather, the impression one gains from it was that both men were somewhat affected by alcohol; there was some taunting which on any view, would have to be considered to be mild; and there was a scuffle which was broken up by some friends. Further, there were some occasions during the course of the evening where the appellant challenged the deceased and there was at least one occasion when the deceased, having been challenged to a fight by the appellant, simply disappeared.  
      
       
     40 There was of course other evidence given in relation to these incidents by the deceased’s friends, Mr Islam and Mr Mahbubur to which the court must also have regard.  
      
       
        
        
       The Initial Incident at  
       Illusions 
       
     41 Islam gave the following evidence as to the initial incident between the appellant and the deceased at Illusions: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Jewel was dancing? 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, after a while one guy came to him and started talking with him. It appeared that they were arguing. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What happened then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. When the man left the dance floor, I went to Jewel and asked him what happened. Then he just motioned to go away from here. No worries about that. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         A. He kept dancing for another few minutes and then he asked to go out of the Illusions Nightclub and we went towards the Kings Cross Hotel.” 
         
        
       
     42 Mr Mahbubur said that the deceased was dancing and that: 
      
       
        
         
         “A. … I saw the man push for the Jewel 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Two or three times he pushed 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Could you see whether they were talking? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. Just I see the push and I was thinking maybe is Jewel’s friend or something.” 
         
        
        
       The Incident Near  
       The Kings Cross’ Nightclub 
       
     43 Mr Islam gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “A. … then the same guy was in the dance floor and some other persons in front of the Kings Cross Hotel. The guy was leaning on the rail over there and he came forward to Jewel and just asked, ‘Hey, you wanted to hit me there on the dance floor’ and I mean, the arguing started again and they hold each other, which I tried to, you know, separate them. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         A. They hold their neck and just trying to, trying to pull each other. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What part of each other were they holding? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I think the collar of the shirts. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         A. … I tried to push them away. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         A. At that time it’s fairly … in his hand, holding a small knife? 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         A. The same man [that spoke to Jewel on the dance floor]. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         A. Then I found a small cut in my finger by that knife.” 
         
        
       
     44 Mr Mahbubur had wanted to go home when they came out from the nightclub and he tried to get a taxi. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Next I saw the guy, which guy is pushed to the Jewel. He came follow for that place and he start again for the argue with the Jewel. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         … They start to again for the pushing. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         And they are for the pushing each other. At the time [Islam] is in and [Islam] got it, for the man has it for the knife, who is the push for the Jewel.” 
         
        
       
     45 He said after that he became involved in a conversation with the appellant and his friends. He said he tried to apologise to the appellant. The appellant said: 
      
       
        
         
         “… I don’t have any complaint about you and your friend. You both are, is good. You can go back home. But I want to see him. I want to hit him.” 
         
        
       
     46 The conversation carried on for some little time but was to the same effect. Importantly perhaps, Mr Mahbubur described how the appellant and his friends followed him and Mr Islam back to Illusions. 
      
       
     47 Again, there is nothing in this evidence which speaks of provocation. There was a minor incident in Illusions and a more serious incident in the street, however, the appellant approached the deceased on that occasion and restarted the argument. The appellant also pulled a knife on these two versions. Mr Mahbubur and Mr Islam then attempted to placate the appellant and his friends. During the course of that discussion the appellant spoke of “getting” the deceased, of wanting to hit him. At that time the deceased was no where in sight. 
      
       
     48 Neither Mr Mahbubur nor Mr Islam gave evidence of any other confrontation in the nightclub. 
      
       
        
       Incident on the Return to  
       Illusions 
       
     49 Mr Islam said that when they returned to Illusions, the deceased went inside. He and Mr Mahbubur stayed outside for a while and spoke with the appellant, his co-accused and the third person in their group, asking them to be friends. The appellant said to Mr Islam: 
      
       
        
         
         “It’s all right. We don’t have any problem with you. You can leave. But we are not going [to], I mean,  
         spare that guy 
          [indicating the deceased].”  
         Emphasis added. 
         
        
       
     50 He said that appellant then showed him his security officer’s card and library card. 
      
       
     51 Mr Islam said he then went into Illusions. He said the appellant and his friend went in and “they got some more people”. He said those people followed the deceased up the stairs of the nightclub which lead to the exit to Darlinghurst Road – “it was not less than 5, 6 or 10 peoples I think”. 
      
       
     52 Mr Islam then described the bashing. I will return to that later. 
      
       
     53 The evidence of those witnesses reinforces the view which I had already formed in relation to provocation at para 39. This was an exceedingly weak case to put to the jury on provocation. But the issue having been put, the jury, as I have already said, would not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that provocation has been established.  
      
       
        
       Self Defence 
       
     54 The appellant also claimed that on the Crown case, the defence of self defence was open to him. 
      
       
     55 In Zecevic v DPP (1987) 162 CLR 645, Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated at 661: 
      
       
        
         
         “The question to be asked in the end is quite simple. It is whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did. If he had that belief and  
         there were reasonable grounds for it 
         , or if the jury is left in reasonable doubt about the matter, then he is entitled to an acquittal. Stated in that form, the question is one of general application and is not limited to cases of homicide. Where homicide is involved some elaboration may be necessary. 
         
        
        
         
         … A killing which is done in self-defence is done with justification or excuse and is not unlawful, though it be done with intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm. However, a person who kills with the intention of killing or of doing serious bodily harm can hardly believe on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so in order to defend himself  
         unless he perceives a threat which calls for that response 
         . A threat does not ordinarily call for that response unless it causes a reasonable apprehension on the part of that person of death or serious bodily harm.”  
         (emphasis added). 
         
        
        
       Evidence of Self-Defence in the ERISP 
       
     56 The evidence of self-defence has to be considered in the context of the fight itself. Again, it is necessary to refer to that in some detail and it is again convenient to deal first with the evidence as it emerged from the ERISP. 
      
       
     57 The appellant said that the fight commenced some thirty to forty minutes after he had spoken to the deceased’s two friends and shown them his security card. 
      
       
     58 He said there was a lot of people gathering. Asked where the deceased was when he kicked him, the appellant said:  
      
       
        
         
         “He just lying floor, and he was going to get up so I just kick him so that he doesn’t get up or kill me.” 
         
        
       
     59 He asked what foot he was kicking with. He responded: 
      
       
        
         
         “I don’t know which one because I was kicking so fast.” 
         
        
       
     60 This answer does not sit comfortably with the appellant’s version that he only kicked the deceased once. 
      
       
     61 The appellant continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “He was trying to get up. I think he was like this so I just kicked him so that he doesn’t get up because everyone knows that he was the most strongest of all.” 
         
        
       
     62 It is significant when considering the defence of self defence to keep in mind that this was a joint criminal enterprise. It was not a case of one person against another. Even on the appellant’s version of events in the ERISP, three of them rushed at and/or attacked the deceased from behind, hitting him to the ground. The chances of the deceased being able to get up and put the appellant in fear of his life, when the appellant had at least two friends actively engaged in attacking the deceased, would be slim. Accordingly, even on the ERISP, I consider that the defence of self defence has not been made out. 
      
       
        
       Evidence of Islam and Mahbubur 
       
     63 The likelihood that this defence ever had any prospects of success is even further diminished by the evidence of Islam, Mahbubur and other eyewitnesses. Mr Islam described the bashing in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “… Jewel came out of the Illusions Nightclub and those people rushed behind him and I didn’t think that something is going to happen 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         … they followed him 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         It was not less than five, six or ten peoples I think. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         … I saw that they started bashing to Jewel, when I came out [of Illusions]. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         They all was on him, especially Ebis, Nitin and Noggin. [This was a reference to the appellant, Giri and their friend, respectively.] 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         They were bashing and kicking Jewel and at the same time I saw Jewel fell down on the street and it was heavily bleeding and the last I saw [the appellant] who was kept kicking him continuously. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. … you say [the deceased], you told us, fall down? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When he fell down did you see him on the ground? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was he doing anything, or was he just lying there? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Already he became unconscious. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         A. … the last person who was [the appellant], who was still kick him. I saw it very clear. … He was unconscious lying on the floor and the guy he was, just kept kick on his head …” 
         
        
       
     64 He said he also saw the co-accused kick the deceased. In all, he said the deceased was being kicked by possibly up to ten men.  
      
       
     65 Mr Mahbubur’s description was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “… I said, ‘Jewel, please I want to go home.’ And after we come out together, Jewel behind [Islam] middle. I come first. And all of guys follow us. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         After when we come outside and I try to the cross the road but the who’s pushed the Jewel, they tried to – Jewel just to walk and they try to catch for the Jewel and short guy he jump and he catch for the Jewel and started for the, his start for the fighting. Hit for the Jewel. And they take for the Jewel for the corner, close to the telephone booth and there is a happening start. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         The short guy is jump and because when he saw that Jewel is just walking and he jump and catch and he start everythings. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say he jumped and caught Jewel? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. From behind? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Behind. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did the first man, the short man, did the short man take hold of Jewel? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. From behind? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Behind. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         … they are hitting to the Jewel, Jewel bleeding … suddenly, I don’t know whose come and hit, hit for me. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Next is the guy, the both guys who’s start from beginning, all come and start to the fight, hit to the Jewel. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         … of a sudden Jewell fall down and they come and hit with the boot 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         They were punching, kicking.” 
         
        
       
     66 When the deceased fell to the ground, Mahbubur described him as bleeding. He was groaning and already “senseless”.  
      
       
        
       Evidence of Other Witnesses 
       
     67 There were several other eye witnesses to the bashing. 
      
       
     68 One of those, Mr Diolosa, was employed as a security guard at the Hungry Jack’s restaurant on Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross. His attention was brought to the fight by some screaming. In his statement to the police, Mr Dioloso stated that he saw one of the attackers, who on the totality of the evidence was identifiable as the accused, kicking the deceased as hard as he could, three to four times. Giri then pushed him away, but before both left, the accused: 
      
       
        
         
         “returned and kicked [the deceased] a further two or three times to the head and face … these kicks also appeared to be very hard. He then stomped once on the side of the [deceased’s] head with his right foot before kicking him once more in the face with his right foot. The last kick seemed extremely hard.” 
         
        
       
     69 In his evidence-in-chief, Mr Diolosa said he saw the deceased being hit by one of the attackers. He also saw the deceased fall to the ground, but did not see what caused that to happen. From where he was standing he could not see whether the deceased had attempted to get up. He said “they kicked him to death and they ran away”. 
      
       
     70 He described both the appellant and the co-accused Giri as doing the kicking. He said the attackers were “putting a lot of weight into their kicks”.  
      
       
     71 Although Mr Diolosa’s evidence-in-chief was a more abbreviated description than that contained in his police statement he confirmed the contents of the statement during his cross-examination. 
      
       
     72 Mr Diamond was the doorman at the Pink Panther Nightclub in Darlinghurst Road, two doors from Illusions. He said he saw four people emerge from Illusions – two were arguing. This lasted about five minutes. He said they walked up the street and then one man hit the deceased who fell to the ground. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         It knocked him out 
         , so it must have been a hard punch.”  
         (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     73 He said the deceased landed flat on his face. He was about ten feet away when this happened. He said the man who punched the deceased then kicked him and then “the other fellow started kicking him” in the head. He described the kicks as “hard” kicks. 
      
       
     74 Mr Diamond also described the deceased’s reaction to the argument he observed as the men emerged from Illusions as being “just [wanting] to get away from him”. 
      
       
     75 Mr Thompson was a resident of Kings Cross. He too observed an argument between a group of men. He said the group comprised seven to eight people. He also saw the deceased try to walk away from the group and saw one of the group approach from behind, run up and give the deceased “an open sort of slap”, a second man punched him and then “a bit further up basically en masse the group sort of attacked this guy and he fell, he went down on the floor”. 
      
       
     76 He described the deceased as not being “that interested in having a fight or anything like that” and that he did not fight back. He described the attack in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Basically the whole group … just really started a really frenzied kicking attack on the guy.” 
         
        
       
     77 He was then asked: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. When you say started a ‘frenzied attack on the guy’ what did they do? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just basically sort of going in and kicking him and then perhaps they’d sort of come back out and then sort of go back in and land another kick on him, sort of round his body, head, fairly indiscriminately.” 
         
        
       
     78 Mr Thompson said that there was a group of males kicking and the deceased was probably kicked about 20 times. He then continued the description as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “A. … some guy made some comment about ‘I’m going to get the police’ and the guy, the guy was in quite bad way, and the majority of the group sort of basically moved away and started to like, I think they probably realised this guy was pretty badly hurt and they sort of moved, the majority of them moved away from the guy away past Hungry Jack’s, walked up off in that direction. It was basically two guys left standing over the [guy] who was on the ground looking like he was unconscious at this point and one of the guys basically just stomped on the guy’s head three times with his right foot. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you [say] ‘stomped on his head’ what did he do? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just basically raised his foot up and pretty much with full force just stamped on his head.” 
         
        
       
     79 Mr Thompson was 2½ - 3 metres away when he saw the stomping. The description he gave of the two men who continued the attack after the others ran away fitted the appellant and the co-accused Giri. Importantly for present purposes, Mr Thompson described the appellant as the person who stomped on the deceased’s head. 
      
       
     80 Mr Page, who was with Mr Thompson, also described the deceased on the ground unconscious. He saw one or possibly two persons kick the deceased. However, he was not in the immediate proximity of the fight for the whole time as was Mr Thompson, as he had gone to an ATM and caught up with Mr Thompson when the fight was in progress. 
      
       
     81 Ms Taria was the on duty manager at the Hungry Jack’s restaurant and also saw the fight. She saw punching, the deceased fall to the ground, and she saw him being kicked and saw someone “stomping on his head”. She said two people did the kicking and one did the stomping. She said the stomping had occurred once or twice. 
      
       
     82 Finally, Mr Bayes gave evidence of seeing the deceased being grabbed, punched and then falling to the ground. He said someone started kicking the deceased in the head. He said the deceased was kicked quite a lot of times. 
      
       
     83 None of the witnesses gave any evidence of any attempted retaliation by the deceased. Rather, they uniformly described him as walking away from the appellant, of his being attacked from behind and once having been felled to the ground, of being “senseless”, or unconscious or lying on the ground groaning. A number of the witnesses also described the deceased as bleeding heavily. Further, given the evidence of the immediacy of the kicking once the deceased was felled and its ferocity, it was highly unlikely that the appellant would have been able to get up.  
      
       
     84 It follows that the defence of self defence could not have been made out on the evidence. 
      
       
     85 Once having disposed of those two matters, the question which remains is whether, on the evidence, the conviction was inevitable. In my view it was. Given the extent to which I have set out the various accounts I do not consider this issue requires a great deal of discussion. The evidence, including the evidence contained in the ERISP, was that the deceased was hit and was savagely kicked in the head and his head was then stomped on. On the totality of the evidence, including his own admission in the ERISP, the appellant was the main (or, on his version, the only) protagonist in the attack. It was he who was identified as having stomped on the deceased’s head. It is apparent from Mr Thompson’s evidence that the stomping occurred after most of the attackers had run off and when it was already apparent that the deceased was seriously hurt. The appellant continued the attack even as his co-accused was urging the appellant to leave. The evidence gave every sense that the appellant continued the attack to “finish things off”, the deceased already being senseless or unconscious and bleeding heavily. 
      
       
     86 The attack was, as Smart AJA said in Giri, obviously intended to cause grievous bodily harm. There could be no other explanation for the savagery of the attack. This was so notwithstanding that there were some differences of observation by the various witnesses. That is understandable. They saw the events at different times, from different places and at varying distances. There were also some changes in the evidence of the eyewitnesses from their police statements. Again that is to be expected given the lapse of time between the incident and the trial. In some instances the difference in the evidence worked against the deceased, as the police statement was more detailed. Mr Diolosa’s evidence was a good example of this. The other differences were not, in my opinion, critical. The consistency in the evidence of the eyewitnesses as to the appellant’s participation in the attack was, however, overwhelming.  
      
       
        
       Orders 
       
     87 In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.  
      
       
     88 HULME J: I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of Beazley JA in this matter. I agree with her Honour that the trial judge erred in his directions to the jury concerning the appellant’s failure to give evidence. 
      
       
     89 I also agree with her Honour’s remarks concerning the topics of provocation and self defence. No reasonable jury could have found in favour of the appellant upon either of these bases. 
      
       
     90 However, I am unable to agree with her Honour that the appellant’s conviction was inevitable. Thus this is not a case for the application of the proviso to Section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
      
       
     91 There can be no doubt that the appellant was party to a joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased and to inflict on him actual bodily harm. There can be no doubt that the victim was bashed a number of times on and about the head, that the appellant was present and had not withdrawn from the criminal enterprise when this occurred and indeed that he did some of this kicking. 
      
       
     92 There can be no doubt also that someone stomped on the victim’s head. Some of the evidence suggests this was the appellant but much of the evidence as to the identity of this offender was so imprecise or confusing that any conclusion that the appellant was the stomper was by no means inevitable. 
      
       
     93 But be that as it may, it does not seem to me to follow as an inevitable inference that any of the mental states necessary to sustain a murder conviction existed. 
      
       
     94 Apart from the circumstances of the fight itself, there is no evidence that any one intended to kill or do grievous bodily harm to the deceased. Certainly the appellant and his friends would seem to have been irritated by the deceased and resolved to punish him but there is a vast difference between an intent to harm and an intent to inflict not merely serious but very serious bodily injury. Indeed the difference is such that, making due allowance for the variations within humanity, it is difficult to think that any rational human being, even if affected by alcohol, could have formed the latter intent. 
      
       
     95 By parity of reasoning it is impossible to conclude that the appellant, prior to the fight, must have contemplated either the victim’s death or the infliction or intended infliction of grievous bodily harm on him. 
      
       
     96 When one comes to the fight itself, one must recognise that kicks to, or stomping on, a person’s head is not unlikely to cause grievous bodily harm. On the other hand, such damage is by no means inevitable, particularly if any kicking is done with joggers – the type of footwear the appellant seems to have been wearing. 
      
       
     97 One must also recognise that in the heat or excitement of an argument or a fight, people go further than they ever would on mature consideration. They lash out and say or do things without consideration of the consequences and with no intent which goes further than for example the making of a statement or the striking of a particular blow. Just as the strained relationship which commonly follows a heated argument is often, if not generally, unintended so in my view are not infrequently the natural consequences of the application of physical force. 
      
       
     98 Thus it does not seem to me that an inference of intent to do grievous bodily harm must inevitably follow from the circumstances of the fight. Furthermore, I can well conceive of the possibility that during the fight the appellant did not turn his mind to the possibility that one of the other participants might intend to do grievous bodily harm to the deceased or that the latter’s death would occur. 
      
       
     99 In my view, the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered. 
      
       
     100 BARR J: I agree with Beazley JA.

        Drew Anthony MOFFITT v REGINA 
        
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 STEIN JA: This is an appeal against conviction by the appellant, Drew Anthony Moffitt. On 8 February 2001 the appellant was found guilty of three counts on the indictment but not guilty of one count. The appeal is on the basis that the verdicts were inconsistent and the convictions unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
      
       
     2 The first count in the indictment alleged that the appellant, on or about 14 June 2000, detained the complainant with intent to hold her for sexual gratification. 
      
       
     3 The second count alleged that on 14 June 2000 the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent. This count was particularised as the appellant penetrating the vagina of the complainant with a hard object. 
      
       
     4 The third count was to the same effect as count two but particularised as the appellant penetrating the anus of the complainant with a hard object. 
      
       
     5 The fourth count alleged that on the same date the appellant did unlawfully cause the complainant to take a stupefying drug, namely temazepam, with the intent to enable him to commit a sexual assault on her. 
      
       
     6 The jury found the appellant guilty of counts 1, 2 and 4 but not guilty on the third count. 
      
       
     7 On behalf of the appellant, Mr D Stewart of counsel submits that the verdicts of the jury are inconsistent. He submits that there was no rational reason why the jury, having not been satisfied of the guilt of the appellant in relation to count 3, could be satisfied as to his guilt in relation to count two. The verdicts, according to the submission, defied the test of logic and reasonableness outlined in R v MacKenzie (1996) 190 CLR 348. The verdicts cannot stand together. Counsel further submits that the verdict of the jury on count 3 means that counts 1 and 4 are also verdicts inconsistent with it. 
      
       
        
       The facts 
        
       
     8 The following is an edited version of the facts summarised by the Crown. As I understand it, counsel for the appellant, who also appeared at the trial, does not dispute its general accuracy. Lengthy as it is, it is necessary to set it out in order to consider the appellant’s submissions. 
      
       
        
         
         The complainant advertised in the paper as a prostitute. On 14 June 2000 … [A] man named Paul rang her mobile and said he had a client who normally saw another lady (Julia) who was unavailable that night and asked if she would be willing to see that man for $500 an hour for a period of six hours. … The complainant told Paul that she could travel and told him to ring her back to write the details. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant later went shopping … for underwear and groceries, and Paul rang her again with an address at Crescent Head. He told her about the man being married to a barrister and that she could meet the man at the water tower so as not to go directly to his house.  
         
        
        
         
         Around 6:00pm the complainant smoked up to five bongs of marijuana then left to meet the man. … The complainant arrived at the water tower as it was getting dark, and she saw a man (the appellant) standing next to a white Ford. The man said, “New car, Julia?” The complainant explained that she was not Julia, and she gave him a false name, “Amanda”. The man introduced himself as “Bob”. He asked her to come into his car, … The man was wearing a beanie, a pair of glasses and a square band-aid on his cheek. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant took off her skirt (under which she was wearing hot pants) and sat in the front passenger seat next to the man who said the car was his son’s car, that it was unregistered and that it was his 45th birthday. He asked her if she would have a drink with him. She said no, but he persisted and said she could not let him drink on his own, so she agreed. He poured a drink from a Tia Maria bottle into two glasses, and she drank two and a half glasses. The drink looked milky and pinkish. 
         
        
        
         
         The man told the complainant that his wife was a barrister, that she was still home and that he wanted to go to a motel at Kempsey for a couple of hours before going to his house. … The man drove off and asked the complainant for a head-job, and she gave him one without a condom while he was driving. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant, at one point, looked up and realised that they were not on a familiar road, even though the man had said they were going to Kempsey, and she told the man to take her back to her car. She saw a sign saying “Gladstone”. The man told her he was about to come and to continue what she was doing, but she said no and he took out some money from his pocket and said, “ 
         Here’s $1,000. You know I’ll give you the rest later”.  
         She went to take it, but he put it back in his pocket. The complainant started to worry because she did not know where she was and no one else would know either. The man stopped the car at one stage … and suggested they have another drink. The complainant said no, but he persisted and she agreed, and she drank another glass.  
         
        
        
         
         The man continued driving, and they reached an intersection: “Kempsey 15kms, Coffs Harbour North”, and they turned towards Coffs Harbour. The complainant  
         “freaked”  
         because she knew there were no motels along the road there. The man kept driving without saying a word and she  
         “froze” 
         . He drove off the highway onto a dirt road, and the complainant tried to pull back the gear stick to get out of the car, but the man grabbed her right arm and said, “You don’t want me to hurt your pretty little face”. The man drove down a driveway and pulled up near a house. He got out of the car. The complainant hopped into the driver’s seat, but she then saw the man coming back to that side of the car and she jumped into the passenger side, and the man walked to her and grabbed her arm and pulled her out of the car. 
         
        
        
         
         They walked to a nearby caravan. The man opened the door and told the complainant to step inside, touching her on her shoulders from behind. She heard plastic on the floor. The lights were off. She stretched out her hands and felt plastic. The man walked her further inside and her knees hit a bed. He pushed her shoulders and laid her on the bed on her back and tied up her wrists above her shoulders. Her right hand was not tied very well and she managed to free her hand while the man had walked away, but when he came back he tightened it more. He then blindfolded her, and she could sense that the lights had now been turned on. The man asked her if she had any weapons in her bag, and she heard noises, which sounded like he was going through her bag. He then asked her if she smoked pot, and she said she did, and he told her to sit up, and she felt a bong placed near her mouth. She puffed on it then coughed, and the man told her she could do better than that, and she inhaled the rest of it. The man told her to have another drink and she felt a glass near her mouth. The drink tasted  
         “gross”  
         and she spat it out. The man said it was that drink or the cocktail she’d had before, and she told him she would have the cocktail. A glass was placed against her mouth, and she could see a milky drink with a pinkish colour through it, and she drank some of it. 
         
        
        
         
         The man then took off her pants, and as she was lying back she  
         “felt something inside my anus and my vagina. It was, it hurt”.  
         The man then started to shave her pubic hair. 
         
        
        
         
         That was the last thing the complainant could recall in the caravan. Her evidence was that she had not gone willingly with the man to the caravan, that she had not consented to any sexual acts that took place inside that caravan, and that she had not wanted to consume any substance given to her by the man. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant’s next recollection was of waking up in the passenger seat of the man’s car.  
         
        
        
         
         The complainant next recalled waking up in the driver’s seat of her sister’s car … She climbed into the back of the car and laid there for a short while before thinking that she had to get out of there, and she hopped back into the driver’s seat. She drove off (although she could not recall starting the car, and she could not recall what had happened to her handbag or keys, which were in that bag). 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant stopped the car near a phone box … She rang her sister and said,  
         “Rachel, you know, he raped me, you’ve got to come and get me. Please come and get me. Get someone to come and get me”.  
         She turned her head and saw that she was near a police station, and she told her sister she would be going there. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant walked to the station and saw a lady inside, and she asked her to let her in. The lady told her she could not let her in, and the complainant said,  
         “Please you have to let me in. I’ve just been raped”.  
         
        
        
         
         The complainant’s sister corroborated the evidence of the complainant in respect of the phone call received by the complainant on her mobile in the car. Sometime between 1:00am and 1:30am the complainant rang and said,  
         “I’ve been raped. My hands were tied and my eyes were covered and he took me to a caravan that was wrapped in plastic”.  
         At the time of saying this, the complainant was crying. The phone cut off and a couple of minutes later the complainant phoned again and asked her sister to help her and to come and get her. … Later the complainant rang again from the police station and said she was going to the hospital. 
         
        
        
         
         Constable Monique Turner was stationed at Crescent Head Police Station … Around 1:30am she heard loud banging, and she saw the complainant at the door, distressed and crying, and complaining of having been raped. She appeared to have been affected by intoxicating liquor or another substance. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant gave Turner an account of what had happened to her. The complainant told Turner that the man had gone through her handbag in the car at Crescent Head. She said that after getting into the man’s car, he drove her past his house to see if his wife was home, and he told her they would go to a motel after realising that she was home. When the man had asked for a head-job in the car, the complainant asked for $1000 first, but the man said he would give it to her when they arrived. After driving to the caravan, the man pulled her out of the car, wrapped something black around her eyes, tied up her wrists with a big belt and buckle and said,  
         “Don’t hurt me and I won’t hurt you”, 
          and he then walked her to the caravan. …  
         
        
        
         
         The complainant told Turner that the caravan was dark when she entered, and she had asked the man to turn on the lights. She had looked underneath the blindfold and saw the caravan covered in plastic. She noticed a lot of sex toys. The man made her drink something pink, and it made her feel  
         “strange” 
         . She could not move her feet and she was scared. The man told her he was going out to the toilet, and if she tired to get away he would hurt her. When he came back inside he  
         “did it with a dildo that had a condom on it. I don’t think he had sex with me himself, only with the dildo” 
         . … 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant told Turner that she felt like she had been drugged. Turner noticed red marks on her wrists. The complainant complained of being nauseous. She was unsteady on her feet, she was shaking, and her speech was slurred and becoming progressively worse. … 
         
        
        
         
         Senior Constable Sean Leehy was the officer called by Turner to attend Crescent Head Police Station on 15 June 2000. Between 3:00am and 4:00am, he saw the complainant … The complainant gave him an account of what had happened to her, and Leehy’s evidence was that she appeared to be slightly intoxicated or drug-affected, and that she was shaking and crying, and she asked for someone to hug her. The complainant’s account was similar to what she had told Turner. … 
         
        
        
         
         The statement of Senior Constable Cindy Simons was read to the jury, in which she stated that whilst Leehy had stepped out of the lounge room for a brief period of time, she remained with the complainant. The complainant told her that she did not know what the man had given her to drink, and that she had not wanted to drink it. She complained of feeling sick and wanting to throw up. She told Simons that the man must have dressed her in the clothes she was currently wearing. She gave Simons a brief account of what had happened to her in the caravan. After the man had  
         “finished having sex with me I was really nice to him”. … 
         
        
         
        
         
         Detective Senior Constable Brian Powick and Senior Constable Rodney Vandermaat attended a property at Barraganyatti around 10:40am on 15 June 2000. There was a house and a caravan on the property, and a white Ford. The appellant appeared from the caravan. Powick asked the appellant if they could look in the van and the appellant said,  
         “Yeah, help yourself” 
         . The appellant said he owned the van … An opened condom was on the floor in the caravan. There were sheets draped all over the walls. … 
         
        
        
         
         Vandermaat asked the appellant where he had been the previous night. The appellant said he had been there from 9:00pm. He said his mate owned the place and was presently away. The appellant was asked if he had brought a female there the previous night, and he said no. At the time of these questions being asked, the appellant was shaking and sweating profusely, and he drank numerous amounts of water. Again the appellant was asked if he was sure he had not brought anyone over the previous night. The appellant said,  
         “Well, you obviously know it was me. I did it” 
         . Powick noticed (on the appellant’s left cheek)  
         “sticking plaster … as though he had just removed a band-aid or similar”.  
         … 
          
          
         … The appellant was arrested and cautioned. The appellant was asked if he had any sex aids in the caravan that he may have used on the complainant, and he said he did. Rutledge saw the appellant enter the van with a police officer and later walk out with the officer holding a container with a number of items including vibrators, leather straps, a blindfold and a bong. … 
         
        
        
         
         The appellant was subsequently electronically interviewed … During this interview the appellant said that he had met the complainant on 14 June 2000 after seeing her Ad in the paper and arranging to meet her at 7:00pm near the water tower at Crescent Head. Whilst in his car the complainant became upset and concerned that they were not going the right way to Kempsey. He pulled over and tried to calm her, and he explained that they would not be going to a motel but to his son’s place. As they turned in the driveway the complainant grabbed the gear stick and tried to jump out of the car (A91 & A150). The appellant tried to calm her and restrain her because the car was still moving, and he did not want her to jump out and hurt herself (Q255-258). They then went to the caravan. He did not feel that he had taken the complainant against her will, and he had not stopped her from getting away (A182 & A259). It was her suggestion that she wear a blindfold, which she put on herself (Q99-A106). As they walked to the caravan he told her what he wanted to do (which included bondage) and she told him her fantasies, which included being raped and kidnapping a young lady and making her do various things (A113-114). The appellant told police that the complainant had agreed for her wrists to be strapped (A121). He also said that he had used the vibrators on the complainant, in her vagina (Q128-136). He denied having made any threats to the complainant, and he denied having forced the complainant to do anything she did not want to do (Q152-154). The appellant told police that he had arranged to pay the complainant $500 an hour for six hours, and that he  
         “wasn’t trying to rape anybody … or anything. I was just trying to have sex for nothing when it comes down to it”  
         (A164-165, & A172). He said that he had no intention of actually paying her (A172). He had given the complainant a false name because he had not intended to pay her, and he had placed a bandage on his face to conceal his appearance. 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence given by Detective Senior Constable Michael McFarlane was read to the jury. … There were two glass flutes in the kitchen sink with tan-coloured milky fluid. A bong was seen on the table (T 180). There was a used condom on the floor at the entrance. McFarlane also located two black leather wrist straps, a blue plastic vibrator, a green vibrator, a packet of sedatives, a grey beanie, a pair of glasses, a sleeping mask and a beige bandage. … 
         
        
        
         
         Dr Heather Williams examined the complainant at 7:30am on 15 June 2000. The complainant appeared dishevelled and shaken. Swabs and a blood and urine sample were taken from the complainant who was very distressed and uncomfortable as the vaginal swab was being taken, and she was reluctant to continue with further examination higher up in her vagina. Her pubic area had been shaved. The complainant gave an account of what had happened, consistent with what she had told Turner and Leehy. No injuries were found on the complainant’s body … 
         
        
        
         
         … William Allender, a forensic scientist, gave evidence that the results of the analysis reflected recent usage of cannabis, which would not cause a psychotic episode. Normally it causes euphoria and then sleepiness. Alcohol was not detected in the complainant’s blood. Alcohol and a tranquilliser drug (Temazepam) – which depresses the central nervous system and induces seep – was detected in the sample of milky fluid taken by McFarlane from one of the glass flutes in the appellant’s caravan. This drug was also detected in the complainant’s urine, as was a metabolyte of this drug. 
         
        
        
       Can the verdicts be reconciled? 
        
       
     9 In MacKenzie (at 367) Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         … if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. 
         
        
       
     10 For a recent comprehensive discussion of the general principles relating to inconsistent verdicts see Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL in R v Markuleski [2000 - 2001] 52 NSWLR 82. 
      
       
     11 An examination of the evidence leads inexorably to the conclusion that the verdicts of the jury may readily be reconciled. There was in fact ample evidence which could have lead the jury to support the verdicts said to be inconsistent. Their verdict on count 3 does not mean that the jury did not believe the complainant’s evidence. One obvious feature of the evidence is that counts 1, 2 and 4 were the subject of some independent corroboration in the evidence, whereas count 3 alone did not so have. 
      
       
     12 It is also instructive to examine the sequence of events and the various statements made by the complainant. The offences took place some time during the late evening of 14 June 2000. The complainant telephoned her sister between 1 and 1.30 am on 15 June 2000. She said that she said to her sister ‘he raped me’. The complainant’s sister said that the complainant said ‘I’ve been raped’. No mention was made of anal penetration with a dildo or hard object. 
      
       
     13 At around 1.30 am the complainant spoke to Constable Turner. The complainant said in evidence that she said to the police officer ‘I’ve just been raped’. Constable Turner confirmed this was said. Again, no mention was made of anal penetration with a hard object or dildo. The officer asked the complainant to tell her as much as she could recall about what had happened to her that night. The complainant responded in some detail and at some length. She said, inter alia, ‘he did it with a dildo that had a condom on it. I don’t think he had sex with me himself, only with the dildo’. 
      
       
     14 Between 3 and 4 am the complainant was seen by Senior Constable Leehy and Senior Constable Simons. The complainant told them ‘he did it to me while I was blindfolded with two dildos at the same time, I think he just penetrated me with the dildos, not himself’. At one point of time Constable Leehy left the room and the complainant spoke with Constable Simons. No mention was made of anal penetration. The complainant referred to ‘when he finished having sex with me …’. 
      
       
     15 So it will be seen that between 1 am and 4 am, in her complaint to her sister and conversations with the three police officers, at no time did the complainant claim that the appellant had penetrated her anus with a dildo or hard object. 
      
       
     16 It was not until after 7.30 am on 15 June 2000, when the complainant was being examined in hospital by Dr Williams, that the first mention of anal penetration was made by the complainant, when she complained of forced vaginal and anal penetration using a hard object. 
      
       
     17 His Honour the trial judge gave the jury a direction about how this evidence could be used. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         … because it occurred quite some hours after the complainant was first seen by the police, that evidence is not available to you as evidence of the fact. It is not evidence of the truth of what is asserted. Its purpose is solely as part of the history the doctor had to enable her to conduct a physical examination … 
         
        
       
     18 Another portion of Dr Williams evidence is relevant. While she took swabs from the low vaginal area of the complainant, she did not however take a swab, as would normally be done, of the higher region of the vagina. This was because the complainant was uncomfortable about the process and was not willing to have any more penetration of her vagina. Dr Williams did not examine the complainant anally. 
      
       
     19 There is an aspect of the complainant’s evidence at the trial which should be mentioned. The complainant, when describing the events of the evening, said that she felt something inside her, in her anus and vagina. His Honour then asked her if she was still lying on the surface she had been lying on before. She agreed or indicated that she was still lying on her back. It is difficult to know what the jury might make of this, but one possibility is that they would think it a physically difficult act to achieve. 
      
       
     20 The complainant also gave evidence of the appellant shaving her pubic hair. Dr Williams confirmed that her pubic region had been shaved. 
      
       
     21 The appellant did not give evidence. However, his ERISP was before the jury, in what was apparently an agreed edited form of transcript of the spoken word. During the interview the appellant was shown a dildo covered by a condom and found in the appellant’s caravan. He was asked if that was ‘used on the complainant last night?’ He answered ‘Yeah”. He was then asked, was it used in vaginal sex or anal sex? His answer was ‘vaginal’. He was then shown a blue vibrator also located in the appellant’s caravan and asked if it was used on the complainant. Again, he answered in the affirmative and said ‘just in the vagina’ [Q & A 136]. So, in the ERISP, the appellant was, in effect, denying that he used a dildo to anally penetrate the complainant. 
      
       
     22 One rather curious aspect of the trial is that the complainant was not cross-examined alleging that there was no anal penetration of her by the appellant. Rather, it was suggested to her by the appellant’s counsel, that the appellant used vibrators in both her anus and vagina but with her consent. It was also suggested to her by counsel that the appellant shaved the complainant’s pubic hair with her consent. 
      
       
     23 One more aspect of the evidence should be mentioned, which is directly relevant to the fourth count. That is the evidence that the analysis of the complainant’s urine sample revealed the presence of temazepam. This supported her evidence that she ingested the drug. This, together with the analysis of the sample of milky fluid taken from a glass found in the appellant’s caravan, which was found to contain temazepam, was powerful corroboration of the complainant. 
      
       
     24 When the evidence discussed above is considered, it is plain that the verdicts of the jury are not inconsistent in logic or reasonableness. There are clearly proper ways in which this court may reconcile the verdicts. It follows, in my opinion, that the jury performed its required function and its verdict should be accepted.  
      
       
     25 There was plainly evidence which supported the verdict claimed to be inconsistent. This includes the absence of explicit complaint of anal penetration until the trial. It also includes the absence of any independent evidence of corroboration of count 3, as compared with count 2 (Dr Williams and the complaints) as well as counts 1 and 4.  
      
       
     26 Since there was a proper basis for reconciling the verdicts and evidence to support the verdicts, it is not for the court to substitute its own view of the facts.  
      
       
     27 In any event, the Crown case was at its strongest in relation to counts 1, 2 and 4 and at its weakest with regard to count 3. It cannot be concluded that the jury failed to perform its function. It was well open to it to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the counts upon which it found the appellant guilty. Similarly, it was open to the jury to have a reasonable doubt as to whether anal intercourse took place as alleged in count 3.  
      
       
     28 As I have said, it does not follow from the acquittal on this count that the jury disbelieved the complainant generally, see Markuleski at [80-81] and [257-293]. All that the verdict shows is that the jury had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant on count 3. It should not be forgotten that the jury had a powerful advantage over this count. The jury heard and saw the witnesses and was in a position to make subtle conclusions as to the way in which the evidence was adduced, see Markuleski at [231]. 
      
       
     29 The verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 1, 2 and 4 were well open to the jury notwithstanding its verdict of not guilty on count 3. The appellant also faintly argues that the verdict should be set aside as unreasonable. The basis for this submission was certain internal inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence relevant to consent. They are not such as lead me to conclude that the verdict was unreasonable.  
      
       
     30 It follows that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

      REGINA v. VICTOR BARRY OLENIK 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: The applicant, Victor Barry Olenik, was sentenced in the District Court of New South Wales on 12 September 2001 by his Honour Judge Dodd for various crimes, of which two had been the subject of early pleas entered under s.51A of the Justices Act 1902. Those were the crimes of supply prohibited drug, viz., methylamphetamine, an offence under s.25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 punishable by a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment or a 2,000 penalty unit fine or both, and also that of supply prohibited drug, viz., cannabis leaf, an offence under the same provision, punishable, however, by a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment or 2,000 penalty units fine or both. 
      
       
     2 At that time his Honour took into account some six charges on a Form 1, the first of which was supply prohibited drug, viz., cannabis; the second a charge of goods in custody; and the third to the sixth charges of possess prohibited weapon. On the first count to which I have referred, his Honour took into account the matters on the Form 1. On that count he sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for two years and 11 months to date from 12 September 2001, that sentence to expire on 11 August 2004. On that sentence his Honour imposed a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 12 September 2001 and expire on 11 March 2003. His Honour ordered the release of the applicant on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. 
      
       
     3 On the second count, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for two years and six months to date from 12 September 2001 and to expire on 11 March 2004. It can be seen that the whole of that sentence is to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on the first count. 
      
       
     4 His Honour imposed, in respect of the sentence on the second count, a non-parole period of 18 months, which non-parole period was wholly concurrent with the non-parole period on the first count. His Honour similarly ordered the release of applicant to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. 
      
       
     5 Since the applicant had been arrested on 10 October but was released to bail on conditions immediately, his Honour dated the sentences from the day on which they were imposed, the applicant having been in custody during the period prior to the imposition of sentence. 
      
       
     6 The applicant seeks to appeal against the sentences imposed on a number of grounds set out in his Notice of Appeal. Firstly, that the court had failed adequately to assess the applicant's mitigating subjective features when imposing sentence. Second, the court had failed adequately to take into account that the offences were committed over a short period of time. Thirdly, that the court had failed to consider adequately the consequences affecting the applicant as a direct result of his involvement in the crime and adverse to him apart from the sentence that was imposed. 
      
       
     7 That last matter has occasioned some small difficulty on the hearing of the appeal. When submissions were being made before the trial judge, there was reference in those submissions by the Crown Prosecutor to there having been an order made under s.27 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. Reference was made to the applicant having paid what was asserted to be a proceeds assessment order in the sum of $38,000, as well as costs in favour of the New South Wales Crime Commission. It was submitted to the trial judge that that matter was not relevant to the determination of sentence, although it did operate to explain certain references in the documentary material that had been provided to him. Those references were contained in the Probation and Parole Service report and in the report of Dr. Wendy Louise Walker, psychologist. 
      
       
     8 At the trial, counsel for the applicant asserted that what had happened was that the applicant had been running a number of businesses, had sold some shares, and the end product of that was that, as far as one can now ascertain, he asserted the applicant had been unable to discharge the onus of explaining the provenance of his income and assets when an application was made for a proceeds assessment order under that Act. Reference was made to a failure to pay capital gains tax. Reference in particular was made to that matter in connection with the sale of taxi plates. Before his Honour, whatever the circumstances were in which the order was made were left entirely vague. 
      
       
     9 Before us the applicant, who appeared for himself, produced written submissions headed ""Subjective Evidence Not Fully Taken Into Account"" today to supplement the two written submissions, the first of 9 January 2002 and the second of 22 January 2002, which he had filed with the registry. In the submissions provided today, he asserted that his assets were frozen by the New South Wales Crime Commission, that this appeared to be a mistake arising from some unfortunate interpretation of the provenance of insurance monies received by him. However, he asserts in those submissions it seemed to him as if he might lose his home if he could not prove where all the money ""I had spent in the last six years came from"". His inability to explain the source of the money he attributes to the fact that he was involved in cash industries in the past 20 years. He says in his written submissions that having voluntarily supplied the Crime Commission with his financial documentation, he found it necessary to enter into an agreement with them to pay a total of $45,000 to the Crime Commission ""simply out of fear of what they could do to me"". He asserts that none of that money was money made illegally, notwithstanding there was some investigation of whether he had paid the appropriate tax. 
      
       
     10 Understandably, the Crown was not in a position to deal with this matter when it was advanced in that fashion by the applicant, who had not given notice of reliance on this particular matter. Today's proceedings were stood down in the list to enable the Crown to consider its position. 
      
       
     11 On resumption, we were informed by the Crown Prosecutor of various matters which might relate to the payment that it appears conceded by the Crown was made, but it was submitted that whatever be the basis of that payment it could not sound in any substantial manner to be considered in favour of the applicant on this appeal. Reference was made in particular to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Murray (unreported 29 October 1997), where Barr, J. categorised a payment, unfortunately not particularised as made under any particular provision of the proceeds of crime legislation, as sounding on sentence as evidence of some degree of remorse but otherwise irrelevant. 
      
       
     12 The applicant has sought to rely upon that matter it seems in his submissions on the basis of the payment being taken into account as part of the picture of his financial circumstances, and in particular, that it should be considered as linked, albeit remotely, to the offences, the link lying only in the fact that he has been occasioned this financial detriment notwithstanding that the moneys paid did not relate to the proceeds of the crimes charged. We are unable to ascertain the basis for that submission since it has not been possible to elicit with precision the facts concerning what the payment was made in relation to and how the monies paid came to be derived. 
      
       
     13 We have been urged both by the applicant and the learned Crown Prosecutor to deal with the matter having regard to the assertions made by the applicant as to the nature of the monies paid and the categorisation of them made both by the applicant and the Crown on the basis that we should consider whether in the total complex of matters to which regard should be had on sentencing, the trial judge fell into any such error in the upshot as would warrant this court interfering, having regard to its duty under s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
      
       
     14 That provision only permits this court to interfere with a sentence passed by a trial judge and impose a sentence in lieu in the event that the court is of the view that having regard to the proven circumstances of the matter some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed, in this case some other sentence more lenient. 
      
       
     15 It will be necessary to consider the short facts as they were before the trial judge and to consider the applicant's subjective circumstances as they were before the trial judge in order for us to ascertain whether the matters to which the applicant now refers were before the trial judge and sufficiently assessed by him or whether they being before us in the form in which they are that might make any difference to sentence. It is not necessary, therefore, for us to have regard to the principles concerning the tender of fresh evidence on appeal. Indeed, I understand that the applicant and the Crown have taken the entirely sensible attitude, having regard to the length of the sentences and non-parole period here imposed and to the time the applicant has already spent in custody, and to the potential relevance of this material, that they would wish the matter to be dealt with as best possible on the material available to us today. 
      
       
     16 I turn then to the remarks on sentence of the trial judge. His Honour found the facts as set out in the document entitled ""Facts Sheet"" to which his attention had been directed by the Prosecutor and by counsel for the applicant. Those facts were not challenged. 
      
       
     17 His Honour did not set them out in detail; however, he referred to the applicant having come to police notice when he was the driver of a vehicle which left the roadway and smashed into a tree. That gave rise to one of the matters which was before his Honour; that is, that the applicant had driven negligently. The police attended the scene of the accident and found him clutching a bag, which he refused to release. Upon searching the vehicle, methylamphetamine and the cannabis the subject of one of the matters to be taken into account on the Form 1 were located in the car. 
      
       
     18 Subsequently, the police executed a search warrant at premises in which the applicant resided and seized a number of items, including a set of electronic scales, a large number of plastic satchels, notebooks and notepads outlining what his Honour found to be details of drug transactions, 594.5 grams of cannabis, the subject of count two, two stun guns, 22 pairs of handcuffs, and two .22 calibre rifles, the latter items some of the items to be taken into account on the Form 1. A driver's licence in the name of Barry Kinnel carrying the applicant's photograph was located in his wallet. It is apparent that that name is the applicant's surname spelt backwards. 
      
       
     19 His Honour noted that in the collision the applicant sustained severe injuries, and those injuries required consequential surgery and caused permanent consequential incapacities. 
      
       
     20 The applicant took part in an interview with police on 10 October 2000. Admissions were made, to an extent, as to the activities of the applicant in supplying the drugs, the subject of the charges, and in respect of the other offences sought to be taken into account. His counsel did not seek to rely on some of the matters asserted by the applicant in that interview, and the applicant was not called to give evidence concerning those matters. In particular, it was not sought to rely on what he had said to the effect that another person was to blame for the majority of his illegal activity. But the trial judge was prepared to accept that the applicant ""essentially cooperated with the police in their enquiries"". 
      
       
     21 The trial judge proceeded on the basis that the applicant had entered pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity, the delay in the matter coming forward having been explained, firstly, by the extended period of convalescence from the injuries; and secondly, by reason of the matter not being reached on various occasions in court. 
      
       
     22 His Honour expressed the view that the applicant was entitled by reason of the early pleas to the full discount of 25% . The trial judge referred to the applicant's criminal record, which was extensive until 1971. Thereafter, there was no criminal record with the exception of a minor matter his Honour entirely understandably disregarded, until the applicant came forward for sentence on this spate of criminal activity. The trial judge expressed some difficulty in understanding why the applicant had reverted to criminal activity. He referred to the Probation and Parole Service report and a report from Dr. Wendy Louise walker, as well as various references, including from the applicant's medical practitioner. That material adverted to the family circumstances of the applicant and how he had been caring for young children who had lived with him and whom he had been supporting. He was concerned as to the fate of the children in the event he was sentenced to full time custody. 
      
       
     23 His Honour referred also to the applicant's gainful and industrious employment, and also to his having received considerable compensation in consequence of his having sustained personal injuries which had required a number of major operations and which appeared to his Honour to require further surgery in the future and to have the result that the applicant will be in chronic pain. 
      
       
     24 These matters it is clear had caused the applicant to suffer severely from depression. That depression, the injuries and the pain were confirmed by his former de facto wife. She confirmed his regard for his children. She confirmed, however, the gambling habit to which his Honour had made reference, which had occasioned the applicant considerable financial stress and affected the conduct of his businesses. The trial judge had regard, in addition, to the detail of the four total hip replacements and other injuries the applicant had sustained, to the references attesting to his honesty, trustworthiness and conscientiousness as a father; further, his willingness to deal with his gambling problem by attending Gamblers' Anonymous. His Honour further adverted to an unfortunate event in the applicant's youth which had contributed to his depression when young and which caused him, so it was said, to begin gambling. 
      
       
     25 There was reference in Dr. Walker's report to an aspect of the applicant's psychological history that his Honour had particular regard to. Dr. Walker referred to the applicant's compulsive collecting. I have mentioned the charge relating to the possession of prohibited weapons. One of those charges relates to possession of some 22 handcuffs. Such a charge would ordinarily be treated by the court, particularly if brought in conjunction with charges such as those here, involving possession of stun guns and rifles, as a matter of some considerable degree of seriousness in the context of the possibility these items might be an adjunct to an illicit business (see The Queen v. Mehcur [2002] NSWCCA at 56). However, Dr. Walker refers to the applicant having at one time purchased 50 toasters with a willingness to have bought more had the toasters then been on special in the context that it appeared clear to Dr. Walker and it was accepted by his Honour that there was a marked degree of compulsive behaviour. His Honour concluded that the collection of the handcuffs was an expression of this, so that it did not figure largely in the overall sentence. Dr. Walker also referred to the devastation suffered by the applicant arising from his conviction, disqualifying him from driving a taxi or running the driving school business that he had formerly conducted. 
      
       
     26 The applicant gave Dr. Walker an account of his involvement in the offences. It appears that his Honour did not accept that account as being an accurate and full statement of the applicant's involvement. However, his Honour did have regard to Dr. Walker's assessment of the applicant as a physically fragile man dependent on pain-killers, who had made quite an heroic change from his earlier criminal life into which, however, he had after so many years relapsed due to the imminent loss of his second wife. 
      
       
     27 His Honour appears to have accepted Dr. Walker's conclusion that the applicant suffers from major memory difficulties; that he may well have had a brain injury arising from accidents or a near fatal suicide; that he was sincerely remorseful, separate from being very afraid; that he is willing to undergo on going counselling which may have the potential to alleviate his suffering and may enable him to develop insight into his bizarre compulsive habit of collecting objects. 
      
       
     28 His Honour concluded, particularly in light of the concession made by the applicant's counsel, that exceptional circumstances such as might merit a non-custodial sentence were not present. He noted the submission that the applicant requires psychiatric treatment and that the hardship on the applicant's young family of a custodial sentence would be exceptional, but found against that submission. 
      
       
     29 His Honour accepted in relation to the rifles that their unlicensed possession was explicable by an oversight in failing to renew the licence. His Honour did not add any additional penalty in respect of those matters. 
      
       
     30 His Honour did conclude that some additional weighting of penalty was warranted in respect of the stun guns but did not reject the explanation that they had been purchased for some kind of protection as a taxi driver. His Honour did conclude that the false driver's licence and the possession of the 79.1 grams of cannabis indicated some additional weighting of penalty. His Honour did not find it necessary, nor has it been suggested here that he fell into any error in this regard, to quantify precisely the additional element of penalty. 
      
       
     31 His Honour examined the submission put by the Crown concerning various decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal to which he was referred but was unable to find that those decisions offered any useful comparison of any real relevance to his decision in the instant case. He turned to the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission and concluded that in his view, having regard to the principles enunciated by this court, a term of full-time imprisonment was appropriate in respect of each offence. 
      
       
     32 He accepted the Crown submission that there had been a substantial degree of trafficking, evidenced by the drugs stored at the house, being weighed at the house, bagged at the house and the records kept as to supply and delivery. He noted that there was evidence the applicant had been paid on at least some occasions, but he concluded as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Taking into account those matters, I however am unable to find that you are in the worst 10, 15 or 20 percent range for such offences but rather you fall somewhere toward the upper end of the remaining range for such offences. Accordingly, it seems to me the prison term appropriate in your case for each matter, and taking into account the matters in the Form 1, exceeds in each case the maximum term possible ... and therefore either of those options are available. 
         
        
        
         
         I note that you have not served any time in custody so far."" 
         
        
       
     33 It may be that his Honour had in fact fallen into error in the way in which he had proceeded to consider the suspending of the sentence or the imposition of it by way of home detention. It has been said in this court, following Regina v. Dinsdale (2000) 115 A. Crim. R. 558 in the High Court, that it is necessary firstly to consider whether a period of imprisonment will be imposed and, if so, the extent of that period of imprisonment before turning to the question of whether or not the period of imprisonment should be suspended, but I cannot accept that his Honour proceeding in the way he did has proceeded to the detriment of the applicant. 
      
       
     34 His Honour found special circumstances, in particular by reason of the need for treatment and assistance and that is what caused him to impose the non-parole period that he did. He made a recommendation for the applicant to be psychiatrically assessed as a matter of urgency and that the applicant should be afforded such appropriate treatment as might be available. 
      
       
     35 In the applicant's submissions before us, he has submitted, firstly, that his Honour did not take into account fully the necessary subjective evidence. Secondly, that the Director of Public Prosecutions overemphasised his involvement. Thirdly, that his Honour erred in having regard to the statistics. Fourthly, that the sentences for the various drug charges were imposed as additional to each other, even though the offences were obviously not separate. And that his Honour erred in fact in finding a substantial degree of drug trafficking. 
      
       
     36 On an application for leave to appeal against sentence, this court is bound by the findings of fact made by the trial judge, unless it is not open to the trial judge on the evidence before him to make those findings. It appears to me that there was clearly sufficient evidence to enable his Honour to make the finding of a substantial degree of trafficking that he did. Further, it appears to me that it was plainly open to his Honour to accept the submission of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to the degree of involvement of the applicant in the commission of the offences. 
      
       
     37 Having regard to the structure of his Honour's sentences and the non-parole period and to the principles laid down by the High Court of Australia in Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 103 A. Crim. R. 372, I see no error in the sentences imposed by the trial judge such as is contended that is that his Honour wrongly imposed an additional term of imprisonment for the two drug offences, notwithstanding they had been committed on the same day. 
      
       
     38 There is nowhere in the upshot of the sentences, having regard to the way in which they overlap, where the sentences are out of accord with the overall pattern of sentencing as approved in this court. The statistics to which his Honour had regard do not disclose that there is some such disparity between the sentence imposed in this matter and other sentences imposed for similar crimes as to suggest that his Honour's sentences are so far out of accord with the sentences imposed for such crimes in the exercise of judicial discretion as to show that his Honour's judicial discretion miscarried. 
      
       
     39 In this regard I have had reference to the written submissions prepared by the applicant and provided to the court today and to the graphs contained therein. In particular, I note that the applicant seems to have concluded that his sentence was higher than many of the other sentences received by reference to a fixed term graph which shows 100% of the sentences imposed in that way for similar crimes to be at the upper limit of the spectrum, but that limit is shown for sentences of unknown length. 
      
       
     40 The applicant suggests that there is some applicable mathematical relationship to be derived from the various sentences and some assessment necessary by the trial judge placing his culpability in some mathematical relationship to the culpability detected in other matters. It has been held again and again in this court that that is not an appropriate basis on which to sentence and is not the basis upon which an appeal might be allowed. 
      
       
     41 Reference is made by the applicant in his submissions to his cooperation with the police and the Crime Commission and to the discount he had received. It seems to be submitted that his Honour should have allowed, having regard to such matters as early plea and contrition, and in that respect I have regard to the fact that we were informed on this appeal that he had paid the money to the Crime Commission in the vague circumstances to which I have already referred, more than the discount of 25% . The precise quantum of that discount is the matter for the discretion of the trial judge. We have been given little additional information of any utility concerning the nature of the payment. What we have been given does not persuade me that the trial judge erred adverse to the applicant in any way in the discount which he had allowed to him. 
      
       
     42 The other matters referred to in the submissions provided today concerning the applicant's subjective circumstances are all matters which were before the trial judge and taken into account by him. It is perfectly clear that the applicant's financial and physical circumstances are most serious. It is also entirely clear that the applicant's young family is left for a considerable period of time without proper care and support. These matters were before the trial judge. 
      
       
     43 The court received from the applicant's 17-year-old daughter a testimonial in favour of her father dated March 16, which reveals an entirely estimable opinion by her of her father's regard for the family and his devastation caused by his mistake, but that is a matter to which, in accordance with the law, we can only have regard if we conclude that the trial judge had fallen into error. 
      
       
     44 I am not persuaded that the trial judge failed to have proper regard to the subjective matters because it is clear when one has considered the detailed remarks on sentence to which I have referred, that he has adverted to all necessary matters requisite for him to consider when exercising his discretion. Indeed, when one looks at the sentence passed by the learned trial judge for the offences charged in the context of his finding as to the culpability of the applicant's conduct, one could be forgiven for considering the sentences to be entirely lenient. 
      
       
     45 As I have said, it is only if the court is of the view that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed that the court is empowered to intervene. I can see no basis in this case on which the court should take the view that any more lenient sentence might justifiably have been passed. 
      
       
     46 I would therefore propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted and the appeal dismissed. 
      
       
     47 BUDDIN, J: I agree. 
      
       
     48 GREG JAMES, J: The orders of the court therefore will be as I have proposed.**************

      70004/02 R v Ricky Raymond MONLEY 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 DUNFORD J: The accused, Ricky Raymond Monley has pleaded not guilty to the murder of his mother, Patricia Lucy Monley, on 6 September 2001 at Merewether. He has elected to be tried by Judge alone in accordance with s 16(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The form of election has been filed, dated 7 March 2002, and the accused’s signature is witnessed by a solicitor who certifies that before making the election the accused sought and received advice from her in relation to it. 
     
      
    2 The only issue in the trial has been the defence raised by the accused of mental illness and, by consent, all the evidence has been tendered by the admission of written statements. 
     
      
    3 The accused was born on 28 June 1970, educated to Year 9, and on leaving school had a variety of labouring jobs. He last worked in about 1998, when he was placed on a disability pension for depression and schizophrenia. He has a longstanding history of cannabis use and intravenous injection of amphetamines and heroin. 
     
      
    4 The deceased was the 69-year-old mother of the accused with whom he resided in accommodation provided by the Department of Housing at Merewether. 
     
      
    5 Sometime between 3.30 and 4pm on Thursday 6 September 2001 a neighbour of the deceased, Ms Natalie Saunders, heard the deceased calling out the name of her fiancée, Eric. She sensed something was wrong because of the tone of the deceased’s voice and ran downstairs to investigate. She opened the front screen door and could hear the deceased still calling for Eric but, she went on, “it started to sound like a gurgling sound when she was trying to sing out to him”. 
     
      
    6 Ms Saunders ran down the hallway to the deceased’s bedroom and, stopping at the doorway, she saw the deceased lying on the bed on her back with the accused on top of her. As she entered the room the accused climbed off the deceased. She said to him, “Rick, what is going on, is everything all right?” The accused looked at her but made no reply. 
     
      
    7 Ms Saunders saw that the deceased was covered in blood, was making choking sounds and her front teeth appeared to be missing. At the same time she saw the accused holding what appeared to be a steak knife in his left hand. He had blood on his face and upper clothing. 
     
      
    8 About this time Ms Saunders’ fiancé, Mr Eric Pirnke, entered the deceased’s flat, noted the injuries to the deceased, and tried to revive her. In the meantime Ms Saunders summoned an ambulance. The accused attempted to leave the unit on two occasions but each time he was restrained and brought back. Shortly afterwards police and ambulance arrived. 
     
      
    9 Senior Constable Ryan approached the accused who was seated in a second bedroom. The accused said to him, “I’ve had a blue with Mum, I think I’ve killed her”. Shortly afterwards he was arrested and taken to Newcastle Police Station where a recorded interview was held. There were difficulties in the conduct of the interview with the accused not answering numerous questions and other questions were answered in a muffled voice. 
     
      
    10 In summary the accused said that he couldn’t remember properly what happened because he had been getting ringing in his ears which drove him mad and made him feel “not normal”. He said he only had two days to live because he had cancer, that there was a conspiracy against him, he had been poisoned by his family who put poison in his methadone and his food, lacing it with chemicals. He knew he was being poisoned because every time he touched something his mother and his brother Danny cleaned it up. He said his food and everything he drank had been poisoned. He was told to kill his mother; he was given directions to ""take her out”.  
     
      
    11 He said it should not have happened but it did “because of the bugs”. He got a knife from the kitchen. He said it was “really not my fault” because he was receiving signals from the bugs, “cause someone told me to give me the message to do it, to take her out”. 
     
      
    12 He said that in the days before the incident his mother had been driving him mad and making fun of him all the time and didn’t want him around any more. He maintained that people were poisoning him and when told he was to be charged with the murder of his mother, he said “How come everyone else is getting away with it?”. 
     
      
    13 On 7 September an autopsy was performed on the body of Mrs Monley by Dr Kevin Lee, Senior Forensic Pathologist. He attributed the cause of death to multiple stab wounds, puncturing in particular the left chest, damaging both lungs and the aorta. The injuries were consistent with infliction by a knife seen behind the bedroom door of the deceased’s premises and taken into police possession. He identified 15 separate stab wounds. 
     
      
    14 In view of the fact that when Ms Saunders went to the premises she saw the accused astride the deceased who was covered in blood with the accused holding what appeared to be a steak knife and with blood on his face and upper clothing, and having regard to the admissions made to the police at the scene and in the recorded interview, I am satisfied that it was the act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased by inflicting the stab wounds. 
     
      
    15 I am also satisfied, having regard to what appears in the recorded interview, that the stabbing of the deceased was the willed and intentional act of the accused in response to the so called “directions” and was unrelated to any issue of self-defence or accident. 
     
      
    16 Having regard to the nature and extent of the wounds as disclosed in the autopsy report of Dr Lee and the accused’s assertions in the recorded interview that he was told to kill his mother and given directions to “take her out”, I am satisfied that the accused intended to kill the deceased. 
     
      
    17 The onus of establishing mental illness is on the accused on the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v The Queen (1960) 105 CLR 659. The accused’s brother, Danny Monley, in his statement said that the accused had been diagnosed with depression about 18 months to 2 years before the incident, and was also on a methadone program. He was aware the accused had been previously admitted to the James Fletcher Hospital - a hospital for the mentally ill in Newcastle - over the past 2 years but was unaware of any diagnosis as to his mental condition. 
     
      
    18 He said that on 2 September, four days before her death, their mother told him that she was scared because the accused had threatened her, a concern which was repeated to him on the morning of 5 September when she told him that the accused had not been sleeping for the past few nights and had been walking around the unit. 
     
      
    19 Danny Monley had slept the previous night at the unit. In the morning he and the accused went off to get their methadone. Even though the accused was on a daily dose of methadone he changed his mind and walked off without it. The previous days he had told Danny he thought the deceased was trying to poison his food. Their mother had said that when the accused was better she wanted him to move out of the unit. 
     
      
    20 Four days earlier, on 2 September, in response to a call from the deceased, Senior Constable Paul Kremer went to the deceased’s address looking for the accused. He found him nearby and the accused said to him, “Are you going to call an ambulance for me because I am dying. She is poisoning me”. He also told Senior Constable Kremer that the accused had woken in a bad mood, thrown things around his room, and stormed out with the dog and had not slept for about 3 days.  
     
      
    21 It appears from Dr Nielssen’s report that on that morning (2 September) the accused was taken to the James Fletcher Hospital by police pursuant to s 24 of the Mental Health Act 1990. Triage notes indicate that he said he believed his mother was poisoning him. He was assessed to have a semi-urgent condition and would be of medium risk of harm to others. But, he apparently absconded at 8.05am and there was no note as regarding follow up arranged. 
     
      
    22 The accused was interviewed and assessed on 30 November 2001 by Dr Bruce Westmore who furnished a report dated 6 December 2001. This consultation was arranged and the report prepared on behalf of the accused. In that consultation the accused told Dr Westmore about the voices which he had been hearing for a number of years. He said he had been, since the age of 17, to the James Fletcher Hospital about 20 times “for speed psychosis”; that he had been on medication but at times did not take the medication. He said that the voices told him, “to kill me father, to kill me brother and sister but I’ve never acted on it. This time I did because I thought me Mum was poisoning me”. 
     
      
    23 Dr Westmore was of the opinion that at the time he killed his mother the accused was acutely psychotic suffering from a schizophrenic illness, this condition possibly aggravated by substance abuse and, in particular, he referred to the command auditory hallucinations and delusional beliefs regarding his mother and the acute argument which precipitated his attack on her. 
     
      
    24 He was of the opinion that he was suffering from a disease of the mind, specifically a schizophrenic illness, which would have totally deprived him of his capacity to know that he ought not to do the act which he did and that, accordingly, he had available to him a defence of mental illness. 
     
      
    25 The accused was also examined on behalf of the Crown on 27 February 2002 by Dr Olav Nielssen whose report is dated 22 March 2002. He related very much the same psychiatric history and the same symptoms as Dr Westmore. He had access to the medical notes of the Hunter Area Health Service which included presentations for what was described as substance induced psychosis from January 1999. Other assessments have noted a high risk of harm to self and others. 
     
      
    26 He was of the view that the accused’s answers in the recorded interview suggested the presence of disorganised thinking and auditory hallucinations affecting his understanding of the questions put to him. 
     
      
    27 He considered the admissions made in that interview were probably quite reliable as the account he gave is consistent with other accounts he gave of his experiences at the time of the offence. In Dr Nielssen’s view he is not sophisticated or intelligent enough to fabricate typical signs and symptoms of mental illness and his answers were not typical of feigned mental illness. 
     
      
    28 He went on to say that he believed the accused was acutely mentally ill at the time of the recorded interview, later on the evening of the day of the killing, and was probably not able to give informed consent to be interviewed, but the interview was of considerable assistance in establishing his state of mind at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    29 Dr Nielssen was of the opinion that the accused had a defect of reason in the form of a delusional belief that his mother was poisoning him arising from a condition recognised as a disease of the mind, namely an acute episode of chronic schizophrenia. He said that at the time of the offence the accused was experiencing auditory hallucinations of voices urging him to kill his mother who he believed was trying to kill him and that he was unable to reason with any degree of composure about his actions or recognise that his actions were morally wrong and he had the defence of mental illness open to him. 
     
      
    30 I am, therefore, satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time when he killed his mother the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind which deprived him of the capacity to know that he ought not to do the act or, if he did, that what he was doing was wrong: R v M’Naghten (1843) 10 C&F 200, 8 ER 718 at 722, Sodeman v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 192 at 215. 
     
      
    31 I, therefore, find the accused, Ricky Raymond Monley, not guilty by reason of mental illness and enter verdict and judgment accordingly. 
     
      
    32 I order that the accused, Ricky Raymond Monley, be detained in the psychiatric ward of the hospital at Long Bay Correctional Centre or such other place as may be determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

      70077/01 - REGINA v Anthony John SOUTHON 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: Anthony John Southon is charged that on 23 May 2001 at Gosford, he did murder Brian John Mackellin. Mr Southon has pleaded not guilty to that charge. He has, on advice, elected to be tried by a Judge sitting alone (s16(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986). 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    2 Mr Southon moved to his father’s home at Toukley towards the end of 2000. By early May 2001 his father had noticed that he was behaving oddly. He was difficult to understand. He spoke in riddles. 
     
      
    3 On 12 May 2001, police found Mr Southon at the site office of a land development at Warnervale. It was reported that he had been there all night. He appeared confused. He had dried blood on each wrist. When asked, he said that he had used glass to cut his wrists. He had done so, he said, because he could not sleep and wanted it to stop. He reported voices speaking to him. 
     
      
    4 Mr Southon was taken to the Gosford District Hospital. He was admitted. The laceration to the tendon on the right side required surgical repair. Mr Southon was fitted with a plaster cast on the right forearm. At the same time, arrangements were made to have Mr Southon psychiatrically assessed. He was reported by the night nursing staff to be awake, disoriented and delusional. His behaviour was described as disinhibited and inappropriate.  
     
      
    5 The next day, 13 May 2001, Mr Southon was again said to be delusional. He was cleaning the hospital walls. He stated that they were very dirty. He was observed to be restless and writing numbers on a whiteboard. The numbers had no apparent significance. The same day he was assessed by a doctor, who recorded the following: (Exhibit A page 24). 
     
      
       
        
        “Appears suicide attempt on basis of delusional ideas was unable to 'beat the drum at the end of the street so decided to kill himself'.” 
        
       
      
    6 On 14 May 2001, Dr Ashby examined Mr Southon. He was withdrawn and preoccupied with his own thoughts, with ideas of reference from the Bible. Mr Southon was then admitted as a voluntary patient to the Mandala Psychiatric Clinic of the Gosford Hospital. An EEG and CT scan were undertaken. Neither showed any significant abnormality. 
     
      
    7 In the days that followed Mr Southon was described by nursing staff, according to the hospital notes, as difficult to manage. He was said to be psychotic and disinhibited. On 16 May 2001, the day he allegedly attacked Mr Mackellin, he lay in bed naked. He covered himself with a sheet. He refused to get up and shower. He made inappropriate comments to nursing staff. 
     
      
    8 Arrangements were made for Dr Bardon, a consultant psychiatrist, to see Mr Southon. Dr Bardon did so between 4 and 5pm that day. The consultation lasted between 20 and 25 minutes. Throughout the consultation, Mr Southon rocked back and forth on his bed. He was excessively polite. His hands were clasped on his chest. He did not want to get up or unclasp his hands until “tomorrow which would be a brand new day”. He referred to the shackles on his ankles, apparently a reference to the hospital identification tag. 
     
      
    9 Dr Bardon believed that Mr Southon was in the elevated phase of a mood disorder. Stronger medication was required. He formed the view that Mr Southon, in his state of agitation, may not accept the medication he prescribed. He therefore completed a Schedule Form 2 under the Mental Health Act 1990 whereby Mr Southon ceased to be a voluntary patient. He could not thereafter leave the clinic of his own accord. 
     
      
    10 Nursing staff administered the injection at 5.50pm. Mr Southon, in fact, offered no resistance. Indeed he assisted by lying on his stomach so that the injection could be inserted into his buttock. He then got up. He had a shower and he got dressed. 
     
      
    11 At the hospital each night nursing staff undertake what is termed bed management. Rooms are prepared to receive new admissions in a way which will cause the least disruption to existing patients, if those admissions occur at night. This requires patients to be moved from their rooms to share rooms with other patients. Mr Southon was asked whether he would mind sharing a room with Mr Mackellin. Mr Mackellin was also asked whether he would object to Mr Southon. Since neither person objected, arrangements were made for Mr Mackellin to transfer to the room occupied by Mr Southon, room 7. The transfer took place at approximately 7.30pm. 
     
      
       
      The assault 
       
      
    12 The circumstances in which Mr Mackellin was seriously assaulted are not in doubt. At approximately 7.45pm nursing staff heard a noise coming from the vicinity of room 7. The noise was a series of three blows in quick succession. So forceful were the blows that some staff members felt the vibration through the floor. Nurse Garry Stanton and Nurse Karen Martin rushed to room 7. Mr Stanton described what he saw in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “I saw Anthony kneeling on the bed at the foot of the bed. Anthony’s back was facing me. Brian was lying across the bed. His head was closest to the wall and his legs were hanging off the side of the bed. I saw that Brian was apparently unconscious.”  
        
       
      
    13 Anthony is, of course, a reference to the accused Mr Southon. Brian is the deceased, Mr Brian Mackellin. 
     
      
    14 Nurse Martin described what she saw in similar terms. Nurse Stanton activated the duress alarm. He used his right shoulder to push Mr Southon away from Mr Mackellin. Mr Southon did not resist. He left the room, making his way to the toilet. Frantic, indeed heroic, efforts were made to revive Mr Mackellin. He was ultimately transferred, still unconscious, to the intensive care unit of the Gosford Hospital. 
     
      
    15 Mr Mackellin had suffered significant injuries. They included a fracture to his nasal bone and his right maxilla. From the blood spatter it appeared that his head had been smashed against the wall. He was bleeding profusely. He suffered cardiac arrest, apparently through blood having obstructed his upper airway and the possible effects of asphyxiation due to neck compression. In the days that followed, Mr Mackellin remained in a coma on life support. It was clear that he had suffered significant and irreversible brain damage. On 22 May 2001 the decision was taken to withdraw the life support. Mr Mackellin died the next day, 23 May 2001. 
     
      
    16 Returning to Mr Southon, and 16 May, having fled to the toilet, Mr Southon was ultimately arrested. When arrested his plaster had been removed. It was recovered from the toilet. It was covered in blood. The nightshirt he was wearing was also covered with blood on the front right hand side. Mr Southon has, on advice, admitted that he assaulted Mr Mackellin (s184 Evidence Act 1995 (Exhibit D)). I have no doubt that he did so. 
     
      
       
      Self defence 
       
      
    17 Mr Southon remained in the toilet for some time. He could be heard in the corridor outside pacing up and down, muttering. Police came to the hospital. They spoke to Mr Southon through the bathroom door. They asked him to lie on the floor whilst they entered. He did so. Once outside the room, Senior Constable Haldane had the following conversation with Mr Southon: 
     
      
       
        
        “I said 'What did you do?' The defendant said 'I bashed him. He asked me for cigarettes. I didn’t have any. He came at me and I bashed him'. I said 'What did you use?' He raised his arm and he said 'I had a cast, I used that' and he indicated the corner of the bathroom where I saw on the shelf what appeared to be a pile of bandages. There was blood on the bandages. I said 'Okay don’t say any more'.” 
        
       
      
    18 Mr Southon was taken to the Gosford Police Station. The police said they wished to interview him on video. Mr Southon responded, according to Constable Hill, with these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “You’re wasting your time mate. All I remember is that he asked me for a cigarette and I said I didn’t have any and then he must have hit me and I must have hit him. That’s all I can tell you.” 
        
       
      
    19 My attention has been drawn to the Crimes Amendment (Self Defence) Act 2001 which operates in respect of trials after 22 February 2001 and therefore has application to this trial. The Crown is obliged to exclude, beyond reasonable doubt, the reasonable possibility that Mr Southon’s account, or his various accounts to the police, may possibly be true or accurate. I am satisfied that the Crown has discharged that onus. I have reached that view for a number of reasons. First, I accept the evidence of Nurses Stanton and Martin. Their description of Mr Southon straddling Mr Mackellin suggests that, at least at that point, Mr Southon was the aggressor.  
     
      
    20 Secondly, Mr Southon did not sustain injuries apart from swelling to the knuckles. That swelling was consistent with Mr Southon having struck Mr Mackellin. 
     
      
    21 Thirdly, Mr Mackellin’s fists were examined, as reported by Detective Cremen. They showed no injuries. I infer that Mr Mackellin did not strike Mr Southon. 
     
      
    22 Fourthly, the victim was unarmed. Mr Southon was not conventionally armed, but had a plaster cast, which he acknowledged that he used. 
     
      
    23 Fifthly, the assertion by Mr Southon that Mr Mackellin asked him for a cigarette and then reacted angrily when he refused to provide one is implausible. Mr Mackellin had cigarettes. They had been delivered by his wife that day. They were given to him shortly after lunch. The reaction described by Mr Southon would have been entirely out of character for Mr Mackellin. Mr Mackellin was well known to the staff of the Mandala Clinic. He had been admitted on a number of occasions suffering from depression. He was described by everyone as mild-mannered and gentle. He was not given to anger. His wife said that he was placid. He spoke to his wife between 5 and 6pm that evening. He said to her that he was feeling much better. 
     
      
    24 Mr Southon, in contrast, had been agitated throughout that day. Allthough it was thought that he had settled after the injection, it is plain that he had not. He had been the subject of a Schedule Form 2 signed by Dr Bardon that afternoon. 
     
      
    25 No submission has been made on behalf of Mr Southon that self defence has not been excluded. I find that the Crown has excluded self defence beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
       
      Provocation 
       
      
    26 No suggestion has been made on behalf of Mr Southon that the assault was occasioned in circumstances of provocation on the part of Mr Mackellin. When Mr Mackellin was found, he was partly undressed. The belt of his jeans was undone. The jeans themselves were partway down his legs. There is no eye-witness account of the events immediately before Mr Southon’s assault. However there is no evidence of provocation. The state of Mr Mackellin’s dress is entirely consistent with his beginning of the process of getting into bed, it being quite late. Mr Southon, in his conversations with nursing staff and with police immediately after the incident, did not suggest any provocative conduct on the part of the deceased. I therefore exclude, beyond any doubt, provocation. 
     
      
       
      Intoxication 
       
      
    27 Mr Southon was interviewed by a number of doctors after Mr Mackellin’s death in the search for reasons for his behaviour. Part of the history he provided included the suggestion that he had taken the drug Zyban. Zyban is an anti-depressant. It is marketed as a drug that will assist those trying to give up cigarettes. Mr Southon told Dr Nielssen that about six weeks before 16 May he began taking Zyban. He had been provided with an almost full packet by a friend. He said that he took it every day for a few weeks. 
     
      
    28 The issue was examined by Dr Westmore and Dr Mastroianni, to whom Mr Southon was referred. The history provided by Mr Southon to those doctors was not always consistent. He told Dr Mastroianni that he ceased taking Zyban a week before 16 May. He told Dr Westmore that he ceased taking the drug two days before a head injury. The injury occurred between one week or perhaps two weeks before the incident. 
     
      
    29 The Crown sought an opinion from Professor Mitchell, the Professor of Psychiatry at the University of New South Wales, as to the possible association between the Zyban and the psychiatric disturbance Mr Southon appeared to have suffered. Professor Mitchell, in a report, quoted from the Australian Product Information, obtained from the manufacturer, which was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Zyban may precipitate a manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder during the depressed phase of their illness. It may activate latent psychosis in other susceptible individuals.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    30 Professor Mitchell said that the possibility of Zyban having contributed to the psychotic reaction or violent behaviour of Mr Southon could not be excluded. 
     
      
    31 Zyban is a drug which is only available on prescription. Where, as in this case, it is obtained otherwise than on prescription, its ingestion is self-induced intoxication (s428A Crimes Act 1900). Nonetheless, murder being a crime of specific intent, intoxication whether self-induced or otherwise, may be taken into account (s428C Crimes Act). It may not be taken into account in respect of manslaughter (s428E). 
     
      
    32 A blood sample was taken from Mr Southon shortly after his arrest. Analysis of the sample did not reveal Zyban in Mr Southon’s blood. That does not necessarily exclude its role as a precipitant of psychosis. However, it appears an unlikely cause in Mr Southon’s case. Dr Nielssen gave the following evidence, which I accept: (T22) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So once the mind is, if I can use the word generally disturbed, as a result of such a drug, if there is indeed such effect taking place, then that disturbance can continue beyond the life of the drug within the body? 
         
        A. Yes, but again I think it is unlikely that Zyban was the cause because the history I elicited was of taking it intermittently some weeks before the onset of symptoms, so if it was a factor it was a very minor factor.” 
        
       
      
    33 Intoxication has not been raised as an issue on behalf of Mr Southon. Such evidence as there is relating to intoxication appears to me to be slight, given the blood test and given the opinion which I have accepted of Dr Nielssen. 
     
      
    34 I am satisfied, as I have said, that Mr Southon did, as he acknowledged, severely assault Mr Mackellin on 16 May 2001, thereby leading to his death on 23 May. I am further satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did so in circumstances which I would infer, from the circumstances of the assault (subject to the defence of mental illness), was with the appropriate intent. 
     
      
    35 I therefore believe that the Crown has established the elements of murder subject to the defence of mental illness to which I now turn. 
     
      
       
      The defence of mental illness 
       
      
    36 Section 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 provides that, where a person is not responsible according to law for his or her actions a jury or, in this case a Judge sitting alone, must return a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness. The section adopts and incorporates the pre-existing law which is known as the M'Naghten Rules (R v M'Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718) expressed by Lord Justice Tindal in these words: (at 723) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... we have to submit our opinion to be, that the jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong."" 
        
       
      
    37 The onus is upon the accused upon the balance of probabilities (see also R v Porter (1935) 55 CLR at 182 by Dixon J). 
     
      
    38 Here Mr Southon has been examined by three forensic psychiatrists, Doctors Westmore and Mastroianni on behalf of Mr Southon, and Doctor Nielssen on behalf of the Crown. Each doctor, with varying degrees of emphasis, has supported the defence of mental illness. Doctor Westmore said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of his mental state around the time of the incident he reports that he was receiving special messages from the radio, newspapers, and television. He believed people could read his thoughts and he had self harmed. He described his energy levels as being both high and low and that he had abnormal auditory experiences. Investigations are reported to have been normal.” 
        
       
      
    39 Doctor Westmore expressed the view that Mr Southon was, as a matter of probability, mentally ill at the time of the incident. He found it difficult to express a view on the precise issues which must be addressed in the context of this defence. However, he believed “the issue of mental illness should be put to the court for its consideration”. 
     
      
    40 Doctor Mastroianni was rather more definite. Mr Southon has been held at Long Bay Prison Psychiatric Hospital since shortly after his arrest. Doctor Mastroianni is a consultant to that hospital. He has had the advantage of seeing Mr Southon each week since his arrest. Doctor Mastroianni noted the assessment of the psychiatric registrar upon Mr Southon’s admission to that hospital on 19 May 2001. The assessment was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Too thought disordered to give adequate history. Marked self neglect, withdrawn with moderate psycho motor retardation. At times perplexed, marked poverty of speech with frequent thought blocking and tangentiality, stating ‘I just want to beat the drum’. Believes he can read other people’s minds, receives messages from TV, but they were garbled and distressing. Interpreted them as telling him to be loving and kind, but before he attempted suicide they became bad and upsetting. Believes a higher power at times controlling him. No insight. Poor judgment.” 
        
       
      
    41 Doctor Mastroianni diagnosed schizophreniform psychosis, which is a disease of the mind. It combines the symptoms of schizophrenia, but does not satisfy one aspect of the definition of that disease, which is that the symptoms must endure for a period of six months. 
     
      
    42 Doctor Mastroianni believed that Mr Southon’s judgment and behaviour were significantly affected by mental illness. Dr Mastroianni said this in his report of 19 November 2001 and I quote: 
     
      
       
        
        “From a psychiatric point of view Mr Southon meets the criteria for McNaughton’s 
          
        Rules for a defence of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) He was disordered in the mind by virtue of his psychotic symptoms;  
        
       
       
        
        (2) His psychotic symptoms arose from a disease of the mind diagnosed as schizophreniform psychosis; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) That although Mr Southon would normally have known that the act he was committing was wrong, his mental illness symptoms significantly impaired his judgment to be able to appreciate the nature and quality of his act and its wrongfulness."" 
        
       
      
    43 Dr Mastroianni has continued to see Mr Southon at the prison hospital. Mr Southon has not displayed evidence of psychosis since August 2001. Medication ceased in January 2002. He has not had a recurrence of thought disorder or mood instability since the withdrawal of medication, which is a positive sign for his future. Further observation however is necessary before it can be said that relapse is unlikely. 
     
      
    44 Dr Olav Nielssen examined Mr Southon on behalf of the Crown. He prepared a report dated 26 February 2002. Dr Nielssen also formed the view that schizophreniform psychosis, an acute mental illness, was the most likely diagnosis. Dr Nielssen said this in his report: 
     
      
       
        
        “However despite the absence of a clear link between psychotic symptoms and Mr Southon’s behaviour it is clear that he was acutely mentally ill at the time of the offence and in my opinion has the defence of mental illness open to him. He was affected by an acute psychotic episode which is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. The illness resulted in a defect of reason in the form of disorganised thinking, the experience of perceptual disturbances he took to be real, the effect of extreme fluctuations in mood and several delusional beliefs. It was Mr Southon’s first episode of mental illness and he had no previous experience to help him understand the symptoms which, in combination with the severity of symptoms left him unable to reason with composure about his actions, to realise that what he was doing was morally wrong or to control his actions."" 
        
       
      
    45 I accept the evidence of Dr Mastroianni and Dr Nielssen and, so far as it goes, that of Dr Westmore. I am persuaded therefore, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Southon, at the time he attacked Mr Mackellin, suffered from such a defect of reason by reason of disease of the mind so as to not to know the nature and quality of his act or, if he did know, not to appreciate that it was wrong. 
     
      
       
      Just before I go to the order that should be made, are there any particular matters that I should include in the judgment first Mr Crown? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour on the consideration of some of the directions I don’t know that your Honour need specifically-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I didn’t advert to s165 and hearsay. In this case I put on the record, I don’t think I need include it in the judgment, that I am conscious of the fact that the hospital notes are in the nature of hearsay. Nonetheless they are a continuous record and in the circumstances I regard them for my purposes as a reliable record, I am conscious of the potential for unreliability. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour the only, I think, other issues related to the silence of the accused when spoken to by police and also the election not to give evidence-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. Perhaps when I get the judgment back I will incorporate into the judgment a reference to the fact that Mr Southon has not given evidence before me. However I draw no adverse inference from that fact and the issues have been dealt with based on the evidence that’s been placed before me. I do not believe that I need otherwise repeat the formula which is in  
      Azzopardi 
       but I am conscious of it. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour. I think the only other thing, perhaps for abundant caution your Honour, is just to note s37 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act which is a mandatory section that a jury at least be informed of the consequences of a finding of-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I had intended to make an order and then to perhaps explain to Mr Southon that the matter will then go before the Mental Health Review Tribunal for review from time to time and there is a procedure which is established. I do not know that I need go into that in great detail. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: ...(not transcribable).. suffice. Yes, thank you your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I will give the explanation and if it needs to be supplemented then you might assist me. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Ms Loukas is there something? 
       
       
      LOUKAS: Yes. Just in relation to I think the last matter that my friend raised in relation to your Honour having to direct yourself in terms of the explanation of the provisions under the Mental Health Act. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes I had better get it. I haven't got it here. Has anyone got it readily-- 
       
       
      LOUKAS: I think I have it here. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I noticed in one of the judgments you handed to me,  
      Gillett, 
       James J perhaps I can conveniently call him, incorporates that passage-- 
       
       
      LOUKAS: Yes that’s s37 your Honour, Explanation to the Jury. I have a copy of that if your Honour requires it. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes if you could I will be grateful. 
       
       
      LOUKAS: Your Honour I’ve done some underlinings on the page. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: That I am sure is helpful. 
       
       
      LOUKAS: Thank you your Honour. Yes, as my friend has indicated, s37 is the form of the direction one would normally give to a jury. In the circumstances of a Judge alone trial it would be appropriate for your Honour to direct yourself in those terms. That’s the only application I would be making in terms of the directions your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Thank you. I will just take a moment to read this. In many ways I think I can well understand why, in a summing-up where there is a jury, a Judge would include that, because the jury might feel some diffidence in embracing the defence because they would be worried about what might happen were they to return that verdict. 
       
       
      LOUKAS: Indeed your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I think in this case I am certainly conscious of that section, and the appropriate time to deal with it is after I complete the judgment and in an explanation to Mr Southon of what will happen in the future. 
       
       
      LOUKAS: Make the relevant order. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
       
       
      LOUKAS: Thank you your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: In the circumstances I make the following order. 
       
       
      Order 
       
      
    46 I therefore find that the accused, Mr Southon, is not guilty by reason of mental illness. I order that you be detained at Long Bay Prison Hospital and thereafter in such other places as are determined according to law until you are released by due process of law. 
     
      
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr Southon, to explain that order, there is as you may know a body known as the Mental Health Review Tribunal. That body consists of a number of individuals, some of them with psychiatric qualifications, some of them with legal qualifications, who periodically review the orders that are made of persons such as yourself who are detained pursuant to an order of the sort that I have just made, and they review the mental health of those persons and they make recommendations by reference to the psychiatric health of the individual with whom they are dealing and in accordance with s39 of the Act, that is the Mental Health Act. 
       
       
      The Tribunal may make a recommendation for the release of the person detained, if satisfied on the evidence available to it, that the safety of the person or any member of the public, would not be seriously endangered by the person’s release. 
       
       
      So that the effect of my order is, therefore, that you are found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness but that you are detained; that you will be periodically reviewed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal and that that Tribunal, depending upon the evidence as to your mental health, may make a recommendation as to your release if they believe that you are not a danger to yourself or to other members of the public. Do you understand that? 
       
       
      ACCUSED: Yes I do. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: All right, well you might sit down. Well it remains for me simply to say to both families that I am sure that this is a tragic event, and I can see from your numbers, from every perspective. And that each of you in your separate ways has been through hell and one can only sympathise with you. But I am sure the members of the family of Mr Mackellin, who on all accounts was a gentle and decent man, I am sure you would understand the nature of the judgment that I have given and the pernicious or the vicious quality of mental illness which so afflicted Mr Southon on this occasion. And I therefore think it appropriate to say that to each family. All right is there anything else Mr Crown? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, just a couple of matters. The Crown does have a victim impact statement prepared by the wife of the deceased. Your Honour, under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, before a victim impact statement can be presented to a court under the Act, there must be a conviction. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Now in such a matter and in such a finding as we have here, obviously there is no conviction. And I do not know if my friend has yet had time to get instructions about that but I had raised with her earlier today the possibility that one might be handed up by consent. Of course the law is that your Honour cannot take it into account-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: --any sentencing and of course this is not really a matter for sentencing. But subject to what my friend’s instructions are, I thought that might be an appropriate course to take. If her instructions are contrary to that proposal then I would have nothing further to add on that. Perhaps while she is discussing that with Mr Southon, your Honour, the only other issue I wanted to raise a little bit unusually, but nevertheless it struck me as being appropriate, as I read through the brief your Honour I would have to say that I was struck by the selflessness of two persons in particular, as well as a number of others that were involved in the Crash Team at the hospital. But of particular note, it seemed to me going through the statements, were Mark Joyce who was the nursing unit manager, who seems to have seized control of the situation very effectively. He administered mouth to mouth to Mr Mackellin whilst Mr Mackellin himself was clearly bleeding in the area of his mouth and it was quite a remarkable performance by Mr Joyce. And similarly your Honour, nurse Karen Martin who was first on the scene. From the statements of other witnesses and her own statement, it just appeared was amazingly competent and quick in her response. And I just thought it appropriate to make those comments and leave those with your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes thank you for reminding me of that Mr Crown. Just on the victim’s impact statement is that-- 
       
       
      LOUKAS: Yes well your Honour, of course in terms of the law it is inappropriate for a victim impact statement to be tendered at this stage of the proceedings. I mean victim impact statement is post conviction. Now your Honour of course I was only handed the document this morning, just before your Honour came on the bench and I have not had an opportunity to take instructions from my client. I know that of course my client is very much concerned about the position of Mr Mackellin’s wife and family and discussed with me if he could write a letter expressing his remorse and unhappiness at what had occurred. But in the circumstances, an actual victim impact statement your Honour, legally it is inappropriate to be tendered. And again, I have not even had-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No. 
       
       
      LOUKAS: --an appropriate opportunity to take instructions. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I have no doubt Mr Crown and Miss Loukas, just having read the papers in this matter and in particular the statement of Mrs Mackellin of the agony that she has gone through and her children, and Mr Mackellin’s children have each gone through, because as I say, the impression that comes through the papers, and there are many people who speak of him, is of a decent and gentle man. I think I read nurse after nurse who was familiar with him, saying exactly that and such a loss is tragic and one can only imagine the anguish that they have experienced. I do not, probably in the circumstances, do not really need to say more than that, or to take, to see the document to appreciate it. But my heartfelt sorrow and condolences are extended to the family, indeed both families for what is, on any view, a tragedy, a human tragedy for many individuals. But so far as the staff members of the hospital are concerned, indeed I had meant to incorporate into my judgment, and I am grateful for having been reminded, that the efforts of the staff of the clinic can only be described as heroic and in particular the efforts of nurse Mark Joyce and nurse Karen Martin. And I am sure a transcript will be taken out of these remarks and I will ensure in any event that a letter is sent to the hospital drawing attention to the fact that what they did was indeed heroic and selfless. Is there anything further? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: No thank you-- 
       
       
      LOUKAS: No your Honour I do not think there are any further matters. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Well it remains only for me to thank both counsel for the very considerable assistance you have given me throughout this trial. Mr Southon, you might now go with the officers if you would. 
       
       
      ACCUSED: Thank you.

      O’SULLIVAN v THE QUEEN 
     The appellant was convicted in 1992 in the Local Court on charges of supplying a prohibited drug and self administering a prohibited drug. The only evidence on which the convictions were based was the appellant's confession. 
      
       
     The appellant pleaded guilty to the charges in the Local Court and then lodged an all grounds appeal. In the District Court he ultimately abandoned his appeal against conviction and proceeded only against the severity of his sentence. Judge McGuire confirmed the convictions but set aside the sentences and re-sentenced the appellant. 
      
       
     In July 2001 the appellant filed an application under ss474D and 474E of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 474D(1) enables a convicted person to apply to the Supreme Court for an inquiry into his conviction or sentence. The matter was referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal in order to address fresh evidence which arose from the Police Royal Commission. 
      
       
     The integrity of the two police officers who arrested and charged the appellant was challenged in the Police Royal Commission. One of the officers was later convicted of inciting, soliciting and procuring the supply of prohibited drugs and knowingly giving false evidence. The appellant claimed that he had been coerced by the officers into making a confession, and his conviction depended upon the acceptance of that confession. 
      
       
     The appellant argued that his conviction on each charge resulted in a miscarriage of justice. He claimed that he had only pleaded guilty after determining that the confession, although given under threat, could not effectively be challenged. The pleas of guilty were made in the hope of receiving a reduced sentence. The basis of the appellant's argument was that on the balance of probabilities the alleged confession leading to the convictions was so tainted that there was a significant possibility that an innocent person had been convicted. 
      
       
     HELD (per Sheller JA, Grove and Simpson JJ concurring): 
      
       
     1. The fact that the appellant pleaded guilty to the charges was a matter of significance: see R v Boyd [2000] NSWCCA 110. If the appellant had not pleaded guilty partly, if not wholly, through a consciousness of guilt, then the Court will entertain an appeal against a conviction, notwithstanding the plea of guilty: R v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120. 
      
       
     2. A legal practitioner advising the accused is bound to emphasise that the accused must not plead guilty unless he has committed the acts constituting the offence charged. Having considered the advice, the accused must have a complete freedom of choice whether to plead guilty or not guilty. The judge or magistrate should never tell the accused that on a plea of guilty he or she would impose one sentence but on a conviction following a plea of not guilty a more severe sentence would be imposed. This can place undue pressure on the accused, thus depriving him of that complete freedom of choice which is essential. 
      
       
     3. This case can be distinguished from R v Boyd on two bases. First, because the evidence from the Police Royal Commission was fresh evidence not available to the appellant at trial and second, because the confession was not unequivocal and was given under threat. 
      
       
     4. The test for determining an appeal where a guilty plea had previously been entered is whether the circumstances reveal a miscarriage of justice. The appellant bears the onus of showing the existence of that miscarriage: Davies (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported); Cincotta (Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 November 1995, unreported). 
      
       
     5. The plea of guilty was induced not by a consciousness of guilt but by a recognition that the confession, although given under threat, could not effectively be challenged and that conviction was inevitable. 
      
       
     6. The evidence disclosed that at least one of the arresting police officers was prepared to act corruptly in the performance of his duties in criminal investigations. Thus, the Court could not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was given voluntarily. The appeal was upheld, the convictions on each charge quashed and a verdict of acquittal on each charge entered. 
      
       
     Per Grove J: 
      
       
     7. A basic requirement of the criminal justice system is that no one is to be convicted except for specific offence. The law does not permit conviction by deduction that a person must have committed an offence of category, some time and/or somewhere.

     1 SHELLER JA:  
      
       
        
       Introduction  
        
        
       This appeal comes to the Court on a reference from the Supreme Court pursuant to s474E(1)(b) of the  
       Crimes  
       Act 1900 and has been generated by evidence given in the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service (the Police Royal Commission) in November 1995 and January 1996. Pursuant to that reference the appellant, Michael John O’Sullivan, appeals against his conviction on 5 June 1992 before Judge McGuire in the District Court on charges of supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) (s25(1) of the  
       Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 
        1985) on 14 November 1991 and self administering a prohibited drug (heroin) (s12(1) of the  
       Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       ) on the same date. Each charge was before the District Court on the appellant’s all grounds appeal against his conviction in the Local Court by Mr Butler LCM on 17 January 1992.  
        
       
     2 When the appeal was called on for hearing in the District Court the appellant, who had pleaded guilty to both charges in the Local Court, abandoned his appeal against conviction and proceeded only against the severity of his sentence. Judge McGuire confirmed the convictions but set aside the sentences and re-sentenced the appellant on the first charge to a sentence deferred on condition that the appellant entered into a recognizance for a period of two years in the sum of $1,000 and in respect of the second charge to imprisonment of ten months by way of periodic detention. The deferred sentence was presumably in substitution for that imposed by the Magistrate of six months imprisonment. The appellant has served the sentences imposed. 
      
       
        
       Referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal 
        
       
     3 On 4 July 2001 the appellant filed an application under ss474D and 474E of the Crimes Act. Section 474D(1) enables a convicted person to apply to the Supreme Court for an inquiry into his conviction or sentence. Section 474E provides, so far as presently material: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) After considering an application under section 474D or on its own motion: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a prescribed person into the conviction or sentence, or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.” 
         
        
       
     4 The appellant’s application came before Hulme J, who was satisfied that there was a doubt or question as to the appellant’s guilt and that it was appropriate to refer the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. His Honour referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal the following convictions and sentences imposed upon the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         Those made and imposed by Mr Butler LCM on 17 January 1992 in respect of [the two charges and]… those made and imposed by Judge McGuire on 5 June 1992 in respect of [those] charges. 
         
        
       
     5 In the course of his reasons for judgment Hulme J noted that by letter of 10 August 2001 the Crown Solicitor had indicated that the Attorney-General supported the application that the relevant convictions be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
      
       
        
       Appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal 
        
       
     6 Before this Court the appeal is to be dealt with in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and that Act applies accordingly; s474L. In Johns (1999) 110 A Crim R 149, Greg James J, with whose judgment Dunford J and Smart AJ agreed, explained the historical emergence of and the Court’s practice in dealing with the statutory power to review convictions and sentences now found in the form of ss474D and 474E.  
      
       
     7 Greg James J referred to Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259. At 311 Toohey and Gaudron JJ considered the function which was imposed upon the Court of Criminal Appeal by the Attorney-General’s reference of the “whole case” as against the appellant. Their Honours said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Prima facie, the reference of the whole case required the Court of Criminal Appeal to consider the case in its entirety, subject only to the limitation that it ‘be heard and determined ….as in the case of an appeal by a person convicted.’ That limitation necessitates that the matter be determined by ‘legal principles appropriate to an appeal’:  
         Ratten 
          (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 514, per Barwick CJ. See also  
         R v Gunn [No 1]  
         (1942) 43 SR (NSW) 23 at 25, per Jordan CJ and  
         Allen, Allen & Winter 
          (1910) 5 Crim Appeal R at 225 at 226. 
         
        
        
         
         It has been held that, where the whole case is referred, the court may consider matters not relied upon in the petition ( 
         R v Gunn [No 2]  
          (1942) 43 SR (NSW) 27 at 31) and matters not specified in the reference ( 
         R v Chard 
          [1984] AC 279). On the other hand, it has been said that, as a matter of practice, the considerations may be confined to those in the petition or the reference: see  
         Re Mathews and Ford  
         [1973] VR 199 at 201;  
         R v Chard 
          at 292-3. And in  
         R v Gunn (No 2)  
         at 29 Jordan CJ stated: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘In a case in which there has already been an appeal which has been disposed of on the merits ….the court, in the case of a reference such as the present, is not called upon to re-adjudicate upon any ground of appeal which has been already heard and disposed of, unless some new matter has come to light which makes a reconsideration of the ground necessary or desirable.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         The words of s21(a) of the Code, so far as they require ‘the whole case…..[to] be heard and determined’, permit of only one meaning. It is the whole case which must be passed upon by the application of legal principles appropriate to criminal appeals. That being so, the power to exclude matters from consideration is properly to be seen as an aspect of the inherent power of a court to control its own proceedings.” 
         
        
       
     8 In this appeal it is significant that the appellant pleaded guilty to the charges both in the Local Court and in the District Court and was sentenced on that basis. In R v Boyd [2000] NSWCCA 110 Powell JA, who gave the judgment with which Hulme and Dowd JJ agreed, referred to R v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 where Kirby P, with whom Grove and Newman JJ agreed, said at 121-2: 
      
       
        
         
         “This court has power to set aside a conviction recorded following a plea of guilty: see  
         Forde 
          [1923] 2 KB 400 at 403;  
         Gower v Ross 
          [1959] SASR 278;  
         Stewart 
          [1960] VR 106;  
         Foley 
          (1963) 80 WN (NSW) 726. From these and other cases it is clear that a court will entertain an appeal against such a conviction, notwithstanding a guilty plea, if it appears: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) that the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charges or did not intend to admit that he was guilty of them; or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) that the appellant, upon the admitted facts, could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged: see  
         Caruso 
          (1988) 49 SASR 465 at 489. 
         
        
        
         
         For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence: see  
         O’Neill 
          [1979] 2 NSWLR 582;  
         Sagiv 
          (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 81.” 
         
        
        
       The conditions stated in  
       Forde 
        are not exhaustive. 
        
       
     9 In R v Murphy [1965] VR 187, Sholl J referred to the principles stated in R v Forde, which Powell JA summarised, and said at 190-191: 
      
       
        
         
          “Most of the reported cases can, it is true, be fitted into the principles formulated in  
         R v Forde  
         [1923] 2 KB 400 
         .  
         But they should not be regarded as exhaustive of all possible cases of miscarriage of justice 
         .  
         They do not cover, for example, a case where an accused person, against whom a prima facie case exists, but who denies and has never admitted his guilt, is induced by threats, eg of a fellow accused, or of a police officer, to plead guilty where otherwise he would have pleaded not guilty. In such a case there would, in my opinion, be a miscarriage of justice, unless perhaps the case against him were overwhelming, and there should be a new trial. 
         
        
        
         
         In the present instance, the applicant’s case is that she pleaded guilty because of considerations irrelevant to the actual question of her guilt or innocence, and that she is in fact not guilty. Mr Neesham, in his admirable address on her behalf, put it that it would be sufficient if the question of her guilt or innocence was an issuable matter. I should be disposed to agree that if she pleaded guilty through a misapprehension of the law, eg a misunderstanding of what she was pleading to, or what constituted the crime charged, or for some other reason which enabled one to say that her plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt, an issuable question of guilt would be sufficient to warrant the ordering of a new trial.” 
         
        
        
       In that case, Sholl J was not satisfied that the appellant had not pleaded guilty partly if not wholly through a consciousness of guilt.  
        
       
     10 In Boyd, Powell JA, after considering the relevant authorities, was not persuaded there had been a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     11 In Davies (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported), Badgery-Parker J said:  
      
       
        
         
         “The test is whether the circumstances revealed a miscarriage of justice…. If the integrity of the plea is bona fide questioned because it appears that the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt, then in my opinion the plea of guilty ought be set aside and a new trial ordered if (but only if, and the onus lies on the appellant) it is clear that there is, in the words of Sholl J, ‘an issuable question of guilt’ – to put it more simply, if there is a real question to be tried …[Ii]f the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction, and to order a new trial.” 
         
        
       
     12 In Cincotta (Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 November 1995, unreported) Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Grove and Allen JJ agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “A person who has pleaded guilty will be permitted to withdraw that plea where it has been shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. The applicant for such permission bears the onus of showing the existence of that miscarriage. It will be shown to exist where, for example, the plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the applicant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty. There must be shown to be some circumstances which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt.” 
         
        
       
     13 In Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 511, Dawson and McHugh JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake, or even the desire to gain a technical advantage.” 
         
        
       
     14 On this appeal the appellant has put before the Court and relies upon fresh evidence. In Mickelberg at 273 Mason CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The final matter concerns the appropriate test to be applied by an appellate court in deciding whether to set aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence. It is established that the proper question is whether the court considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before it at the trial. This test was endorsed by four of the five Justices in  
         Gallagher v The Queen 
          (1986) 160 CLR 392. Deane J and I (at 402) considered that the test was best expressed in those terms.” 
         
        
       
     15 On other occasions the Court has been called upon to consider fresh evidence in the form of transcripts of evidence of witnesses before the Police Royal Commission. Sometimes that evidence directly contradicts or casts doubt upon evidence given at a criminal trial. Sometimes the evidence goes to the credit or credibility of witnesses who gave evidence at the trial. In Vastag (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 May 1997, unreported) Levine J, with whom Studdert J agreed, said at p26: 
      
       
        
         
         “Just as the Court should not be quick to allow an appeal on a ‘fresh evidence’ ground merely because police officers involved in a given trial have been adversely referred to in the Royal Commission, nor, in my opinion, should the Court be quick to dismiss a ‘fresh evidence’ appeal by reason of the absence of coincidence between the adverse references in the Royal Commission and the specific subject matter of the trial under appeal. What can be no more than a guide may be stated thus: material from the Royal Commission should be considered to determine whether it is capable of disclosing conduct or, possibly a reputation therefore, pointing to a preparedness in the officer to act corruptly, at least by dishonesty, in his performance of his duties in criminal investigations. The closer the suggested adverse conduct is in the Royal Commission material to that which is relevant to the particular trial the more persuasive will be the position of an appellant in an appeal of this nature.”  
         
        
       
     16 Meagher JA dissenting described three categories of appeal which might come under the heading ‘Fresh Evidence – Police Royal Commission Material appeal”: (a) the first where the police evidence in the Royal Commission actually involved an admission by police officers concerning the very facts of the case under appeal; (b) where the police evidence does not involve any admissions concerning the facts of the case but does involve admissions of misconduct in other matters; and (c) where there was no question of any admission about anything but that the police officer had been made the subject of adverse cross-examination or adverse reference in the Royal Commission. In the first two categories if the admissions were of any substance or sufficient gravity the appeal should be upheld and a new trial ordered. In the third, the appeal should not be allowed. 
      
       
        
       Evidence in Support of Appeal 
        
       
     17 This appeal is supported by an affidavit by the appellant of 7 February 2002. According to that affidavit the appellant was arrested on 15 November 1991 by two police officers, Eade and McClelland. The police facts sheet shows the informant as McClelland, with the rank of Detective Sergeant, and one of the arresting officers as Eade, with the rank of Detective Sergeant. Under the heading “Full Facts” appears the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “The defendant admitted that he was the person in question and that he had been selling small amounts of heroin over the past three weeks to support his heroin addiction. He was later interviewed at the Gosford Drug Squad and further stated that he had been sacked from his employment as a laundry driver because he went off sick with a sore knee. It was from then he started to sell small deals of heroin. Admitted selling 3 x $50 deal and 1 x $100 deal to friends on the 14/11/91 and last using heroin himself on the same day. When Police searched the premises there was no more heroin left and once a week he would buy about half a gram for $150 and divide it into the small deals.” 
         
        
       
     18 In his affidavit, paras 5-8, the appellant set out conversations that he had with Eade and McClelland during the course of which he was told that unless he wrote a statement he was going to “wear some heroin”. At one point Eade threw a bag on the kitchen table in front of him and said: “That is 10 grams of heroin. You’re going to wear it if you don’t write a statement.” Later when asked by the appellant what he had to write on the statement Eade replied, “You’ve got to write that you sold 2 $50 foils and a $100”. The appellant was told he could write it any way he wanted to as long as he put in the two 50’s and 100. The appellant wrote the following statement: 
      
       
        
         
          “At lunchtime today I was visited by the police and questioned by them. I was asked if my name was Michael I said yes. They asked if I was selling smack. I told them that I sold sum [sic] to a friend, 3-50s and a 100 to another friend yesterday 
         
        
        
         
         Normally I buy ½ a gram for $150.00 and sell some, and use the rest for myself. But this only happens about once a week for about 3 weeks

         Detective Sergeant 
         
        
        
         
         Q.1 When was the last time you used heroin? 
          
         A. Yesterday 
          
         Q.2 When you say in your statement 3-50’s and a 100. What are you referring to? 
          
         A. the size 
          
         Q.3 Have you read this statement? 
          
         A. Yes 
          
         Q.4 Have you made this statement of your own free will? 
          
         A. Yes 
          
         Q.5 Has any inducement, threat or promise been held out to you to make this statement? 
          
         A. No 
         
        
        
         
         Witness:……………. Signature: (Sgd) M. O’Sullivan” 
         
        
       
     19 The evidence against the appellant on both charges was the confession. The appellant’s conviction depended on an acceptance of this confession. The appellant told the Police Royal Commission that he only made the signed statement because of the threats made repeatedly to him by the police officers who had arrested him.  
      
       
     20 The appellant annexed transcript of the evidence he gave before the Police Royal Commission on 22 January 1996 in which he recounted the events leading up to and the circumstances in which the confession was made.  
      
       
        
         
         “A. Two people, a lady and a man, walked down, coloured T-shirts and shorts on, walked down past me – I was working on my car so I didn’t take any notice – walked in the house and then later came back out and said who she was and said come inside. I then came inside. By then they were raiding the house – had about six or eight detectives there. I sat down, they took Valerie [his wife] upstairs. 
         
        
        
         
         COMMISSIONER: Q. Before we go any further I want to understand the situation. These two people you said came down past you wearing T-shirts, one of them came and spoke to you? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I think that person had been inside the house, did you say, before that? A. Yes, she came back out and asked me to come back into the house. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she introduce herself at that point and say A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did she say to you? A. Just, ‘Come inside.’ 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t know whether at that stage she was police or not? A. Oh, I knew. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You knew she was police? A. By then I did, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did you know that? A. She looked like a copper. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You said you went into the house and she and this other person were there along with a lot of other police? A. Yes, they all came in. As soon as them two walked in, then just police came from everywhere. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I want to get back to see how this happened. You said you were working on your car and these two people came past? A. Yes. I didn’t take any notice of them. I had me head down in the engine of the car. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say they were accompanied by other police when they came down past you? A. No, they came by themselves and then the woman came back out and said, ‘Come inside’, and I looked up and then there was other detectives coming down and then we walked in. 
         
        
        
         
         COMMISSIONER: Thank you. All right. 
         
        
        
         
         MS BELL: Q. Once you walked inside your house what happened? A. I was told to sit down. I sat down while they searched the house. They found a few grams of hashish; that was all they could find. 
         
        
        
         
         …. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. All right. Did you remain in this area of the living room where you say there was the table and the few grams of hash? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What happened? A. Well, they just kept looking around, they searched around me, around the lounge room area. When they couldn’t find anything a Detective McClelland asked me to go into the kitchen with him, because at that time Val had gone upstairs – was taken upstairs by Detective Eade and Wendy had came downstairs. I went into the kitchen. He started asking me questions about drug dealing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. This is Detective McClelland? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What sort of questions was he asking you? A. Just saying, ‘You’re dealing a lot of heroin up here.’ I said I wasn’t. I said, ‘All we do is a bit of smoko’ and he said ‘I’ve heard otherwise, that you’re doing heaps’, and I just denied it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. By the way, if I could just stop you there for a moment: What factually was the position? Were you dealing in heroin at that time? A. I was scoring for myself and two other people at the time. I wasn’t actually going around selling. I was just getting people’s money, we were going down to Sydney and getting on, just coming back and splitting it, selling maybe one foil or two foils out of it. But mainly it was just me and me mate. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were part of a small group? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You purchased heroin jointly? A. Yes, and then we split it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. For the needs of yourself and your friends? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You might be the one who travelled to Sydney to pick it up? A. No, we all went down. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You might sell some in excess of the amount that you purchased in Sydney? A. I’d sell, if anything, I’d sell 50 out of it, but most of it would be for myself, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you say, ‘I’d sell 50’, you’re talking of a $50 deal? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now if I could take you back to your conversation in the kitchen with Detective Sergeant McClelland on the day of your arrest, you say that Detective Sergeant McClelland put to you that he had information that you were dealing in a quite substantial way in heroin? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You denied that, did you? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you tell him you were dealing at all in it? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What happened next? A. He kept on asking – saying – what did he say? He just put it to me that I’d be arrested if I didn’t admit to it. Then he called Detective Eade. Detective Eade came down and said if you didn’t ‘write a statement you’re going to wear some heroin’ and I said, ‘I’m not writing a statement’ and Detective Eade then pulled out, out of his right-hand pocket, what he said was 10 grams of heroin, it looked to me like about half an ounce, threw it on the table and said, ‘You’re going to wear it if you don’t write a statement.’ He then sent me back out into the lounge room to think about it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Just directing your attention to this object that Detective Sergeant Eade produced from his right-hand pocket, what was it wrapped in? A. It was in sealable lunch bag. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Could you see through the sealable bag to its contents? A. Yes, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It appeared to you to be heroin? A. Yes, white powder. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say that Detective Eade told you that it was 10 ounces? A. Yes. 10 grams, sorry. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Sorry, 10 grams? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And to your mind it looked as though it were half an ounce? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You considered yourself capable of distinguishing -- A. Oh, yes, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. – a packet with 10 grams from a packet with half an ounce?  
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were told to think about it and told to go out into the lounge room? A. Yeah, ‘Sit back down’. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What happened then? A. They then continued to search the house. Then when they’d finished, when they couldn’t find anything, they all just packed up, brought Val back down, said they were taking Val and they told Val that they were taking me, and Val looked and said, ‘Why are you taking Michael for?’ and Detective Eade said, ‘He knows what we’re doing, what it’s all about.’ And I was placed in one car and Val was placed in another car and we were taken down to be charged. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. To which police station? A. Gosford. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say that the police found nothing in your home that day apart from the few grams of hashish? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have any heroin on you at all? A. Yes, it was in me sock. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How much heroin did you have on you? A. I had about $100 foil. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was that discovered by the police at any time that day? A. No, I was never searched. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What happened when you got to Gosford police station? A. I went upstairs with three detectives, Detective McClelland and Detective Eade and some other detective. We walked up, went into a room. I said, just to see what was going on, I said, ‘Well, what can be done about this?’ and they said, ‘What information have you got in’ and they said, ‘We want you to load someone up, personally load them up.’ I said, ‘Yeah, no thanks, I’ll take me chances.’ Detective Eade then left and he was talking to Valerie at the time and this other detective, I don’t know his name, said, ‘Are you going to write a statement?’ I said, ‘No, I’m not going to write a statement’. Then Detective Eade came back into the room, shut the door, then pulled out the half ounce again and said, ‘I’m only doing this once more. If you don’t write a statement now you’ll be charged with the 10 weights.’ I then asked him what I had to write on the statement and he said, ‘You’ve got to write you sold two $50 foils and 100, I think it was, or something like that. I said, ‘Can I write it, I want to write it’. He…….. and then he went back out. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At the time when Detective Eade then produced this package with the white powder, that is in the interview room at Gosford police station, who else was present in the room? A. Detective McClelland and one other detective I don’t know of. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You agreed to write out a statement whilst you were in the interview room at the police station? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         …. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you see before you a copy of the statement that you prepared at the police station on the day of your arrest? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say that before making that statement you asked Detective Sergeant Eade what you should include in the statement and he gave you, as it were, an outline? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you suggest that he dictated this statement or did you use your own words in formulating the statement? A. No, he just said I had to put the three 50s and the 100 in the statement; I could write the statement any way I wanted. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. All right. Do you agree that at the bottom of the statement there are some typed questions and answers and included amongst those is a question: 
         
        
        
         
          Has any inducement, threat or promise been held out to you to make this statement?  
         
        
        
         
         And you answered, ‘No, no’? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who was present in the room when you answered no to that question? A. The three detectives. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What led you to make the statement? A. The half ounce. I didn’t want to spend five years in gaol, which I would have spent. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Once you had made out that statement what happened? A. I was charged. Oh, no, first Detective Eade found 1200 upstairs in one of my closet drawers. He then found that. He said if I made the statement I’d get the money back. When I made the statement he came back and said, ‘I keep my deals’ and pulled the money out in an envelope and handed it to me and I was charged. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was the full sum of $1200 in the envelope? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where did you say that cash had been secreted in the home? A. Up in the wardrobe in one of the drawers, in the sock drawer. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did that money represent? A. Sorry. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did that money represent – where did you get it from? A. That was my money for the drugs. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were any questions asked of you about where you got that money from? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When did you first learn that the police had found the money in the course of their search? A. Downstairs in the kitchen. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did you come to learn that they’d found it? A. Detective Eade said he’d found it. 
         
        
        
         
         A. Did he show it to you then? A. No, I don’t think so. I don’t remember. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he say how much money he’d found? A. No, not that I know of. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But in any event the money that Detective Sergeant Eade handed to you in the envelope at the Gosford police station represented the full amount of money that you had had stored in the sock drawer? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. About how long were you at the police station before you made that handwritten statement? A. About half an hour. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Then after you had made it, Detective Eade handed you back your money. Were you then charged? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And were you released on bail? A. Yeah, taken downstairs, that was the other part; I was worried – I had a lot of fines – and I wouldn’t get out on the fines and he said, ‘No, no worries, just go downstairs be charged and let straight out’ and I went down and I was given seven days on the fines and let out. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What about your wife? A. Yeah, I met her downstairs; she got processed before me. That’s when I told her what had happened downstairs. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you say – A. Then she left. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you said you told her what had happened, what did you tell her? A. I said, ‘They tried to load me and got me to write a statement saying I was dealing’. ” 
         
        
        
       
     21 The appellant went on in his evidence before the Police Royal Commission to deal with the manner in which the charges subsequently came before the Local Court at Gosford where he was sentenced on 17 January 1992 to six months imprisonment. He gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You pleaded guilty before the magistrate? A. I didn’t want to, but the Legal Aid solicitor was supposed to say that I wasn’t dealing, that I was just scoring for friends and she just didn’t say a word and just sent me down the river and told me not to say a word, otherwise I wouldn’t get out on bail. So I didn’t say a word, I didn’t say much and I didn’t get bail either, so it didn’t matter. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You lodged an appeal against your conviction? A. Yes. The magistrate, though, said in front of everyone he didn’t care how the police tricked me into signing a statement, he said I was a drug dealer and that was it and sentenced me, or words to that effect. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you say that the magistrate said that he didn’t care how you’d been tricked into signing the statement, you say he actually said words to that effect in the open court? A. Yes, he just said I was a drug dealer, that was it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you remember what led to the magistrate saying words to that effect? A. Because I was saying that the statement was false and he said, ‘Well, we’ll get the police in to verify it’ and I said, ‘That’s no use’ and he just rambled on and said that and then I was sentenced, I was out of the place. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you remember saying those things about the statement to the magistrate on the day that you were sentenced to six months imprisonment? A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
     22 In his affidavit the appellant said that at the time he formed the view that the evidence of the police would be preferred to his evidence and that he did not have any prospects of successfully defending the charges in the Local Court. He had signed the statement of confession after Eade made threats against him. He had obtained legal advice and formed the view that the signed confession and the corroborated evidence of the police would negate any chance he had of defending the charges. In 1998 he instructed his then solicitor, David Barrow, to obtain a transcript of the proceedings in the Local Court on 17 January 1992. Apparently it has not been possible to locate that transcript. 
      
       
     23 The appellant lodged an all grounds appeal to the District Court pursuant to the former s122 of the Justices Act and applied for bail which was ultimately granted in the Supreme Court. His appeal came for hearing before Judge McGuire on 5 June 1992. He said that Eade was present at the District Court at Gosford on that date when his matter was listed for the appeal hearing. “Mr Eade did not say anything to me at that time but he was staring at me outside the court.” The appellant abandoned his appeal against conviction and proceeded with an appeal against the severity of the sentence only. In his affidavit he deposed: 
      
       
        
         
         “My then solicitor, Mr Bruce Brown advised me, that I didn’t have any chance of succeeding in the appeal against the conviction. He said that the Judge hearing the appeal would not accept my version of events because the police officers would give evidence disputing my version of the events surrounding my arrest and charging.” 
         
        
       
     24 According to the transcript of 5 June 1992 in Gosford District Court the appellant gave the following evidence:’ 
      
       
        
         
         “B [Mr Brown, solicitor appearing for the appellant] Now you admitted to the police that you obtained heroin which you had shared with friends upon their approach to you?  
         
        
        
         
         MO [Michael O’Sullivan] Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         B Just to be clear about the facts in that so there’s no confusion. Would you tell his Honour what the circumstances under which you supplied this heroin? 
         
        
        
         
         MO Yes. There was myself and two other friends, we put money together and then we go down to Sydney and buy it. I’d see the person and I’d come out and we’d share it up And that way we were obtaining more heroin at a cheaper price. 
         
        
        
         
         B Were you acting at any time as a purchaser to supply to unknown persons?  
         
        
        
         
         MO No, I wasn’t. 
         
        
        
         
         B You certain of that? 
         
        
        
         
         MO Positive. 
         
        
        
         
         B Alright. Now, you informed the police that this had occurred over a three week period? 
         
        
        
         
         MO Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         B And by the way did the police ever ask you where you got it? 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: I don’t understand that. What? You all went down to Sydney did you, or …? 
         
        
        
         
         MO No. Just me. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: Yeah, just… 
         
        
        
         
         MO Or sometimes two of us would go if I needed a lift. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: When did you last go down to Sydney before the police picked you up? 
         
        
        
         
         MO It would have been a couple of days before. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: Before that? 
         
        
        
         
         MO Yes 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: And before that? 
         
        
        
         
         MO Oh…probably a week before that. I went down altogether about three times. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: Yes Mr Brown. 
         
        
        
         
         B Now, the police found no drugs at the premises?  
         
        
        
         
         MO No they didn’t. 
         
        
        
         
         B But you nonetheless admitted your offence?  
         
        
        
         
         MO Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         B Oh by the way, you pleaded guilty at the Local Court before the Magistrate? 
         
        
        
         
         MO Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         B And the appeal originally was based on, on all (ui) 
         
        
        
         
         MO Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         B And that’s a mistake as you’ve always intended to plead guilty to the matter? 
         
        
        
         
         MO Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         B And your appeal at the first opportunity was asked to be changed the severity? 
         
        
        
         
         MO Yes.” 
         
        
       
     25 There are annexed to the affidavit the notes of the solicitor Mr Bruce Brown which included: “admit that had obtained heroin which had shared with friends upon their approach to me”; “police found no drugs at premises but I’d admitted offence.” 
      
       
     26 Before the Police Royal Commission the appellant gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “MS BELL: Q. Mr O’Sullivan, you appear to have lodged an appeal to the District Court against conviction, not merely the severity of the sentence? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you do that intentionally? A. Yes, I was going to fight it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you change your mind about that? A. Yes. After talking with my solicitor and reading in the paper that these detectives had gotten medals from the Prime Minister or someone, a couple of weeks beforehand we just thought it was a waste of time trying and it would just lead to a bigger sentence. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You gave instructions to plead to -- A. Plead guilty, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. To change your appeal to one of severity only? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You appeared before the Gosford District Court? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what was the outcome of your appeal? A. I was given 10 weeks – 10 months weekend detention, and a two-year bond or something, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. By the time the judge substituted that penalty for that imposed by the magistrate, you had already served some full-time custody? A. A month, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And then you had been released on bail granted by the Supreme Court? A. Yes, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         ……. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you recall giving evidence before the District Court on 5 June 1992 on the hearing of your appeal, Mr O’Sullivan? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Before the District Court on that occasion did you tell the court that it had always been your intention to plead guilty to the matter and, in other words, that the circumstance that your appeal had been marked as an appeal against conviction was an error; was that the account that you told the judge? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But indeed that wasn’t the truth? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The correct situation, you say, is that when you lodged the appeal following your conviction before the magistrate, you had it in mind to appeal against your conviction? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At that stage who was represent you? A. Bruce Brown. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When did you first go to Mr Brown? A. I’m not sure when. Some time after I was out on bail I went to him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had you already lodged your appeal before you went to see Mr Brown? A. No, no, he gave me some dates, but when I went – I lodged me appeal in gaol, though. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. A. Yes, so, yeah, I hadn’t seen him before that, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you lodged the appeal form, you obtained a copy of the document at the gaol itself, did you? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you -- A. Oh, no, downstairs at the courtroom I lodged the appeal. Yes, and then I was taken to gaol, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you completed that form at the court, did you have any legal adviser with you? A. Yes, Legal Aid staff. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is that the solicitor you said had sold you down the river? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now at that time did you go through the form and tick off the fact that you wanted to appeal against conviction? A. I can’t remember now, but I know I always was going to appeal the sentence, yes, the conviction. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And then after you had some discussions with Mr Brown you changed your mind? A. Yes. He said Judge McGuire would not believe me, that I had no chance and he was right.” 
         
        
       
     27 The appellant referred to evidence given on 16 January 1996 by Mr Wolfgang Puntigam to the Police Royal Commission. Amongst other things, Mr Puntigam gave evidence that Eade and another officer, Ison, forced him to write a statement confessing to the supply of hashish. The Police Royal Commission examined a range of alleged misconduct on the part of Eade and other officers within the Gosford Drug Squad. Eade was adversely referred to in a wide range of areas of misconduct, including (a) the theft of money from suspected drug dealers, (b) the fabrication of evidence, (c) the planting of drugs on drug suspects, and (d) perjury. Eade gave evidence to the Police Royal Commission on 24 January 1996. He denied the allegations made by the appellant and others as to his improper and illegal conduct. Eade was convicted on 18 May 2001 on charges of (a) inciting, soliciting and procuring the supply of prohibited drugs (s27 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act) and (b) knowingly giving false testimony (s21 of the Royal Commissions Act 1923). The false testimony charge was Eade’s acceptance of the statement that he had never been engaged in any form of corrupt or illegal conduct. The falsity of this evidence was demonstrated by video and audio tapes of his conduct in August and September 1995 and had nothing to do with his part in the arrest of the appellant. The charge of inciting was also based on an event of September 1995. Eade was sentenced to twenty-two months custodial sentence on these charges.  
      
       
     28 The appellant annexed an extract of evidence given by District Commander Jarratt to the Police Royal Commission on 28 November 1995. He referred to a complaint investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption that Eade and Ison had solicited a $30,000 bribe from an individual in relation to his arrest in connection with drug offences and said that he had allegations concerning Eade coming from all quarters.  
      
       
     29 In an interim report (para 2.59) the Police Royal Commission said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There have been rumours suggestive of corrupt practices by certain police attached to the Gosford Drug Unit, for a number of years. When Assistant Commissioner Jarratt was the District Commander, Gosford, he became aware of persistent rumours of this kind. He reported these to Assistant Commissioner Parsons, and to Superintendent Moeller, the then Commander of the North Region Crime Squad. They were discounted as lacking in substance, in the aftermath of the arrests of those involved in Operation Hurricane. 
         
        
        
         
         In the following years, complaints relating to the conduct of the Drug Unit continued to be made.” 
         
        
       
     30 In Chapter 4 of the Commission’s final report referring to Central Coast Detectives it was said: 
      
       
        
         
         “While there was material supportive of the existence of corrupt relationships and of serious police misconduct, with the exception of one officer, the police concerned denied all wrongdoing. In these circumstances, final resolution will be left to the criminal justice process, and this Report will not elaborate on the matters noted in the First Interim Report.” 
         
        
       
     31 In a letter dated 15 February 1999 from Detective Inspector Champion of the Special Crime and Internal Affairs Command of the New South Wales Police Service to Mr David Barrow, a solicitor with New South Wales Legal Aid, it was said that McClelland had been medically discharged from the police service on 9 July 1999. Detective Inspector Champion was unaware of any criminal charges against him. At the time of his discharge he was not subject to departmental charges though he was mentioned during the Police Royal Commission. No action emanated from those proceedings. There were allegations additional to the Police Royal Commission made about his conduct but no adverse findings were made. 
      
       
     32 The appellant said that given the coerced confession, the circumstances in which he pleaded guilty in the Local Court and subsequently withdrew his all grounds appeal in the District Court, he considered any prospects of further appeal against his convictions hopeless. It was not until adverse evidence was given to the Police Royal Commission against Eade and other former detectives from the Gosford Drug Unit that he gave any thought whatsoever to lodging an appeal. Even then he took the view that the evidence against Eade and other detectives would be “whitewashed” and that nothing would eventuate from the Police Royal Commission. In 1998 he sought legal advise as to whether or not he might be able to appeal and instructed Mr Barrow, to advise him on his rights to appeal. A draft petition to the Minister pursuant to s100G [sic 100B], of the Justices Act was prepared. That was supported by Detective Inspector Champion’s letter which confirmed that Eade had been dismissed from the New South Wales Police Service on 9 January 1996 on the grounds of misconduct. In November 1999 the appellant lodged a petition for review and that was referred to the Local Court where Mr Swanson LCM determined that he did not have jurisdiction to overturn the conviction because of the appellant’s appeal to the District Court in 1992. 
      
       
     33 The appellant gave oral evidence in this Court and was cross-examined by the Crown. The appellant gave the following evidence in chief: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. In your affidavit, and indeed what you said to the Royal Commission was – and I am just paraphrasing now – that Mr Eade had told you to put in this statement that you had sold either two or three 50s, that is $50 deals, and a $100 deal, is that correct? A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Your handwritten statement has a paragraph after that saying, ‘Normally I buy half a gram for $150 and sell some and use the rest for myself but this only happens about once a week for about three weeks.’ Do you remember writing that in your statement? A. I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where did that come from? A. From Mr Eade. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Would you tell their Honours what is the case? Was the whole document dictated to you, that is your statement, or how did the words in the statement come about? A. Mr Eade said I had to write three $50s and a $100 in the statement and I said, ‘Can I write that any way I want?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ I started writing that I sold the three $50s and a $100 to a friend. He said that I had to put in it happened yesterday, I went and got down to there and then he just added that I bought some and used that. 
         
        
        
         
         …. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. …Mr O’Sullivan, you recall giving evidence in the District Court? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         …. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Just to put this in context, you had previously lodged an all grounds appeal, correct? A. Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But according to your affidavit, because of certain legal advice given to you, you withdrew the all grounds appeal and the appeal proceeded on severity only? A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In the District Court you were put into the witness box by your then solicitor, Mr Brown? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He asked you certain questions? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you recall saying this: Mr Brown asked you this question, ‘Just to be clear about the facts, so there is no confusion, would you tell his Honour about the circumstances under which you supplied this heroin?’ You are recorded as responding this way: ‘Yes, there was myself and two other friends, we’d put money together and then we’d go down to Sydney and buy it. I would see the person and I would come out and we would share it up and that way we were obtaining more heroin at a cheaper price.’ Do you remember that question and answer? A. Yes, I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Firstly, when you said, ‘I would see the person and I would come out and we would share it up,’ was that the truth? A. No, we would all go in and share it and pay money out. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you say ‘we would all go in’, what do you mean by that? A. Well, none of us trusted each other and we would all go in and do the business and come out with ours and then we would go home. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Are you able to tell their Honours why you used the words, ‘I would see the person and I would come out’? A. That was just the way I was thinking at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At that time were you mindful of the statement that you had already made that was before the Court when you gave this evidence? A. I am sorry, I don’t understand. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At the time you were giving this evidence were you mindful of the fact that you already had signed a confession? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were aware of that? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That was in your mind? A. Yes, it was. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can I take you towards the bottom of the page, you were asked this question in fact by his Honour Judge Maguire and this was in relation to you having just explained what you did, how you purchased the heroin. His Honour asked you this, ‘I don’t understand that. What, you all went down to Sydney, did you, or? And you answered, ‘No, just me.’ Do you recall that exchange? A. Yes, I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. His Honour then said, ‘Yeah just’ you then said ‘or sometimes two of us would go if I needed a lift.’ Do you recall that exchange? A. Yes, I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, what was the case? Would you all go down or sometimes you would go down, sometimes two would go down? Can you tell their Honours what do you say was the factual position? A. Ninety-five per cent of the time we would all go down together. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the ‘we’ is this the same, the three people? A. The same three people over a long period of time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say to their Honours that was 95 per cent of the time? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What about the other five per cent of the time? A. There would be two of us because one would be working. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you say to their Honours in relation to the two of you that two would go into the premises and you would come out, or would it just be you, or the other? A. No, we would both go in and we would both come out. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Again, are you able to explain to their Honours why it was that you said to his Honour, ‘No, just me or sometimes two of us would go if I needed a lift’? A. Because of the statement I had written. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. By that are you saying to their Honours that you were seeking to make the evidence you were giving in the District Court consistent with the statement you had written? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mr O’Sullivan, you told the Royal Commission in response to a question, ‘Were you a heroin addict as at 15 November 1991?’ your response was, ‘Yes, all my life mostly, yes.’ Do you remember saying that? A. I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. As at November 1991 – I appreciate you said ‘mostly all my life’, but are you able to be a little bit more specific about that? Approximately how many years were you a heroin addict before 1991? A. 1991 I was 25 years a heroin addict. No, sorry, 20 years. 
         
        
        
         
         CONDITIS: Yours Honours, at page 64 at about .6 of the same document, ‘Do you remember being asked this question at the Royal Commission and putting this in context you were asked about what was actually happening in relation to purchasing heroin, do you understand that? A. Yes.’ 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were asked this question at about .5, ‘By the way, if I could just stop you there for a moment, what factually was the position? Were you dealing in heroin at that time?’ Your answer was, ‘I was scoring for myself and two other people at the time. I wasn’t actually going around selling it. I was just getting people’s money, we were going down to Sydney and getting it, just coming back and splitting up heroin, mainly one foil or two foils out of it, but mainly it was just me and me mate.’ Do you remember that response? A. Yes, I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Again, having regard to the confession that you wrote out yourself, you say at the request of Mr Eade, where there is a confession in there that you sold some heroin, right? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In that confession you signed there is a reference to ‘yesterday’ and ‘in the past few weeks’? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         …. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mr O’Sullivan, in relation to the passage I just took you to, that is, the evidence given in the Royal Commission? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You are certainly prepared to voluntarily and freely give the evidence that you are about to give? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you said to the Commission, ‘Selling may be one foil or two foils out of it,’ are you able to say to their Honours when was the last time prior to November 1991 you had sold one foil or two foils out of it, as you told the Commission? A. I was speaking as an addict and I wasn’t talking about yesterday or the day before, I was speaking about the last few years, the last couple of years. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can I just ask you to direct your attention to my question. A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When was the last time prior to November 1991 – and I appreciate you may not be able to give the precise date, but approximately when was the last time prior to that time you had sold any foils at all out of what you had purchased? A. A couple of years ago before that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When did you stop being on the methadone program or, indeed, are you still on it? A. No, I have been clean for six years now. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So, do I take it that until about 1995 or 1996 you were on the methadone program? A. Yes, until 1996. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Lastly this, towards the bottom of that page you were asked this question, ‘You might sell some in excess of the amount that you purchased in Sydney? A. I would sell, if anything I would sell $50 out of it, but most of it would be for myself, yes.’ Again, ‘I would sell, if anything I would sell $50 out of it’ – when you gave that answer to the Commission, when were you referring to? A. To years back. 
         
        
        
         
         SHELLER JA: Q. Years? A. Two years ago. 
         
        
        
         
         CONDITIS: Q. When you say ‘ago’, do you mean prior to November 1991? A. Yes, prior to November 1991. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Lastly this: you said in your affidavit that you say someone from the Legal Aid Commission in 1998 about what could be done about what you say was the injustice caused to you, correct? A. Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You gave evidence in the Commission in 1996, correct? A. Correct, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why was it that it was not until 1998 that you sought legal advice about what you could do about your position? A. After the Royal Commission I left and I never heard from anyone again. No one told me I could appeal and it was not until 1998 I read it in the paper that others from the Royal Commission were appealing and it mentioned Legal Aid in the paper, so I rang them and started from there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Prior to giving evidence at the Royal Commission you had obviously spoken to investigators from the Commission? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That was about what you could tell them or what you could tell the Commission? A. Yes, what I could tell the Commission. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was there ever any discussion about your rights, as they may have been, about what you could do about your position, with those investigators? A. None whatsoever.” 
         
        
       
     34 In cross-examination he was taken through his previous convictions and acknowledged that he had been an addicted heroin user for some twenty years before 1991. He rejected the suggestion that in November 1991 he not only used heroin but gave small amounts from time to time to his friends who were users. Asked about the confession he signed, he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. The police had asked you if you were selling smack, hadn’t they? A. No, they said I was selling smack. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So they suggested it to you? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say in this handwritten statement that you sold some to a friend ‘three $50s and a $100 to another friend yesterday’? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Could it be that what you have written there is in fact correct? A. No. That is what Mr Eade asked me to write, told me to write and if I didn’t write it I would laden with half an ounce. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He said half an ounce? A. He said 10 grams and threw it out and showed me and I looked it; to me it was half an ounce. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So what you are saying is that having half an ounce in his hand he asked you to admit to basically four deals of heroin? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Which would amount to about just over one gram? A. Yes. I think roughly, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Could it be that that is not what happened, that is, he did not threaten you with that half ounce bag? A. He did threaten me. There is no question about that. He threw it on the table in front of me and two other detectives. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In this handwritten statement, of course, you have written, ‘Normally I buy half a gram for $150 and sell some and use the rest for myself.’ Do you see that there? A. Yes, I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Could it be that the reason you wrote that was because in fact it was the truth? A. No, because he also asked me to write, when I was writing it he just added pieces to it as I wrote. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Half a gram would have been $150 worth, wouldn’t it? A. Half a gram? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were certainly using at that stage, weren’t you? A. I never bought half grams in my life. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. If you went down to Sydney with one or more friends, could I suggest that you would not have just bought a $50 deal or a $100 deal? A. No, we bought larger amounts, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that it would be likely that you would buy an amount for $150, which is half a gram? A. No I would not, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, it would not take many friends to put in money to get $150, would it? A. That’s what street addicts might do, yes, but no, I wouldn’t do that. $150 would be a waste of time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you would get larger amounts, is that what you are saying? A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
     35 The appellant said: “I did everything I did to get heroin. Heroin was my life and I would do anything to get it”. Asked if in fact in November 1991 he was selling from time to time, he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “No, because heroin was my life. It was my life and to me I would never sell heroin. Heroin was everything I could have. I could have a pile of money there, it would be of no use to me. If I had a pile of heroin there, that’s all I ever needed. To give it away, to sell it, was sacrilegious.” 
         
        
        
       He said: 
        
        
         
         “You have got to understand, if you are desperate and you have got $150 left of heroin, you will use that heroin and then rob a house or whatever, you will not sell that heroin and then go and get some somewhere else.” 
         
        
        
       The following interchange took place: 
        
        
         
         “Q. Can I suggest to you that a common way for a heroin user to fund their habit is to sell small portions of their heroin? A. No, if you look in the prison system, they are all thieves, 90 per cent of them are thieves, in there for stealing. A heroin addict finds it very hard to sell because he uses too much. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Your contention is that you wrote that document, MO2, [his handwritten confession] because the police threatened you? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Just to make it clear, could it have been you wrote that document out because it was a fairly accurate picture of what you were doing at the time? A. No, if I wrote out what I was actually doing it would not have been selling heroin.” 
         
        
       
     36 It was suggested to the appellant that he pleaded guilty on both occasions he went before the Local Court which he denied. The questioning continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I suggest you are not telling the truth about that? A. I got up in that court room. My solicitor pleaded me guilty. I said, ‘No, I am not guilty of them charges.’ I don’t remember the exact words. The Magistrate said, ‘Well, get the – no, he said – I said the statement was they were lies. He said, ‘I don’t care how they got you to write the statement. You are a drug dealer,’ and also he said, ‘Bring in the detectives.’ I said, ‘That’s of no use,’ and I grumbled away and stood there and knew then that I had no chance in fighting with Magistrate Butler, so then I pleaded guilty and I was sentenced knowing that I was going to appeal. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. On 2 December 1991, the first occasion which you were at the Local Court, can I suggest to you you pleaded guilty? A. I don’t really remember that one. I only remember the one on the 17th, sorry.” 
         
        
        
       He said that he pleaded guilty to the charges in the Local Court only because he had no choice in the matter. 
        
       
     37 The appellant said that he could not tell the truth to the Judge in the District Court. The following interchange took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Do you say you lied to the District Court Judge? A. I was told to. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who told you to lie? A. I was told that the truth wouldn’t stand up against the police, that the New South Wales Police he would believe at all times. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Are you suggesting your solicitor told you to lie? A. He told me I had a choice and that is the choice I had to take. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You saw it was to your advantage to give this information to the Court? A. No, it wasn’t to my advantage at all. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The purpose of what you had done was so the Judge could understand the size of your criminal behaviour? A. The only reason that was ever told was so I could get out of the hole Detective Eade and his fellow detectives put me in.” 
         
        
       
     38 The visits to Sydney he explained as ones made by himself and either one or two others together each purchasing and being supplied with a separate packet by the dealer. He reiterated that he pleaded guilty in the District Court for the one reason that the Judge would not believe him over the police. 
      
       
        
       Submissions on appeal 
        
       
     39 Submissions have been filed to support the appellant’s claim that his convictions resulted in a miscarriage of justice and for an order that the time for appealing be extended. The nub of the argument is that on the balance of probabilities the alleged confession of the appellant leading to his convictions was so tainted that there was a significant possibility that an innocent person had been convicted.  
      
       
     40 The appellant stressed that his confession was the only basis for his conviction. There was no direct evidence of either of the offences charged. He intended to plead not guilty in the Local Court. He did so and sought to explain that he was forced to sign a confession and that the confession was false. In response the Magistrate said to him, “Alright we will get the police in to verify it” or words to that effect. He got the impression that the police evidence would be preferred to his uncorroborated evidence and he could not succeed at a hearing even if he gave evidence of the threats and forced confession. He was overborne by the threats of Eade. 
      
       
     41 The appellant submits that the material from the Police Royal Commission should be admitted as fresh evidence and that his evidence about the confession should be accepted. If so, it fell within the category of evidence “bought at a price which is unacceptable, having regard to contemporary community standards” R v Pavic (1998) 151 ALR 98 at 121. R v Fernando (Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 April 1999, unreported). 
      
       
     42 The appellant was an impressive witness. Having heard his evidence I accept that he signed the statement of confession because of the threat made to him by Eade. I do this with more confidence because the Crown called neither Eade nor McClellan. I accept that in November 1991 all the heroin that he bought he used himself. Thereafter I accept that he wished to protest his innocence in the Local Court and in the District Court but was frustrated in that endeavour by indications given to him in the Local Court that such protests would be useless and in the District Court by advice from his solicitor that the judge would accept the police evidence.  
      
       
     43 A legal practitioner advising the accused is bound to emphasise that the accused must not plead guilty unless he has committed the acts constituting the offence charged. Having considered the advice the accused must have a complete freedom of choice whether to plead guilty or not guilty. The judge or magistrate should never tell the accused that on a plea of guilty he or she would impose one sentence but that on a conviction following a plea of not guilty he or she would impose a more severe sentence. This can place undue pressure on the accused, thus depriving him of that complete freedom of choice which is essential; see generally R v Turner [1970] 2 QB 321 at 326-7.  
      
       
     44 The present case points out the difficulty in which accused persons found themselves when there was no audio visual recording of interviews. It is appropriate to quote from the joint majority judgment in McKinney v The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 468 at 475-6: 
      
       
        
         
         “The contest established by a challenge to police evidence of confessional statements allegedly made by an accused while in police custody is not one that is evenly balanced. A heavy practical burden is involved in raising a reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness of police evidence of confessional statements, for, in the circumstances which invariably attend that evidence, a reasonable doubt entails that there be a reasonable possibility that police witnesses perjured themselves and conspired to that end. And, as is made clear in  
         Wright v The Queen 
          (1977) 15 ALR at 317 and  
         Carr v The Queen 
          (1988) 165 CLR at 337-338, the contest is one which may entail other forensic constraints or disadvantages. Thus, the jury should be informed that it is comparatively more difficult for an accused person held in police custody without access to legal advice or other means of corroboration to have evidence available to support a challenge to police evidence of confessional statements than it is for such police evidence to be fabricated, and, accordingly, it is necessary that they be instructed, as indicated by Deane J in  
         Carr 
         , that they should give careful consideration as to the dangers involved in convicting an accused person in circumstances where the only (or substantially the only) basis for finding that guilt has been established beyond reasonable doubt is a confessional statement allegedly made whilst in police custody, the making of which is not reliably corroborated. Within the context of this warning it will ordinarily be necessary to emphasize the need for careful scrutiny of the evidence and to direct attention to the fact that police witnesses are often practised witnesses and it is not an easy matter to determine whether a practised witness is telling the truth. And, of course, the trial judge’s duty to ensure that the defence case is fairly and accurately put will require that, within the same context, attention be drawn to those matters which bring the reliability of the confessional evidence into question. Equally, in the context of and as part of the warning, it will be proper for the trial judge to remind the jury, with appropriate comment, that persons who make confessions sometimes repudiate them.” 
         
        
       
     45 The present case can be distinguished from Boyd. First, because the evidence from the Police Royal Commission which was admitted without objection was fresh evidence not available to the appellant at the trial and secondly, because the confession was not unequivocal and was given under threat. The appellant was a heroin addict with a long criminal record. The assessment the appellant and those acting for him made, that his evidence would not be accepted over the police evidence that his confession was voluntary, was a sound assessment. In the context of that time and in the absence of anything to undermine the credit of the police officers who apparently were regarded as exemplary officers, the appellant had no chance of avoiding conviction either in the Local Court or the District Court. This is a sad reflection on the way criminal justice was then administered. The plea of guilty was, I am satisfied, induced not by a consciousness of guilt but by a recognition that the confession although given under threat could not effectively be challenged and that conviction was inevitable. The only hope for the accused was to gain some advantage by having the sentence reduced, it was hoped, to a non-custodial sentence if the appellant pleaded guilty. 
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     46 If at the trial Eade’s reputation and McClelland’s reputation had been known and particularly if it had been known that Eade was a police officer prepared to incite, solicit and procure the supply of prohibited drugs and knowingly to give false testimony on oath there is no possibility that his evidence or that of McClelland as to the writing of the confession would have been accepted. Careful scrutiny of the evidence, as required by McKinney in the passage I have quoted, properly undertaken by the magistrate or judge would inevitably have led to its rejection and the prosecution case on both counts would have collapsed. To adopt the guide suggested by Levine J in Vastag, the evidence discloses that at least one of the police officers was prepared to act corruptly in the performance of his duties in criminal investigations. Taking account of the evidence of the appellant and Mr Puntigam, this Court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the confession was given voluntarily. In my opinion, the appellant’s plea of guilty in the Local Court, or ultimately in the District Court, were not induced by consciousness of guilt and do not stand in the way of this Court intervening. The conviction in the District Court on each charge resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     47 The appellant’s appeal should be upheld, his conviction on each charge quashed and a direction given that a judgment and verdict of acquittal on each charge be entered. 
      
       
     48 GROVE J: I have read in draft form the judgment prepared by Sheller JA. I concur with that judgment and wish to add only a brief observation. His Honour has set out significant transcript extracts of evidence in the earlier proceedings in the Local and District Courts, the Royal Commission and before this Court. The offences charged were, in short, supplying and self administering a prohibited drug. The evidence recites the appellant’s former heroin addiction and there is abundant material which could demonstrate that he had self administered that drug on many occasions and, there is fair evidence which might support a charge of supply if the “deeming” provisions of the statute were applied. 
      
       
     49 It is therefore important in my opinion to emphasize a basic requirement of the system of criminal justice, namely, that no one is to be convicted except for specific offence. The law does not permit conviction by deduction that a person must have committed an offence of category, some time and/or somewhere.  
      
       
     50 It is because of this requirement for precision that care must be taken not to stretch focus beyond the two offences which were evidenced solely by the now discredited “confession”. Once it is shown that that material should be excluded from evidence then there remains none to support the charges and acquittal is demanded. 
      
       
     51 I agree with the orders proposed.52 SIMPSON J: I agree with Sheller JA.

     2 HEYDON JA: This is an appeal against a verdict and judgment given by Sidis DCJ in the sum of $177,586.80 in favour of the plaintiff below against the defendant. The trial took place on 9 May 2001 and judgment was delivered on 10 May 2001. The grounds of appeal are limited to liability.  
      
       
        
       The pleadings 
        
       
     3 The Ordinary Statement of Claim alleged: 
      
       
        
         
         “At all material times the Defendant was responsible for, and had the care, control and management of the basketball courts in the Kane Bruce Memorial Park in Main Road Edgeworth (herein after referred to as ‘the Courts’). 
         
        
        
         
         At or approximately 11.00 am on 28 June 1997 the Plaintiff in the company of three friends entered the Courts for the purpose of playing a friendly game of ‘two on two’ basketball. 
         
        
        
         
         During the course of the same game the Plaintiff stepped backwards on the Courts and his right foot became caught by a nail-rivet in the concrete surface of the Courts and, as a result fell back landing heavily onto both palms.  
         
        
        
         
         The said accident was caused by the negligence of the Defendant, by its servants and agents. 
         
        
        
         
         Particulars of Negligence 
         
        
        
         
         The defendant, by its servants and agents, was negligent in that it, inter alia:- 
         
        
        
         
         (a) Failed to remove the said nail from the concrete Courts on completion of construction of the Courts; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) Failed to carry out proper inspection of the said Courts prior to allowing members of the public to use the Courts; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) Placed the Plaintiff in a position of danger which could have been easily avoided by reasonable care on its part; 
         
        
        
         
         (d) Failed to warn the Plaintiff of the danger of the protruding nail by erecting a barrier or sign indicating the danger; 
         
        
        
         
         (e) Exposed the Plaintiff to risk of injury which could have been avoided by reasonable care on its part; 
         
        
        
         
         (f) Failed to take any, or any adequate care, for the safety of the Plaintiff. 
         
        
        
         
         (g) Failed to properly maintain the Courts; 
         
        
        
         
         (h) Failed to have any, or any proper, regard for the safety of the Plaintiff.” 
         
        
       
     4 The Defence admitted paragraph 2 and put paragraphs 3-6 in issue. 
      
       
     5 At the time of the events in issue the plaintiff was 22. The court in question was an open air court surfaced with smooth cement or concrete. It had been constructed a few months before the accident. It was not strictly speaking a basketball court, but an area corresponding to the goal area of a basketball court in which people could practise basketball, netball and like games, and in which people could play “two on two” basketball of the kind the plaintiff was playing when he was injured.  
      
       
        
       The trial judge’s findings 
        
       
     6 The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         [The plaintiff] said he was defending with his back to the basket and travelling backwards when he felt something against the back of his right boot and he fell backwards. He put his hands out to break his fall. He suffered fractures to both of his wrists as a result of which he was admitted to the John Hunter Hospital. 
         
        
        
         
         He returned to the basketball court one week later and saw a protruding nail which appeared to be rusting. He took photographs of the nail whilst he was at the court. Those photographs are in evidence as exhibits L1 to L5 inclusive. 
         
        
        
         
         The nail was removed by Mr Bull, a carpenter employed by the defendant, in March 1999 after the council had been given notice of the plaintiff’s claim. The nail in question is exhibit 2 in the proceedings.” 
         
        
       
     7 The trial judge then considered certain evidence of Mr Caldwell (the builder of the basketball court), Mr Nolan (the defendant’s principal urban designer) and Mr Bull: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Caldwell said he subcontracted the work of laying the concrete slab. Mr Nolan was the designer and project manager of those works. 
         
        
        
         
         It was said on behalf of the defendant that their evidence was such that I could not be satisfied that the defendant or its builder were responsible for the presence of the nail in the surface of the basketball court. Mr Caldwell said that he did not use nails of the type which is exhibit 2. He said that he had been personally involved with his employees in laying masking tape and painting the line markings on the courts as part of his contract with the council and he had not seen the nail in the position claimed by the plaintiff as confirmed by Mr Bull. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Bull, who pulled out the nail, is a carpenter. He said that the nail is of a type used by concreters for the purpose of holding expansion joints in the course of laying concrete slabs. He said the nail had not been driven fully into the concrete and he removed it easily with a claw hammer. 
         
        
        
         
         Both Mr Caldwell and Mr Nolan said that the slab had been inspected prior to practical completion of Mr Caldwell’s contract. Mr Caldwell said this inspection took place in October 1996. Mr Nolan said the inspection took place in February 1997. There was no record of any final inspection of the slab in Mr Nolan’s diary. He said he did not record inspections of items of the work if there were no defects in those items. This statement is not in fact borne out by his diary, which is exhibit 5B, or the summary contained in exhibit 5A. Those entries record inspections and the progress of works, not always in the context of defects. There is a record of the inspection in February 1997 which is clearly directed at the inspection of landscaping at the site at Edgeworth and another site at Barnsley. The fact that the landscaping was the centre of attention in February 1997 is consistent with the evidence given by Mr Caldwell. Thus there is no record of any final detailed inspection of the slab.  
         
        
        
         
         Having regard to the inconsistencies of the evidence of Mr Caldwell and Mr Bull, and Mr Caldwell and Mr Nolan, I have to approach their evidence with some circumspection. Having said this however, the fact is that the position of the nail as shown in the photographic evidence is such that it was not placed in an expansion joint or a saw cut and there is therefore no explanation as to why the nail should have been in the position shown on the evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         Another relevant factor to be taken into account is that it was known to Mr Caldwell and Mr Nolan that vandalism was rife during the construction period. The vandalism was such that additional reinforcement was necessary for the shelter provided at the facility; the water bubbler that had been provided was damaged so frequently that it was ultimately capped off; the netball posts were removed with such frequency that they were ultimately replaced with a second basketball post. They were aware that the courts and the area around the courts was frequently covered with broken glass and bottles. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff’s evidence was that on the day of his accident and on other days prior to this date when he had played at the courts, the area had been unkempt, the grass had not been mown, there was rubbish and debris including broken glass and bottles on the courts and in the area of the courts. 
         
        
        
         
         The defendant presented no evidence to me of any system of cleaning, maintaining or regulation of the use of the courts or the park.” 
         
        
       
     8 The trial judge then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The council’s case proceeded on what appeared to be a misapprehension that it was necessary for the plaintiff to establish that it, as the defendant, was responsible for the placement of the nail in the course of the construction process. It may well, as submitted, be possible to draw an inference that the nail was left by the concrete subcontractor following the laying of the slab in the course of construction of the courts. 
         
        
        
         
         However, the plaintiff has also pleaded that the defendant had the care, control and management of the basketball courts. It is evident that the courts comprised a facility provided by the defendant and made available for public recreation. As such the defendant has obligations at common law to those members of the public who elect to use that facility. 
         
        
        
         
         The extent of the obligations of public authorities has been dealt with in a number of decisions amongst the most recent of which is the decision of the High Court in  
         Romeo v Conservation Commission of Northern Territory 
          (1998) 72 ALJR 208, notably in the decision of Brennan CJ in which he stated that: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘A public authority charged with management and control of premises upon which the public may enter as a right is given those powers for the purpose inter alia of protecting the person of those who enter. The public authority is obliged to exercise those powers reasonably to fulfil that purpose unless there is some contrary statutory direction.’ 
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
         He did note that in the absence of any special situation a member of the public is not entitled to expect any higher standard of care from the public authority than that which is reasonably required to safeguard the public at large or that section of the public entitled to enter the premises.  
         
        
        
         
         As to the obligations of the occupier of premises to which the public at large are entitled to have access, the Court of Appeal in  
         Drotem Pty Limited v Manning 
         , CA40784/99, 16 November 2000, stated that: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘The occupier of commercial premises to which the public had access owes a duty to those members of the public to take reasonable care to avoid injury to persons using the premises and to have in place a system for the cleaning of those premises for removing rubbish and for the periodic inspection of the premises to establish whether there has been any deterioration in the premises and to take reasonable steps to rectify that deterioration.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         I see no reason to depart from those principles in this case, particularly given the evidence of the defendant’s knowledge of the vandalism and the extent to which the courts had been neglected in terms of regular attention to landscaping and grass cutting and affected by debris, glass and bottles. 
         
        
        
         
         It was put on behalf of the defendant that there was no evidence as to how long the nail had been present on the surface of the basketball court and thus I could not be satisfied that any system of regular maintenance or inspection would have prevented the plaintiff’s accident. This again is not a tenable position for the defendant to have taken, having regard to the many decisions of the Court of Appeal concerning the obligations of occupiers of premises to have some system in place. If there had been a system of regular maintenance adopted by the defendant as far as these courts were concerned, that argument may have assisted it. 
         
        
        
         
         In conclusion, on the facts I am able to draw a reasonable inference that the nail, which is exhibit 2, was on the site of the basketball court as a result of the construction of that court. It was in the position shown on the evidence for some reason during the course of construction or as a result of some positive act of vandalism following completion of construction. The nail was readily detectable. It was easily found by Mr Bull when he was sent to locate it. It is evidence that because of the vandalism and spreading of rubbish around the courts that there was a need for regular attention to the courts. I have come to the conclusion and the finding that if there had been a system of regular inspection then it is probable that this nail would have been located by the defendant and removed.  
         
        
        
         
         The question was also raised as to whether the nail was in fact the cause of the plaintiff’s fall, it being said that the first evidence concerning the presence of the nail was that obtained by the plaintiff when he returned to the basketball court one week after his accident. This submission was based upon the fact that the plaintiff initially stated in his evidence-in-chief that he fell about one metre within the circle drawn on the court but that in cross-examination he stated that he could have fallen one metre either side of that line. The position of the nail appeared on the evidence to be about one metre outside the line marking. 
         
        
        
         
         Having regard to the plaintiff’s evidence that he was moving backwards within the area of the circle and that he felt his right boot come into contact with some object which caused him to fall, I am satisfied that the nail was the most probable cause of the plaintiff’s fall. 
         
        
        
         
         The friends with whom the plaintiff was playing at the time of his fall were not called as witnesses. The plaintiff said he had lost contact with them. I have some doubt as to the use of the term ‘friends’ in relation to these persons since apparently they continued to play basketball after he had had his accident when his left hand was in a dislocated position and he had to make his own arrangements to get himself to hospital. In the circumstances I make no adverse finding concerning the fact that the plaintiff has not called those witnesses.  
         
        
        
         
         On the issue of liability, it is clear therefore that I find for the plaintiff on the basis that the defendant was negligent in its care, control and management of the basketball court and that had it undertaken its obligations of care, control and management to the appropriate standard it is probable that the nail which tripped the plaintiff and caused him to fall would have been located and removed and this would have prevented his accident.” 
         
        
        
        
       The grounds of appeal 
        
       
     9 The grounds of appeal are: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. Her Honour’s findings that the nail was the most probable cause of the Respondent’s fall (judgment 7.3) was wrong. 
         
        
        
         
         2. There was no evidence upon which Her Honour could find objective facts from which to infer, as opposed to speculate upon, the causative potency of the nail. 
         
        
        
         
         3. Her Honour erred in applying a standard of care (judgment 5.4) which was too high in the circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         4. There was no evidence upon which Her Honour could find, in the circumstances of this case, that a failure to inspect the sporting facility amounted to a breach of duty to the Respondent.” 
         
        
       
     10 The oral argument of the appellant in support of these grounds was divisible into three parts. First, it was submitted that the plaintiff had not proved that the nail was on the court at the time of the accident. Secondly, it was submitted that even if it was, and assuming that the plaintiff tripped on it, the plaintiff had not shown that any reasonable system would have detected and removed it. Thirdly, even if the nail was there and even if a reasonable system would have detected and removed it, the plaintiff had not proved that he tripped on it.  
      
       
     11 As Ipp AJA explains, the appellant accepted that if the nail were on the site at the time construction work ended, the defendant was in breach of duty. I agree with Ipp AJA’s reasons for concluding that the nail was there when the construction work ended.  
      
       
     12 The principal outstanding issue thus relates to whether the plaintiff tripped on the nail or tripped for some other reason. That issue arises in relation to Grounds 1 and 2. Some of the argument on this issue was presented in writing and some orally. Another issue was whether the plaintiff took reasonable care for his own safety; it arises in relation to Grounds 3 and 4. Argument on this issue was entirely written.  
      
       
        
       Grounds 1 and 2: causation 
        
       
     13 The defendant’s written submissions state: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Respondent could not, and did not, say that he tripped on or came into contact with the nail. Nor did any other witness say this. 
         
        
        
         
         The Respondent was unaware whether the nail was even present on the day of the accident. No other witness deposed to its presence on the day. 
         
        
        
         
         The Respondent had not seen the nail in prior visits to the court: T5.50-6.10. No other witness deposed to its presence prior to the day of the accident.” 
         
        
       
     14 The “prior visits to the court” numbered “a few times”. He did not play basketball on all these occasions.  
      
       
     15 The defendant’s written submissions continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “The first occasion on which the Respondent saw the nail was about a week after the fall when he returned to the site: T7.22. He did so ‘to find out what it was [he] tripped over’: T7.58. He said that the nail had ‘started rusting’: T7.37. 
         
        
        
         
         The Respondent said he ‘was playing against [his associates] and … was defending against [one associate] … and … stepped back and felt something catch the back of my boot …’. T6.55 
         
        
        
         
         There was therefore no evidence which permitted her Honour to draw an inference that the Respondent tripped on the nail. 
         
        
        
         
         In  
         Jones v Dunkel 
          (1959) 101 CLR 298 Kitto J said (at page 305): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘… I agree that no ground for an inference is to be found in general considerations as to the likelihood of negligent conduct occurring in the condition which existed at the time and place of the collision. One does not pass from the realm of conjecture into the realm of inference until some fact is found which positively suggests, that is to say it provides a reason, special to the case under consideration, for thinking it likely that in that actual case a specific event happened or a specified state of affairs existed.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         In the same case, Dixon CJ said (at page 305) that the balance of probabilities test: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘ … does not authorise a court to choose between guesses, where the possibilities are not unlimited, on the ground that one guess seems more likely than another or the others. The facts proved must form a reasonable basis for a definite conclusion affirmatively drawn of the truth of which the tribunal of fact may reasonably be satisfied.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Both passages were applied by Spigelman CJ in  
         Seltsam Pty Limited v McGuiness 
          (2000) 49 NSWLR 262 at [97] and [168]. 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence was insufficient to permit the Court to  
         infer 
         , as opposed to  
         speculate 
         , as to the object, if any, upon which it was that the Respondent’s heel caught. 
         
        
        
         
         If, contrary to the previous paragraph, her Honour was entitled to draw any inference as to causation, the evidence permitted only a finding that the Respondent fell on broken glass. The Respondent saw broken glass on the court before he was injured: T7.10. 
         
        
        
         
         There were no ‘ 
         positive proved facts from which the inference 
          (that it was the nail rather than some broken glass, or any other hazard)  
         can be made  
         …’ and therefore ‘ …  
         the method of inference fails and what is left is mere speculation or conjecture 
         ’:  
         Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Limited 
          [1940] AC 152 at 169-170 cited by Spigelman CJ in  
         Seltsam 
          at [87].” 
         
        
       
     16 The plaintiff submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is submitted that it was clearly open to the trial judge to find that the respondent tripped upon the nail and the presence of the nail was the cause of [the] respondent’s fall. This finding was open to her Honour based upon the following facts: 
         
        
        
         
         (i) The respondent tripped on something which caused him to fall. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) The respondent returned to the area of his fall shortly after the fall and observed the nail in the ground. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) The nail was rusty and in the circumstances a reasonable inference to be drawn was that the nail had been present in the ground for some time. 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) The nail was in the immediate area where the respondent fell. 
         
        
        
         
         (v) It was never suggested to the respondent that he tripped on anything else other than the nail. 
         
        
        
         
         In the circumstances, it is submitted that her Honour was entitled to find, on the balance of probabilities, that the presence of the nail in the surface of the basketball court was the cause of the respondent’s fall.”  
         
        
       
     17 The defendant presented further arguments orally. It submitted in essence that the nail was only one of three possible causes of the fall, the others being that the plaintiff tripped on broken glass and that the plaintiff tripped over his own feet. It submitted that these three possibilities were of equal probability, so that the nail had not been shown to be the cause of the accident more probably than not.  
      
       
     18 The plaintiff in chief denied that he had tripped over his own feet. In chief and in cross-examination he repeatedly said that he had a sensation of tripping over something which caught in his footwear. As the trial judge found, about a week after the accident the plaintiff revisited the site: he found and photographed a nail protruding above the surface of the court. On 1 March 1999 he and Mr Burn, a consulting engineer, met at the site. The plaintiff pointed out the nail and further photographs were taken. At about that time the plaintiff reported the existence of the nail to the defendant, and Mr Bull was sent there to remove it, which he did. 
      
       
     19 The plaintiff was not cross-examined to suggest that he had no injuries, or that they were not connected with the defendant’s basketball court, or that they were not caused by a fall, or that he had not fallen. He accepted in cross-examination that the nail shown him (Exhibit 2), which Mr Bull extracted from the court nearly two years later, was pretty close in appearance to that which he saw a week after the accident. Hence it is beyond controversy that there was a nail. As Ipp AJA demonstrates, it had been there for months. Mr Bull said it was not difficult to pull out, and he pulled it out with a claw hammer. Photographs taken by both the plaintiff and Mr Bull show the nail protruding above ground level. The plaintiff said that the nail had a flange which was flush with the concrete, leaving the head sticking above the surface of the concrete. Mr Bull said that the nail had a washer on it, no doubt bringing about the same effect. The photographs reveal a feature corresponding with their description.  
      
       
     20 There was some confusion in the plaintiff’s evidence as to where the nail was located, and the photographs he took do not clear it up. But it seems clear from Mr Bull’s evidence and Mr Burns’ evidence that the nail was just outside the shooting circle, in the general vicinity of where the plaintiff said the accident happened. It is understandable that the plaintiff might have had difficulty in identifying or recollecting precisely where he fell in view of the fact that he was moving backwards, excited by the game, until he suffered the sudden pain of his wrist injuries experienced while breaking his fall.  
      
       
     21 Counsel for the defendant suggested in cross-examination that the plaintiff had exaggerated his injuries, but it was never suggested to the plaintiff that he had fallen by tripping over his own feet or that he had fallen on something other than the nail. The only other thing he could have fallen on was broken glass. So far as the defendant suggests that the plaintiff could have fallen on “a bit of broken glass”, to use the plaintiff’s description of what he noticed in the area, that does not correspond with how the plaintiff described what happened, for example: “I’ve stepped back and felt something catch the back of my boot”; “I had a sensation of something catching [my] boot”; “I tripped over it”; “I didn’t see it the first time I tripped over it, caught the back of my boot”; “[I] tripped over something while I was playing, otherwise it wouldn’t have caught the back of my foot”. That style of description is one which the plaintiff is recorded as having used in his accounts of the accident to his expert, Mr Burn, and to medical practitioners. The plaintiff’s language suggests that his foot came into contact with an immovable object like the nail, not a moveable and light object like a piece of broken glass. In cross-examination the plaintiff said that when he went back to the scene of the accident a few days after it had taken place, he “just about tripped over [the nail] again”. Further, in cross-examination the plaintiff said the area on which he played was clean enough to play on, and if it had not been he would not have played there. This points against the presence of broken glass large enough, or with edges jagged enough to catch on the surface, to explain the accident. 
      
       
     22 While the trial judge was not bound to accept the plaintiff’s evidence in chief (repeated as it was several times in cross-examination), even though it was neither contradicted nor cross-examined on, to refuse to have done so would have been an unusual course. The defendant in this respect did not suggest any reason in the circumstances of this case why she should have taken that unusual course. The plaintiff’s evidence that he did not trip over his own feet having been implicitly accepted, no suggestion that he could have tripped over broken glass having been made (that being improbable anyway), and there being no other possible cause of the trip beyond the nail, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that it was more probable than not that the plaintiff had tripped on the nail. She did not rely only on “general considerations as to the likelihood of negligent conduct occurring”. She did not stay in the “realm of conjecture”, but reasoned by a process of inference. There were circumstances special to the case for finding that the nail was the cause, namely that the plaintiff excluded the only other possible causes of the “sensation of something catching” his footwear of which he testified, and he fell in the vicinity of a protruding nail capable of generating that sensation. If the plaintiff had been found dead near the nail and there were no witnesses to what happened, a conclusion that he fell because of having tripped on the nail might be capable of stigmatisation as mere conjecture. But it cannot be mere conjecture to accept positive evidence from which the relevant inference could be drawn. Similarly, the trial judge did not choose between guesses. Once the trial judge accepted that the plaintiff had a sensation of something catching his footwear, there was no need to choose between two possibilities, because there was only one possibility. The plaintiff’s evidence did create a reasonable basis for a definite conclusion that the plaintiff tripped on the nail, and the trial judge’s satisfaction about the correctness of that conclusion was reasonable.  
      
       
        
       Grounds 3-4: standard of care and breach 
        
       
     23 The defendant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Her Honour determined that the standard of care to be expected of a Council with respect to a public facility was the equivalent of that demanded of the occupier of commercial premises to which the public has access: Judgment 5.4. 
         
        
        
         
         In so doing, her Honour imposed a standard of care that was too high in the circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         That the standard of care to be expected of a duty-ower depends very much on the circumstances of the particular case has been acknowledged recently by this Court:  
         David Jones Limited v Bates 
          [2001] NSWCA 233 per Davies AJA at [15]. 
         
        
        
         
         In the present case, the circumstances were that a relatively innocuous playing court did not require the same level of supervision, inspection and care by a public authority as might more high risk facilities such as swimming pools, or children’s playgrounds, or the like. 
         
        
        
         
         Nor was there any evidence of any particular feature or ‘special situation’ of the type referred to by Brennan CJ in  
         Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory 
          (1998) 72 ALJR 208, to which her Honour referred (judgment p4-5), such as would heighten the duty on the Council. 
         
        
        
         
         In

          the Court of Appeal (at [16]) noted that the duty of care will be conditioned on users ‘taking reasonable care for their own safety’. Here the Respondent did not take reasonable care for his own safety in that he did not: 
         
        
        
         
         (i) refuse to play on a court where there was, to his knowledge, broken glass; or 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) remove the broken glass off the court before playing. 
         
        
        
         
         Had the Respondent done the former there would have been no accident; had he done the latter, in all probability he would have discovered the nail if it was there to be seen. He did not do the latter because he regarded it as someone else’s responsibility: T22.42.”  
         
        
       
     24 While in oral argument to this Court the defendant appeared to withdraw any contention that the trial judge applied the wrong standard of care in any way that mattered, let it be assumed, without deciding, that, as the defendant submitted in writing, the trial judge was wrong to apply the test stated in Drotem Pty Ltd v Manning [2000] NSWCA 320 to these facts. There cannot be any quarrel with the test stated by Dixon J in Aiken v Kingborough Corporation (1939) 62 CLR 179 at 210, to which Brennan CJ made favourable reference in Romeo’s case (1998) 192 CLR 431 at [17]. The law does not know any test more favourable to the defendant: 
      
       
        
         
         “What then is the reasonable measure of precaution for the safety of the users of premises, such as a wharf, who come there as of common right? I think the public authority in control of such premises is under an obligation to take reasonable care to prevent injury to such a person through dangers arising from the state or condition of the premises which are not apparent and are not to be avoided by the exercise of ordinary care.” 
         
        
        
       The presence of the nail was, according to the plaintiff, not apparent. He was not cross-examined to suggest that it was apparent. Mr Bull had no trouble finding it, but he knew where to look. Further, one of the purposes of the court was to play “two on two” basketball. The plaintiff was using it for that purpose. That activity is one in which players are often moving backwards and sideways. It is an activity the speed and nature of which are such that even if players are looking forwards, they are concentrating on the ball and the position of other players, not on the condition of the surface. They are not to be compared to pedestrians moving relatively slowly through the streets with the opportunity to keep their eyes on the ground. As Mr Burn, the consulting engineer whose reports were tendered by the plaintiff and admitted without objection, said, the area was “specifically designed for games where the ball has to be handled quickly and accurately and the pedestrian surface must therefore be able to be relied upon without visual reference”. The photographs of this court which were in evidence demonstrate that the surface was smooth apart from the nail, and this must have tended to build up a reasonable expectation that the surface would be wholly smooth. Further, since the court was made of cement or concrete as distinct from wood, users would be unlikely to expect that any nails would be in it at all, let alone nails protruding 5 mm above the surface. The presence in a court of this kind of nail is not something which users would be seeking to detect, and users employing reasonable care would not be likely to have detected the nail. Indeed, as will be seen, the trial judge made a finding, not challenged in terms, that the nail “is a very small nail [and] is not something that would have … exercised the attention of persons playing on the court … .” The court may have seemed, as the defendant submits, “relatively innocuous”, but the existence of the nail called for at least sufficient inspection to detect and remove it. The court, in view of its hard surface, did carry a significant risk of injury to users to the extent that it rendered them likely to fall.  
        
       
     25 Another approach is to apply what Deane J said in Hackshaw v Shaw (1984) 155 CLR 614 at 662-3 as to the modern approach to occupier’s liability cases. In Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna (1987) 162 CLR 479 at 488 the majority approved that approach and said, in words applicable to the present case: “the fact that the respondent was a lawful entrant upon the land of the appellant establishes a relationship between them which of itself suffices to give rise to a duty on the part of the appellant to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to the respondent.”  
      
       
     26 Here there was reasonable foreseeability of a real risk of injury to persons in the position of the plaintiff, and the contrary is not contended. Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48 requires that the estimation of a reasonable man’s response to that risk, which defines the standard of care to be attained, be arrived at by considering various factors. Though there is no evidence that a risk of injury materialised over the two years in which the nail was there except to the plaintiff, there was some probability of its occurrence. Though the risk of serious injury may not have been great, it was real. The plaintiff’s injuries were serious, and they could have been much worse. Alleviating action in the form of detecting the nail by inspection and pulling it out was not shown to be other than cheap and easy. The defendant pointed to no other competing responsibilities. This reasoning suggests that the defendant was in breach of the standard of care created by the duty which it admittedly owed. Indeed in oral argument to this Court the defendant conceded that if the nail were on the site when construction concluded it was in breach of duty, and for the reasons given by Ipp AJA, the nail was on the site at that time.  
      
       
     27 The defendant’s contention that the plaintiff did not take reasonable care for his own safety must be evaluated against the following background.  
      
       
     28 The defendant pleaded contributory negligence in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the alternative, the Defendant says that the Plaintiff’s injury, loss and damage was caused, or materially contributed to, by his own negligence. 
         
        
        
         
         Particulars of contributory negligence 
         
        
        
         
         Failing to keep a proper lookout; 
         
        
        
         
         Failing to inspect the court prior to its use; 
         
        
        
         
         Failing to take reasonable care for his own safety.” 
         
        
       
     29 The trial judge rejected that defence in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “In this matter I am reminded that the defendant raised the issue of contributory negligence in its defence and it is put to me this morning that the basis for the argument is that the nail, according to Mr Bull, was readily visible and ought to have been readily visible to the plaintiff before he started to play on the basketball court. It is apparent that the nail, exhibit 2, is a very small nail. It is not something that would have, I think, exercised the attention of persons playing on the court and it is apparent that it remained in its position at least from June 1997 until March 1999 without detection, except when the plaintiff tripped on it. In those circumstances I make no finding of contributory negligence against the plaintiff.” 
         
        
       
     30 There is no ground of appeal challenging that reasoning. Yet if the argument under consideration was correct, one would have been expected.  
      
       
     31 The argument based on the presence of broken glass is not recorded in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge as having been put. Let that be laid on one side. The argument overlooks the plaintiff’s evidence to the following effect. In chief he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You fell over and we know now the injuries that you sustained. Did you notice anything on the ground in the area where you fell? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Probably a bit of broken glass here and there.” 
         
        
       
     32 In cross-examination the following evidence was given: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And of course, with all this glass and other rubbish that might have been in the area, it’s necessary before you can play two-on-two-type basketball to make sure that you’ve got the glass and debris removed from all around the area, particularly in the circle surrounding the hoop, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yep. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was that the situation that existed at the time that you had your accident? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. Most of the glass was over the other side of the court, it was like two, two keys there, like two basketball hoops. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. And we just used the one closest -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have to clean any debris off the court? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I don’t believe why I should have. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mm? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t and I didn’t think why I should have. Council was supposed to look after it.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. I’m not criticising you, I’m just asking you whether there was any debris when you got there that you had to clean off in the vicinity of the basketball hoop so that you could play the game? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I never cleaned it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t clean it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were other people playing there at the time that you arrived or not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. We more or less got there at the same time on the day of the accident. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had you arranged with your friends to go there? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you arrived there is this the situation that the area in the front of the hoop, which is bounded by the circle, or the half circle, was clean enough for you to play -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, otherwise we wouldn’t have played and it was. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well you would have cleaned it off I take [it] if it wasn’t clean? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Wouldn’t of played there at all.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     33 In short, the plaintiff’s perception was that in the specific area in which the game was played, the surface was clean enough to play on. To the limited extent that any attempt was made to shake the genuineness and reasonableness of that perception, that attempt failed. Failure either to refuse to play the game or to clean the court was thus not evidence of a failure by the plaintiff to take reasonable care for his own safety. 
      
       
        
       Disparity between written and oral submissions 
        
       
     34 I agree with the observations of Ipp AJA about the disparity between the defendant’s written submissions and its oral argument. The present appeal is far from being the only appeal in which a disparity of that kind is evident. In some future case it may be necessary for this Court to take the extreme step of declining to hear oral arguments which are outside the parameters of the written argument unless there has been some good explanation for why the disparity exists.  
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     35 The following orders are proposed: 
      
       
        
       1. The appeal is dismissed. 
        
        
       2. The appellant is to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal. 
        
       
     36 IPP AJA: I have had the benefit of reading the reasons to be published by Heydon JA. I agree with his Honour, but for different reasons, that the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     37 The appellant caused basketball courts for the general use of the public to be constructed in Edgeworth. The courts were under the appellant’s care, control and management. 
      
       
     38 The courts were constructed from September 1996 to February 1997. In October 1996 the concreting was completed. On 12 February 1997 the completed courts were handed over by the contractor to the appellant and on that date the surfaces were inspected on the appellant’s behalf. 
      
       
     39 Some six months later, on 28 June 1997, the respondent was injured when he fell while playing basketball on one of the courts. While moving backwards he tripped over a small nail that had been hammered into the concrete slab of the court and which protruded about 5 millimetres above the surface. 
      
       
     40 The appellant contended that the trial judge had erred in finding that the respondent had tripped over the nail. I agree with Heydon JA, for the reasons given by him, that there was evidence that justified the trial judge’s findings in this respect.  
      
       
     41 Mr Maconachie QC, senior counsel for the appellant, did not dispute that the appellant owed the respondent a duty of care. The duty of care owed by the appellant was to take reasonable care to avoid injury to persons playing basketball on the courts: cf Canterbury Municipal Council v Taylor [2002] NSWCA 24 at [112] to [113].  
      
       
     42 Mr Nolan, who at the relevant time was employed by the appellant as “the senior landscape architect”, said that in February 1997 he carried out a final inspection of the concrete slabs that formed the bases of the courts. Mr Caldwell, the contractor, said that the final inspection of the slabs occurred in October 1996. Sidis DCJ said that she had to regard the evidence of Mr Nolan and Mr Caldwell with circumspection as there were inconsistencies in their evidence. In my view, however, Mr Nolan’s testimony that he inspected the slabs in February 1997 should be regarded as an admission to that effect by the appellant and should be accepted. Mr Machonachie argued the matter on the basis that there had been a final inspection in February 1997.  
      
       
     43 Mr Nolan said that during the final inspection in February 1997 he and Mr Caldwell walked over the site a number of times when inspecting the surface of the concrete slabs. He said that the concrete was then “quite white” and if a nail had been protruding “it would have been relatively obvious”. The inference is that - if the nail was then in the concrete - the inspection was inadequate. 
      
       
     44 Sidis DCJ inferred that the nail was “on the site of the basketball court as a result of the construction of that court”. On the basis that this finding meant only that the nail was brought on to the site while the court was being constructed, and for some reason connected with its construction, it was not challenged. The appeal proceeded on the basis that this finding did not mean that the nail was inserted in the concrete “as a result of” or during the construction of the court. These were matters in dispute.  
      
       
     45 Sidis DCJ found that the nail had been inserted in the concrete “for some reason during the course of construction or as a result of some positive act of vandalism following completion of construction”. That is to say, she found that there were only two possible ways in which the nail came to be inserted in the concrete. One was by some person during the course of construction of the court. The other was by a third party after the construction had been completed (presumably on the basis that the third party in question had found the nail lying on the site).  
      
       
     46 Sidis DCJ did not decide which of the two ways in question was the more probable. In her Honour’s view, that was not material. She found that had the appellant implemented a reasonable system of maintenance and inspection it would have detected the nail before the respondent was injured. She held that the appellant was negligent in failing to have such a system in place.  
      
       
     47 Mr Maconachie contended that Sidis DCJ erred in finding that a reasonable system of maintenance and inspection would have prevented the injury as, firstly, there was no evidence as to what would constitute such a reasonable system, secondly, there was no evidence that established when inspections pursuant to such a system would occur, and, thirdly, there was no evidence that negated the possibility that the nail was inserted at a time after inspection of the court would have occurred (in accordance with a notional reasonable system) and before the injury was sustained.  
      
       
     48 Mr Maconachie conceded during the course of argument, however, that, if the nail had been inserted in the concrete prior to Mr Nolan’s final inspection in February 1997, the appellant had breached its duty of care by failing to observe the nail and remove it.  
      
       
     49 In my opinion, that concession was correctly made. At the stage of the final inspection, and before the court was made available for use by the public, the appellant, as part of its duty of care, should have taken reasonable care to ensure that the surface was smooth and free of obstruction. The exercise of reasonable care during that inspection would have led to the discovery of the nail. 
      
       
     50 In my opinion, the appeal falls to be resolved on the basis that, on a balance of probabilities, the nail was indeed inserted in the concrete in the course of the construction of the slab, and not by a third party (presumably a vandal) thereafter. That finding leads inevitably to a conclusion that, at the final inspection in February 1997, the appellant breached its duty of care by failing to observe the nail and remove it. I set out below my reasons for my finding that the nail was inserted in the concrete in the course of the construction of the slab.  
      
       
     51 The nail was of a singular kind. It was made of hardened steel. It was small, being only 20 millimetres in length (less than an inch). It had a small circular head about three millimetres in diameter. About five millimetres below the head there was a washer or flange about eight millimetres in diameter that appears to have been welded or at least permanently affixed in position. There were signs of rust on the upper surface of the flange. 
      
       
     52 Mr Maconachie’s principal submission was that, as a matter of probability, it could not be said that the nail was embedded in the concrete by the time of Mr Nolan’s inspection in February 1997. He said that it was equally (or more) likely that the nail had been hammered into the concrete by a vandal. 
      
       
     53 Mr Maconachie relied on two matters that he submitted supported his submission. The first was the evidence of Mr Caldwell, who was asked whether at any stage during the construction of the overall complex he saw any such nails driven into the concrete. He replied in the negative, saying that there was “no necessity for it”. Mr Caldwell said further that he had personally been involved with his employees in laying masking tape and painting line markings on the court and he had not seen the nail embedded in the concrete. The second matter relied on by Mr Machonachie was the history of vandalism on the site.  
      
       
     54 I shall deal firstly with the significance of Mr Caldwell’s evidence. That evidence has to be seen in context. The context includes the nature and purpose of the nail, how the nail came to be on the site, how it was inserted in the concrete and how it could possibly have been used in the course of construction.  
      
       
     55 I have described the singular nature of the nail. It was not a nail in ordinary domestic use. It was a highly specialised nail, intended for specialised and limited functions. Its size meant that it was not per se threatening. Indeed, the immediate impression on examining it is that it is an entirely insignificant object.  
      
       
     56 Mr Caldwell had seen the type of nail in question on building sites. He had not seen such a nail inserted in concrete and did not think it was “structurally strong enough” for this purpose. He appears to have been wrong in this regard. There was undisputed evidence that the nail was made of hardened steel and was specifically designed to be inserted in concrete.  
      
       
     57 Mr Caldwell said that he had seen the nail inserted “in mortar between brickwork”. He said that bricklayers would use the nail “to attach a string line into cement mortar in brickwork”. He, personally, would use the nail in mortar as a mark or as a string line attachment. He was not prepared to say that this was the only use for the nail.  
      
       
     58 There were bricklayers on the site in the course of construction. They were involved in putting up a wall within metres of the court. They might have brought nails of the kind in question on to the site but it is unlikely that any of them would have inserted the nail in the concrete slab as they did not work on the slab. There were, in addition, other tradesmen not under Mr Caldwell’s control working in and around the site. They, too, might have brought such nails on to the site but, for the same reason, it is unlikely that any of them would have inserted the nail in the slab. 
      
       
     59 Mr Bull, a carpenter employed by the appellant, gave evidence on its behalf. His testimony regarding the nature and function of the nail differed from that of Mr Caldwell. In particular, he said that he had used nails of that kind in the course of laying concrete slabs. When asked how they were put into the concrete he replied that they were nailed in with a hammer (White Book 79K-T). He said that while “you might bend a few … you eventually get them in.”  
      
       
     60 Mr Bull said he used such nails in the course of inserting expansion joints in concrete slabs. There were expansion joints in the court on which the respondent was injured. 
      
       
     61 The report of Mr Burn, a consulting engineer, was tendered in evidence by the respondent. Mr Burn was not cross-examined. Mr Burn stated in his report that the nail was “a hand driven concrete nail used for fixing sheet metal or plastic flags or tags or markers on concrete surfaces”. In other words, his evidence, like that of Mr Bull, was that the nail was designed to be inserted into concrete. His description of the use for which the nails were intended was significant as there were lines on the basketball court and there would have been a need to use some mechanism to ensure that the lines were correctly marked.  
      
       
     62 Mr Bull found the nail embedded in the concrete about a metre “outside the markings for the [basketball] hoop”. He remembered that there were “two lines coming from the baseline” which ended up in a circle shape, and the nail was near these lines. The position of the nail when found was not inconsistent with it having been used for marking lines on the court. 
      
       
     63 Significantly, the unchallenged finding by Sidis DCJ that the nail was on the site “as a result of” the construction of the court means, implicitly, that the nail was brought on to the site for some reason connected with its construction. In any event, once it is accepted that the nail was brought on to the site while the courts were being constructed, the strong inference arises that it was brought there by a worker for the purpose for which the nail was designed. 
      
       
     64 In my view - despite Mr Caldwell’s testimony that there was no need for nails of the kind in question to be used on the site - it would be reasonable to expect that those persons who brought such nails on to the site would use them for such a purpose, namely, for inserting expansion joints or erecting plastic flags or tags or markers in the course of painting lines on the court. 
      
       
     65 Photographs tendered in evidence showed that the nail was hammered neatly in to the concrete right up to the level of the flange. Mr Bull said that the flange had not been driven down to the top of the concrete, but this evidence is contrary to what is plainly visible in the photographs. That being so, the nail protruded above the surface by no more than about 5 millimetres. Evidence to the effect that the nail protruded by some 15 millimetres must be rejected. Rather, the nail was inserted into the concrete to a depth of about 15 millimetres. 
      
       
     66 Accordingly, it would have been difficult for a person not knowing of the nail’s existence in the concrete, and not making a careful examination of the surface of the slab, to see and notice the nail. The respondent left the nail in the concrete after his fall and some 21 months passed before Mr Bull, on instructions, went to the court to look for the nail and found it embedded there. In this lengthy period the nail appears to have gone unnoticed by any person. In my view, therefore, it does not follow from the failure by Mr Caldwell and his men to observe the nail when they were working on the slab that it was not there.  
      
       
     67 It is also to be observed that Mr Caldwell said that he was on site every day of the job, but was not there all the time. It follows that the nail may have been inserted in the concrete in his absence.  
      
       
     68 In the circumstances, I do not regard Mr Caldwell’s testimony as persuasively refuting the proposition that the nail was inserted in the concrete during the course of construction. 
      
       
     69 I now turn to the inference to be drawn from the vandalism at the site at the time in question.  
      
       
     70 According to a report by Mr Nolan dated 8 August 2000: 
      
       
        
         
         “Vandalism on the Edgeworth site was worst of all three sites. The netball post was removed twice, and finally replaced by a basketball post to placate local male youths. The picnic table was removed and thrown in the creek. Litter was regularly strewn around site. Handball wall and shelter were extensively grafittied. Broken glass was spread over court, but basketball key was swept by youths so they could play. Tap and bubbler vandalised repeatedly and finally disconnected.” 
         
        
       
     71 Mr Nolan’s oral testimony was to the same effect. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[T]here was vandalism to not so much the court surface but the wall and shelter, there was a lot of broken glass. In one, one instance when I was out there, the court surface was, was covered with broken glass except for the actual key area of the basketball court”. 
         
        
        
       Mr Nolan explained that the “key area” was the semi-circular area on the court where people using the court “could shoot … baskets”. 
        
       
     72 Mr Caldwell described the vandalism as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The concrete path I mentioned we had to put in, we had to put traffic barriers in, dig holes and concrete the traffic barriers into the ground. We did that one afternoon. We came to work the next morning and they’d been just ripped out of the ground. The actual netball post had been dislodged and thrown in the stormwater drain down behind the bowling club”. 
         
        
       
     73 In addition: 
      
       
        
         
         “[T]hey did unbolt the seating of the table from underneath the shelter. That was unbolted and actually thrown down in the park. They actually tried to destroy the actual four posted shelter. They just rocked it backwards and forwards till it was – we had to put in extra additional bracing to try and remedy that”. 
         
        
       
     74 Other damage was caused. Mr Caldwell referred to vandals breaking certain timber and mentioned a fire that had been started in a garbage bin. He said that “the traffic barrier posts were ripped out, these were replaced and they had been ‘cut off’.” Eventually a basketball post was installed instead of a netball post. This seems to have reduced the incidence of vandalism.  
      
       
     75 Nevertheless, when Mr Caldwell returned for the final handover there were rocks and broken glass “and stuff like that” on the surface of the court. In cross-examination he said that there were rocks and broken glass on the surface “just about every time he went there”. 
      
       
     76 The vandalism that took place at the site was overt, violent, apparently spontaneous and aimed at property or at preventing the court from being used. The knocking in of the nail up to the level of the flange was conduct of a different character. It differed from smashing a shelter, breaking down basketball posts, throwing glass and other debris onto the court and burning garbage bins. None of the vandalism involved the deliberate and careful creation of a concealed trap that might harm some unsuspecting basketball player (such as inserting a nail so that it protruded only some five millimetres above the surface of the concrete). 
      
       
     77 Moreover, the theory that a vandal knocked this single, specialised, seemingly insignificant nail into the concrete is based on a number of unlikely assumptions.  
      
       
     78 The vandal would have had to find the nail lying around on the site. While this is possible, the person in question would have had to have been equipped with a hammer to knock the nail in. This, immediately, reduces the likelihood of the hypothesis. Why should such a person come to the site armed with a hammer? There was no evidence that the damage that was inflicted on the site was caused by a hammer. That such a person would bring a hammer (but not nails) to the site and then look about for nails to knock into the court, cannot be regarded as probable conduct. 
      
       
     79 Then why knock in such a small nail? That conduct would not be an immediately obvious and destructively anti-social gesture of the kind that the vandals did indulge in. The nail protruded by so small an extent above the surface that it might never have caused anyone to fall, even if a basketball player stood on or against it. One would expect that if vandals wished to cause injury to persons or damage to the court by knocking hardened nails into the concrete they would have used far longer nails than the one in question. 
      
       
     80 Next, why knock in only one nail? After all, the theory assumes that the individual brought a hammer with him or her for the purpose of knocking nails in to the court. The idea that such a person would deliberately bring a hammer but not several nails, and knock in only a single nail found on site, cannot be regarded as likely.  
      
       
     81 Further, I take into account the fact that from the photographs the nail looks as if it was hammered into the contract neatly and professionally. There was no damage to the concrete in the vicinity of the nail and it looks as if the flange fits snugly against the surface. The nail does not look as if it was inserted by a casual act of vandalism. 
      
       
     82 In my opinion, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, it is probable that a person involved in the construction of the court inserted the nail in the concrete. In my view, this scenario is far more likely than the vandal theory advanced by Mr Machonachie. I regard the latter as mere speculation; unlike the first scenario, it is not based on conduct to be expected in the ordinary course of human behaviour. 
      
       
     83 I stress that the trial judge found and Mr Maconachie accepted that the nail was inserted under one of only two possible circumstances. Firstly, during the construction of the court. Secondly, by some third party, after construction had been completed. I am satisfied that the finding was correct and the concession was correctly made. There is no third possibility. 
      
       
     84 The probability of the first scenario occurring is far greater than the second. Accordingly, I would hold that a person employed in the construction of the court inserted the nail in the concrete before the completion of the court in February 1997. 
      
       
     85 I therefore conclude that those persons who participated in the inspection of the court in February 1997 failed to find the nail because they did not carry out the inspection properly and with due care. 
      
       
     86 I would dismiss the appeal with costs. 
      
       
     87 There is one further aspect of the case that needs to be addressed. 
      
       
     88 The written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant bore very little relationship to the full and detailed argument advanced orally by Mr Maconachie. Mr Maconachie candidly informed the Court that he had been briefed a considerable period before argument took place but did not supplement the written argument which, it seems, had been prepared by someone else. Mr Maconachie had earlier informed Mr Rowe for the respondent of the gist of the argument he was to present and Mr Rowe was not taken by surprise by the departure from the written submissions. This, however, was of no assistance to the Court.  
      
       
     89 The Court has a heavy burden of cases and if judgments are to be delivered within a reasonable time it is desirable that judgments in more straightforward cases be delivered at the conclusion of oral argument. Otherwise the period between argument and the delivery of judgment will grow to an inordinate degree. This process however will be prevented if the oral argument differs in substance from the written submissions. 
      
       
     90 In Whyte v Brosch (1998) 45 NSWLR 354 Spigelman CJ said (at 355): 
      
       
        
         
         “The ability to deliver ex tempore reasons in cases of this character is a matter of considerable significance for the efficient use of judicial resources. Accordingly, compliance by the parties of Pt 51 r 47 is of importance for the efficient use of judicial resources in the administration of justice in this State”. 
         
        
        
       And (at 355 to 356): 
        
        
         
         “In a case where the opposing party seeks an adjournment of proceedings by reason of the late filing of submissions, if the Court grants the adjournment in accordance with its usual approach, the profession ought to be aware that the Court can order that costs thrown away by any adjournment should be paid by the legal practitioner responsible for the failure. 
         
        
        
         
         Other possible sanctions include a reference to one of the professional associations to investigate whether any breach of professional obligations has occurred”. 
         
        
       
     91 In Lorbergs v State of New South Wales (1999) NSWCA 54 Mason P said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Court of Appeal is an extremely busy court. Judges read the submissions in advance of the hearing. Sometimes the convenient time to do this is the weekend prior to the week in which the matter is fixed for hearing. It is important to have this facility so that the argument can proceed with proper despatch and so that in a proper case ex tempore reasons can be delivered”. 
         
        
        
       Mason P reminded the profession about the warning issued by Spigelman CJ in  
       Whyte v Brosch 
       , referred to the pervasive “climate of complacency” and said: 
        
        
         
         “Without suggesting this remark is applicable to any of the present cases, I should say that these attitudes are indicative of contempt in both its technical and lay senses”. 
         
        
       
     92 Everything said in Whyte v Brosch and Lorbergs v State of New South Wales in regard to the need to file written submissions in time applies equally to the need to file written submissions that adequately reflect the arguments that the parties intend to develop orally at the hearing of the appeal. Otherwise, the entire purpose of the rule relating to the filing of written submissions will be frustrated. 
      
       
     93 Where, after written submissions have been filed, new counsel is briefed who wishes to present different arguments, the new counsel is duty bound to ensure that amended written submissions, properly reflecting the new arguments, are filed in good time. 
      
       
     94 Mr Maconachie apologised to the court for his omission in filing adequate submissions in good time. His apology was accepted and in the circumstances of this case I do not suggest that any sanction be imposed.

      70066/01 R v Edward George THURSTON 
       
       
      JUDGMENT -  
      Re Application to discharge jury and change of venue; see T 168. 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This trial commenced last Wednesday when the jury was empanelled and the accused put in their charge and a voir dire was then commenced. The jury was excused until Thursday, then to Friday, and now they have been excused until Tuesday. The voir dire has not yet been completed, and the Crown prosecutor has not yet opened the case to the jury. 
     
      
    2 On Friday I saw fit to discharge one of the jurors who it turned out was a distant relation of the deceased. There is now an application on behalf of the accused Lamb to discharge the whole jury, and also for a change of venue to Sydney. 
     
      
    3 Initially the Crown opposed the application to discharge the jury and submitted that the trial should continue with the remaining eleven jurors. This morning the learned Crown prosecutor has indicated that he no longer adheres to that submission, as he has ascertained that steps are in train to summon a new jury panel for next Monday. That, I might add, has been done as a result of steps instigated by me on Friday when the question first arose; and I might add that it has required almost superhuman efforts on the part of the Sheriff's Office to arrange a new jury panel and deliver the jury notices to Tamworth by courier, so that most of them can be hand delivered, as the jurors are required to have reasonable notice. Actually the Jury Act 1977 s 26(3) requires that they have at least seven days notice, but I have power to reduce the length of notice if occasion arises. 
     
      
    4 There is also the problem of rearranging the Judges' roster, as it is not easy to organise the listing of other cases when cases are delayed or run over time, but I am assured by the List Judge that if this trial extends an extra week or two because of starting again next week, it will be difficult, but not impossible, to rearrange the roster to cope with commitments that have been planned for me. 
     
      
    5 The voir dire that has not yet been completed can continue this week so the time will not be entirely wasted. 
     
      
    6 My initial view was to continue with the remaining eleven jurors, and I do not believe that the verdicts, whether verdicts of guilty or not guilty, would be any different whether there was a jury of eleven or of twelve. But having regard to the fact that it is a very early stage of the trial, that the Crown has not yet opened, that the Crown no longer opposes the discharge of the remaining jurors, that the time spent on the voir dire will not be wasted, that we can have a new jury panel here by next Monday, and having regard also to the remarks of McHugh and Kirby JJ in Wu v The Queen (1999) 108 A Crim R 252 (although the latter's judgment was a dissenting judgment) I consider that the wiser course is to discharge the remainder of the jury, and I will do so. 
     
      
    7 As I say, persons summoned for jury service are normally entitled to seven days notice unless the judge otherwise orders. In view of the circumstances that have arisen I order otherwise, and I reduce the time so that the jury summonses delivered by Wednesday of this week will be valid for next Monday, although I understand most of them will be delivered today or tomorrow. 
     
      
    8 There is also an application on behalf of the accused Lamb to change the venue to Sydney. This is on the ground that there is strong feeling, and there have been threats of reprisals, against the accused by members of the deceased's family. In particular, reference was made to an incident in court last week during the voir dire when it was alleged that some of the deceased's family in the public gallery were making gestures towards the accused Lamb and then, on Friday, I discharged a juror because a member of the deceased's family made an approach to the juror's mother at the juror's place of business. The approach, as I said when discharging the juror, may have been entirely innocent, and I am not suggesting otherwise, and I discharged the juror not because of the approach, but because of the underlying relationship. 
     
      
    9 I was also referred to Exhibit L2 on the voir dire where, shortly after the death of the deceased, members of his family threatened reprisals and were counselled by Detective Coe to desist. 
     
      
    10 Attention was drawn to the fact that there is the likelihood of the deceased's family attending the trial every day, that Tamworth is a comparatively small city and there is a real chance that members of the family will, or may, come into conduct with jurors from this area or the city, and accordingly application is made for a change of venue to Sydney. 
     
      
    11 The Crown opposes the change of venue and refers to the longstanding tradition and practice that trials should be conducted where the alleged offence was committed, subject to the obvious exception if there is the risk of an unfair trial. 
     
      
    12 In this case the Crown will be calling a large number of lay witnesses, mostly of aboriginal background who have never been to Sydney. To arrange transport and accommodation for all these witnesses will create logistical and expense problems and, indeed, there will probably be a need to provide someone to look after them, because a large number of them would not be familiar with a metropolitan city. It would also be of considerable hardship for the witnesses, or at least some of them, to be transported to a strange place and an unfamiliar environment and kept there for a number of days whilst they are waiting to give evidence. 
     
      
    13 The Crown also submits that it would be almost impossible to ensure the attendance of all of them to give evidence. 
     
      
    14 The family is entitled to attend the trial, and this is conceded but, although not expressed, the underlying suggestion in defence counsel’s submission appears to be that a number of the deceased's family would be deterred by cost and other commitments from attending a three week trial in Sydney, or elsewhere, other than Tamworth. 
     
      
    15 The possible problems of jurors coming into contact with members of the deceased's family can be overcome in a number of ways. It has already been overcome in respect of the existing juror by discharging that juror, and similar steps could be taken, if necessary, again, although I do not anticipate such steps would again be necessary. 
     
      
    16 Moreover, before the jury is empanelled in the next trial, in addition to having the Crown read out the names of the witnesses intended to be called by the Crown, I shall also ask the Crown to read out the names of the deceased's family who may be living in or visiting Tamworth during the course of the trial and inviting any jurors who know them to apply to be stood aside. 
     
      
    17 In addition, I had, last Friday at the end of the day's proceedings, given a strong warning in what I regard as clear and unmistakable terms, to the members of the deceased's family that they must not engage in any sort of threatening conduct, or attempt to approach jurors in any way, and that if they do the trial will again be aborted and this will happen as often as is necessary to ensure that the accused get a fair trial. 
     
      
    18 The alleged threats made of reprisals shortly after the death of the deceased were probably made in the heat of the moment and no doubt cooler counsel has since prevailed and, in any event, both accused are in custody, bail refused, and so they are protected from any attempts of physical violence that may otherwise be visited on them. 
     
      
    19 For these reasons the application to change the venue to Sydney is refused.

        Regina v F 
        
        
       The accused was charged with the indecent assault of five former pupils. The crown originally consented to presenting individual indictments, but there was no formal order made. Verdicts of not guilty were entered when the respondent stood trial on charges against the first complainant. On 24th October, the DPP filed a notice of motion seeking that the charges be heard in a joint trial. The respondent opposed the joinder of the counts. Judge Hock ruled against the respondent, and indicated that, subject to the question of concoction, the crown would be entitled to present the indictment with the counts joined. The judge then went on to consider whether there was sufficient similarity in the evidence for it to qualify as coincidence or tendency evidence, and she held that there was. Judge Hock found that the possibility of concoction had been excluded, except in the case of JPMcF. The Crown conceded that if evidence of the various complainants was not admissible as tendency or coincidence evidence, then the trials should be separated. Thus, it was held that the trial of JPMcF should be heard separately, and the trials for the remaining three complainants should be joined. At no stage was a formal order made concerning the application by the defence for separate trials, nor for the severance of the trial involving JPMcF. The crown appealed the decision to separate the trial of JPMcF, and a preliminary submission was lodged by the respondent seeking separate trials.  
       
      
      
       
       Held: 
        (dismissing crown appeal, granting leave to respondent to appeal, but dismissing the appeal): 
       
      
      
       
       Whether the Court has jurisdiction to hear the Crown Appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act: 
        Determination of the question of joinder or severance of the counts was at the heart of the pre-trial hearing. Having regard to the character and effect of the decision made by the pre-trial judge, the case falls properly for review under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act.

       Whether the respondent should be given leave to appeal: 
        Having regard to the way in which the Crown has changed its position, it would be unfair to the respondent if he were not given leave to appeal. Leave is confined to the joinder/severance issue which turned upon the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence. 
       
      
      
       
       Tendency and Coincidence Evidence: 
        The facts alleged by the complainants were substantially and relevantly similar, and the circumstances in which they occurred were substantially similar, despite some individual differences in detail. The existence of the related acts was not open to an innocent explanation. The evidence had a significant probative value, and the probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect on the respondent. The reasonable possibility of concoction has been excluded (except in the case of JPMcF) by the fact that the boys were of different ages and had no reason to socialise together. JPMcF had been informed by one complainant of an indecent assault before JPMcF made any complaint, and he acknowledged some awareness of similar allegations. There was a reasonable possibility of JPMcF’s evidence having been tainted by this knowledge, and there should be a separate trial in relation to this complaint.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 MEAGHER JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
      
       
     2 WOOD CJ at CL: This is an appeal brought by the Crown pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The circumstances in which it arises are somewhat complex. 
      
       
        
       BACKGROUND 
        
       
     3 In Summary: 
      
       
       (a) The accused, F, was initially charged with the indecent assault of five former pupils at a school where he was the gym master. He was committed for trial in May 2000 on all charges; 
        
        
       (b) On 22 January 2001, following representations by the solicitors for the respondent, the Crown consented to presenting individual indictments so that the charges against the five complainants would be heard separately. As a result they were set down by Judge Christie as back-to-back trials, to be heard separately in the District Court at Wagga Wagga. As the matter was dealt with by way of consent, at this stage, it appears that there was no formal order made for separation of the trials, nor was any consideration given to that question on the merits;  
        
       (c) On 14 May 2001, the respondent was arraigned before his Honour Judge Moore in that Court, on charges concerning one complainant, MSF. The Crown presented no evidence after certain preliminary rulings were made and verdicts of not guilty were entered; 
        
        
       (d) On 17 May 2001, the respondent was arraigned before Judge Moore upon the second set of charges involving the complainant GDG. By reason of an event, which was considered to have prejudiced a fair trial, the jury was discharged after the respondent had given evidence, and an order was made for a new trial; 
        
        
       (e) The remaining charges, including those involving GDG, were then set down for trial, as four back-to-back trials, to commence in the District Court at Sydney, on 29 October 2001. 
        
        
       (f) On 24 October 2001, the Director of Public Prosecutions filed a notice of motion seeking that the four sets of charges be heard by way of a joint trial (the respective complainants being the former pupils of the respondent: GDG, SAL, MHS and JPMcF). 
        
        
       (g) On 26 October 2001, the Crown served notices under sections 97 and 98 of the  
       Evidence Act 
        giving notice of its intention to rely upon the evidence of each of the complainants as tendency and coincidence evidence, going to show the guilt of the accused in relation to all counts. 
        
        
       (h) On 29 October 201 when the matter was called on for trial before her Honour Judge Hock, the Crown announced its intention of presenting an indictment, containing the five counts which had been preferred in respect of the four remaining complainants. The respondent opposed the joinder of the counts and submitted that there should be separate trials in relation to each complainant, as had originally been intended. 
        
        
       (i) There was some uncertainty when the matter came before Her Honour as to the correct procedure to be followed, that is as to whether a joint indictment should be presented in a preliminary hearing, followed by a defence application for separate trials; or whether separate indictments should be presented, followed by a Crown application for joinder of the indictments. Reference was made to the provisions of Part 53 of the  
       District Court Rules (Criminal Procedure), 
        in particular rule 11, which requires the accused to enter a plea in advance of any inquiry, by way of a voire dire, into the admissibility of evidence being ordered, and to the decision in  
       Regina v GLC, 
        NSWCCA 31 March 2000. It was there said that, if the question to be ventilated was one of admissibility, then it would be an irregularity to proceed without a plea being taken. However, it would appear that the Court considered that it would have been inappropriate to require a plea if the question was one of joinder or severance of the counts. Their Honours observed obiter, that it was “ 
       inappropriate for the question of possible concoction between the complainants to be heard concurrently with the motion for separate trials 
       .” No reason was given for this proposition, and I would question its correctness, as a general statement, since the question of severance may depend, as it does here, on the admissibility of the evidence as tendency or coincidence evidence, and that may turn upon the question of concoction. 
        
        
       (j) Mr Byrne SC objected to the course proposed by the Crown, having regard to its prior election to present separate indictments. Additionally he drew attention to the prejudice which could be occasioned by the late change of intention, which had only been flagged during the preceding week. It was his submission that separate indictments should be presented, followed by an application by the Crown for joinder of those indictments. Initially it was determined that this was the course which should be pursued, as it reflected the notice of motion filed by the Crown, as well as the history of the proceedings to that point. 
        
        
       (k) When the hearing resumed, after a short adjournment that day, Judge Hock drew attention to several decisions, including  
       Regina v Cooper, 
        NSWCCA 24 February 1998,  
       Connolly v Director of Public Prosecutions 
        (1964) AC 1254 and  
       Barton v The Queen 
        (1980) 147 CLR 75. Together it was suggested they recognised the discretion of the Crown to present an indictment as it saw fit, and the absence of any power in the court to order that separate indictments be joined in a single trial. 
        
        
       (l) It was then decided, although Mr Byrne SC made it clear that he maintained his objection to the joinder of the counts, that a joint indictment should be presented to which the respondent would plead, thereby enabling the relevant issues to be ventilated, including any request made by the respondent for separate trials. As appears from the transcript of 29 October 2001, and the judgment given on 31 October 2001, the requirements for the filing of a notice of motion (by the respondent) seeking separate trials were waived. 
        
        
       (m) The respondent was formally arraigned upon this basis, after which argument was received, by way of a preliminary point, as to whether the Crown should, in fairness, be permitted to depart from the orders which it was suggested had been made, at least by implication, by Judge Christie, and as to whether the respondent would be prejudiced by that course. 
        
        
       (n) In this regard, reference was made by Mr Byrne SC to the decision in  
       Regina v Saunders 
        (1994) 72 A Crim R 347 in support of a submission that absent “ 
       good and sufficient reasons 
       ”, and/or a material change in circumstances, the Crown should be held to the position to which it had originally consented.  
        
        
         
         It was also submitted by him that there was a risk of prejudice to the respondent in the course now proposed. That arose from the suggested availability of evidence, which could have been led in the first trial, as to the rumours which had spread throughout the school concerning the complainant in that case. Had the respondent been aware of the Crown’s intention to join the four current matters together, then, it was submitted, it may have been advantageous for him to have had all five sets of complaints heard in the one trial. 
         
        
        
         
         Additionally, it was suggested that, had the respondent been forewarned of the application, then the question of contamination could have been more actively pursued. 
         
        
        
         
         Finally it was submitted that there was a risk of prejudice in so far as the second trial which had initially been part heard (involving the complainant GDG), and which had been aborted through no fault on the part of the respondent, would now be conducted on a different basis, so far as tendency or coincidence evidence would be introduced, if the Crown was allowed to present a joint indictment. 
         
        
        
       (o) The Crown response to these submissions was three-fold: 
        
        
         
         (i) That  
         Saunders 
          was distinguishable in that it was a case where there had been an interlocutory decision on the merits to order separate trials, following a pre-trial application, which the Crown later sought to reverse by presenting a joint indictment;  
          
          
         (ii) That there had been a material change in circumstances, in so far as it had become apparent during the earlier trial involving the complainant GDG, that if, contrary to his denial of deliberate touching, the respondent had in fact touched that complainant in the way alleged, then it was an accidental event, having occurred during a gymnastic exercise on the horizontal bar, which he had been supervising. That possibility or “ 
         defence 
         ” of accident, which it was understood would arise in relation to all four complainants, the Crown submitted now made relevant the coincidence or tendency evidence thereby opening the way for a joinder of all counts; and that 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) Until, at latest, the making of the order by Judge Christie, the complainant must have been aware of the possibility of the counts having been heard together, so that the respondent should have had an adequate opportunity to explore the possibility of cross contamination and concoction. Additionally, it was put that there was no reason why the respondent could not, even now, pursue that line of defence, or have the complainant in the first trial (MSF) called and made available for cross examination; 
          
          
         
        
       (p) In reply, Mr Byrne SC made it clear that the defence was not strictly one of accident. Rather it involved a specific denial of any deliberate touching of any complainant on the penis, either inside or outside his shorts. Although, he added, by reason of the activities in which they had been engaged, there may have been occasions when there had been an inadvertent touching or brushing of the clothes or lower body of the boys. 
        
         
        
       (q) Upon the second morning of the pre trial hearing (on 30 October 2001), Judge Hock ruled against the respondent in relation to the preliminary argument, and indicated that, subject to the question of concoction, the Crown would be entitled to “ 
       present the indictment with the counts joined 
       .” Mr Byrne appropriately brought to her attention that there was an intervening step to be determined, namely whether there was sufficient similarity in the evidence of the various complainants for it to qualify as coincidence or tendency evidence. 
        
         
        
       (r) Her Honour then made it clear that the rulings given so far were confined to the preliminary issue, and indicated that the reasons for its determination would be given, when the remaining issues were decided, in a single judgment. 
        
        
         
         When later delivering the reasons for this preliminary ruling, on the third day of the hearing (31 October), Judge Hock said that she had distinguished  
         Saunders 
          on the basis that, unlike that case, there had here been no earlier decision on the merits, the “ 
         order for separate trials [having been] merely an endorsement of the position adopted by the Crown and the defence 
         ”. Next she indicated that she accepted the Crown submission that it was now “ 
         on notice of the defence, the accused having given evidence in the aborted trial,… and that this had the effect of a reassessment of the earlier decision to run all trials separately 
         .” Although not said in express terms, the clear implication was that this amounted to a change of circumstance and as such provided a good and sufficient reason to depart from the earlier position established by consent.  
          
         
        
        
       (s) Argument was received, following the ruling on the preliminary issue, confined to the statements of the four complainants, as to whether or not the evidence would qualify as coincidence or tendency evidence, and was of sufficient probative value, so as to pass the ss 97 and 98 and s 101 tests for admissibility. In the course of these submissions, the Crown made it clear that if the evidence of the various complainants was not admissible as tendency or coincidence evidence, then it accepted that the trials should be separated; but otherwise if the evidence was admissible as such. 
        
        
       (t) Arising out of the submissions, and the express acceptance by the Crown that, if Judge Hock was “ 
       against [the Crown] on [its] application under s 97 and 98 then [it] would separate the trials and not lead the evidence of any other complainant in one particular complainant’s case 
       ”, she noted “ 
       in those circumstances what we are really dealing with now is the question of admissibility of evidence as opposed to separate trials.”  
        
        
       (u) At that point, reasons in the terms noted above (sub para (r)) were formally delivered on the preliminary argument for which a ruling had been given the previous day. Next, her Honour said: 
        
         
         “ 
         on the question of the admissibility of the evidence, my preliminary view is that the evidence is relevant under s 55 and admissible under s 97, not excluded by s 101 unless there is a real possibility of concoction which is the issue that we are now about to deal with and I will deliver a judgment at the conclusion of the evidence and any further submissions that might be made.” 
         
        
         
        
         
         After inquiry by Mr Byrne SC, her Honour noted that she considered the evidence admissible: 
          
         “ 
         …at least under s 98 but s 97 raises the same question so we certainly need to embark on the next stage…I should make clear that this inquiry on the voir dire should be limited to the issue of contamination/concoction…” 
         
        
        
       (v) Thereafter evidence was taken, on the voir dire, on the third and fourth days of the preliminary hearing from the four complainants as well as from two police officers who had been involved in the investigation and from a former student (MB). Some additional material was tendered and taken into account, including the committal depositions, the transcript of the trial before Judge Moore (involving GDG), the statements from the mothers of GDG, SAL and JPMcF, a newspaper article of 15 September 1988, a letter from Wagga Wagga City Council, and the s 97/98 notices. 
        
        
       (w) At the commencement of the fifth day of the hearing, Judge Hock delivered a judgment in which she initially made it clear that she had concluded that the evidence would qualify as coincidence evidence, observing: 
        
        
         
          
           
           “ 
           As I understand it, the accused denies each offence and therefore the issue is did he in fact indecently assault any such complainant. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           It seems to me that, on that fact in issue, it is relevant under s 55 of the Evidence Act that a number of other people allege that they too were similarly sexually assaulted by the accused when they were school boys and when the accused was their teacher 
           .” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         After recording that notices had been served under s 97 (tendency) and 98 (coincidence) of the  
         Evidence Act 
         , she said: 
         
        
        
         
         “ 
         The tendency relied on by the Crown, as I understand it, is the tendency of the accused to touch boys between the ages of twelve to fourteen on the penis. The Crown sets out in point form, (a) to (p), at page 2 of the written submissions which form part of Exhibit A, the similarities on which it relies in respect of s 98. Although not all of the points appear to apply, it seems to me there are sufficient similarities to meet the requirements of s 98(1) and (2). See Zappala CCA 4 November 1991.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (x) She next recorded a finding that the evidence of the other complainants did have a significant probative value to the fact in issue, before noting that: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “(a) tendency and coincidence evidence cannot be used against a defendant unless its probative value outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on that defendant (s 101(2) of the Evidence Act; and that 
            
           (b) the test to be applied is that the evidence is admissible where there is no other reasonable explanation for it other than the guilt of the defendant (Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461).” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (y) The relevant question for consideration she identified as the possibility of concoction, which in accordance with the decision in  
       Hoch v The Queen 
        (1988) 165 CLR 292 at 297, requires examination of the facts of the case and the circumstances of the witnesses, in particular, their relationship to one another, and the opportunity and possible motive for concoction. 
       
      
      
       
       (z) After a review of the material placed before her on the voir dire, Judge Hock found, by reference to the fact that the boys had been in different classes; to the fact that with one exception they had not known each other; and to the timing of their complaints and statements to the police; that the possibility of concoction had been excluded save in relation to JPMcF, since he had been informed by GDG of his allegation almost immediately after the incident which he had described, and before making a complaint himself. She then expressed her conclusion as follows: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         In my opinion, coincidence is not available as a reasonable explanation consistent with innocence nor is there any evidence of a financial motive or grudge against the school in general or the accused in particular. There does not seem to me to have been any antipathy towards the accused by any of the complainants prior to the alleged incidents. I do not find there is a real as opposed to a speculative possibility of concoction between (MHS, SAL and GDG): see Colby (1999) NSWCCA 261 at para 111 
         . 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In the absence of those possibilities, in my view there is no reasonable conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused. Therefore, I would not exercise my discretion under section 101 to reject the evidence, nor am I obliged to exclude it by the operation of s 137.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The evidence is admitted under s 97 and s 98 
         .” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (aa) It is clear from the concluding sentence that whatever uncertainty may have existed to that point, there was a ruling that the evidence was admissible both as tendency and coincidence evidence. At that stage no order was made, in any formal way, concerning the application by the defence for a separate trial, nor for that matter of the severance of the trial involving JPMcF, although as I next observe, this was the inevitable result of the ruling.  
       
      
      
       
       (ab) After delivering judgment, the following exchange occurred: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         HER HONOUR: Where do we go from there? 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         BYRNE: Your Honour, that effectively means a separate trial for the [JPMcF] allegation. 
          
          
         HER HONOUR: Yes. 
          
          
         BYRNE: And there are two of those. 
          
          
         HER HONOUR: Yes. 
          
          
         BYRNE: And a joint trial, as I understand your Honour’s ruling, in relation to the [GDG, MHS and SAL] allegations? 
          
          
         HER HONOUR: Yes.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (ac) When Mr Byrne SC asked for an adjournment so that the matter could be further explored, Judge Hock indicated that she would need to be persuaded why the trial involving JPMcF should not commence on the following day. At that point there was a short adjournment, after which the Crown indicated that it wished to take the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and sought an adjournment of the JPMcF trial itself. There followed a further exchange as follows: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         HER HONOUR: Mr Byrne, you’d probably know better than I would, this is a ruling on admissibility of evidence as I understood it.  
          
          
         BYRNE: No, it’s not with respect your Honour, I suppose it can be looked at in two ways. It is effectively a ruling on a question of whether a trial should be separate or not so that it would be at least our submission – and whilst my learned friend says we are all taking it to the Court of Criminal Appeal, my understanding is that the Crown is taking it to the Court of Criminal Appeal to challenge the decision to separate one of the trials. Now in those circumstances we would not be seeking leave to appeal to join them together although we would be – that’s the submission we would ultimately make in response to the Crown’s argument but it’s the Crown’s appeal at this stage and of course, as your Honour knows, the Crown has an appeal as of right under section 5F rather than by way of leave but it’s not a question of admissibility of evidence, I wouldn’t have thought, it is a question that is really categorized as a joint or separate trial issue and that, it has been held in the past, to be an appropriate 5F matter. 
         ” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (ad) In further developing the defence position, Mr Byrne SC made it clear, despite his earlier application for an adjournment that he was ready to proceed with the trial involving JMcF, observing: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         It may well be that the court takes the view that your Honour has raised that it is a question of admissibility of evidence but our submission would be that it is essentially a question of separate or joint trials and that is a 5F issue. So if the Crown is exercising its rights there is nothing we can do about that, we can’t object tot he course that they suggest, it’s a course which is open to them, all we can say is to have it put on the record that we are here ready to proceed in relation to the trial of [JDMcF] which, according to your Honour’s ruling earlier this morning, (we) would be ready to do tomorrow and we would be happy to proceed with that tomorrow but we can’t as it were interfere with the Crown exercising the rights which it has under section 5F. 
         ” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (ae) After a short adjournment to consider these developments, Judge Hock delivered a judgment, which she described as one “ 
       in respect of the admissibility of certain evidence 
       ” and noted that the Crown intended to lodge an appeal from the judgment. With some reservations, she indicated that she would vacate the trial, which had been listed for the following day, and directed that all trials of the respondent be listed at a date which she nominated in April 2002 
       
      
      
       
       THE APPEAL 
       
     4 As I have observed the Crown appeal is brought in relation to an order “that the trial of the accused in respect of charges involving the complainant [JPMcF] be separated from the trial of the accused in respect of charges involving other complainants”. 5 A preliminary submission was lodged by the respondent, noting that he: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “ 
           will contend on this appeal that the Court should exercise its powers under s 5F(5)(b) (sic) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and make an order that there should be a separate trial of the charges involving each of the four individual complainants. This is the order that was sought on the respondent’s behalf in the interlocutory proceedings from which the Crown’s appeal is brought. 
           ” 
           
          
         
        
       
     6 In reply, a submission was presented by the DPP to the effect that since there had been no applications on the part of the respondent for leave to appeal (under 5F(3)(b)) from her Honour’s decision, (or, I would add, a certificate from her Honour) the Court should not make the order sought by him. 
      
       
       JURISDICTION 
       
     7 A preliminary question thus arises in the circumstances outlined, whether the Court: 
      
       
       (a) has jurisdiction to entertain the Crown appeal under s 5F; and whether it 
        
       (b) should give the respondent leave to appeal. 
       
      
      
       
     8 Both issues arise by reason of the absence of any formal order having been made for severance or joinder of the counts, either by Judge Christie on 22 January 2001, or by Judge Hock following her Honour’s ruling, which essentially went to a question of the admissibility of the evidence of the various complainants. The matter is not made any easier by the fact that the motion which was in fact before her Honour was misconceived, in so far as it was within the discretion of the Crown to present an indictment, in the circumstances of this case (absent any earlier determination on the merits), as it saw fit. 9 In that regard while the District Court (Criminal Procedure) Rules  Part 53, rule 10, do permit determination of an application for pre-trial for severance of counts, the rule is silent in relation to the joinder of counts.10 Essential to a review under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act is the existence of an “interlocutory judgment or order”. A wide range of matters have been held to fall within the ambit of this expression, including orders for, or refusal of, separate trials (R v Saunders and R v Georgiou (1999) NSWCCA 125). However, rulings on the admissibility of evidence have been held not to be interlocutory judgments or orders within the meaning of the section: R v Powch  (1988) 14 NSWLR 136, R v Rogerson (1990) 45 A Crim R 253, R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 30 and R v Bailey (1988) 36 A Crim R 633; save where the consequence of the judgment is to rule out all of the Crown evidence leaving it without a case: R v Bozatis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296.11 The distinction, it seems, depends in the case of a judgment, upon it determining the proceedings, or at least an identifiable part of them, and being capable of entry in the records of the Court: R v Steffan at 636; or in the case of an order, upon it amounting to a command that something be done or not done: The King v Snow (1915) 20 CLR 315 at 324, 361, and Steffan at 636. In Steffan it was said that it was not immediately self evident how a ruling upon the admissibility of evidence could answer either description. Additionally it was noted that an evidentiary ruling lacks finality, in that it can be changed in the course of the trial. 12 The immediate question for determination is whether in this case, absent the making of a formal order for severance or joinder of the counts, the Court should entertain the Crown appeal, or give leave to the respondent to pursue his contention.13 While it would have been preferable for formal orders to have been made, I consider it clear that, behind the admissibility issue, was the question critical for both parties, whether there should be a joint trial as the Crown sought, or separate trials as the defence sought. This issue had been raised from the outset, and it was the sole reason why the coincidence/tendency notices had been served. The Crown did not want a joint trial unless the evidence of the various complainants was admissible as tendency/coincidence evidence. 14 The sole reason why it now brings this appeal is to have the two counts involving JPMcF joined with the counts involving the co-complainants. In order to do that it must displace the finding of Judge Hock as to the possibility of concoction on his part. Underlying its appeal, and its earlier opposition to the trial involving JPMcF commencing in October 2001, is its assessment that proof of tendency or coincidence involving all complainants will strengthen its case generally. 15 For the reasons identified, both the Crown and the defence have an interest in obtaining the decision of this Court as to whether there should be a joinder or severance of the counts. The only formality lacking was the making by Hock DCJ of an order in express terms refusing the defence application for separate trials, on the one hand, and the making of an order directing a separate trial of the JPMcF counts on the other hand. However, since the determination of the question of joinder or severance was at the heart of the pre-trial hearing, and since the admissibility decision inevitably involved the determination of that question, I would regard Steffan as distinguishable, in so far as it was concerned simply with the question whether the evidence of certain conversations had been recorded illegally, and upon that basis was inadmissible.16 Bozatis and Spanakakis, had some similarity with the present case in so far as the trial judge had made an order permanently staying the proceedings, as the necessary consequence of the evidentiary ruling which he had made, that being an order which was amenable to a review under s 5F. Gleeson CJ, with whom Meagher JA and Bruce J agreed, observed at 303-304: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Quite apart from discretionary considerations relating to a grant of leave, where leave to appeal is required, there are numerous judicial statements to the effect that, generally speaking, a ruling on the admissibility of evidence, before or during a trial, is not a judgment or order within the meaning of s 5F. The case of Steffan is an example. (There are dicta to the opposite effect (eg Chow v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 610-611; 63 A Crim R 316 at 330-332).) However, in Steffan (at 640-641; 513) the Court of Criminal Appeal said that there may well be a ‘rare case’ where a ruling on evidence,  
         because it formed the basis of a stay of proceedings 
         , could be the principal legal issue to be determined of a s 5F appeal. 
          
          
         In Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197 Sheller JA observed that the authorities have established no bright line test for discriminating between judgments or orders, on the one hand, and rulings which do not constitute judgments or orders, on the other. King CJ, in Legal Practitioners’ Complaint Committee v A Practitioner (1987) 46 SASR 126 drew a distinction between judgments or orders and what he called ‘incidental rulings’. A judgment or order, he said, is a ‘judicial act which decides the question or one of the questions which is raised for decision in the particular proceedings’. However, rulings also decide questions. It is the character of the question, and  
         the effect of the decision 
         , that makes the difference.  
          
          
         One of the reasons given for denying to a ruling on evidence, in the ordinary case, the quality of a judgment or order is that it can be changed during the course of the proceedings. It lacks finality. It does not require a decision of an appellate court to reverse it; at least in theory the judge can be persuaded to alter it. 
          
          
         In Commonwealth v Mullane (1961) 106 CLR 166 the High Court had to consider whether a decision under review, which involved a ruling on a point of law, amounted to a judgment, decree, order or sentence. In a passage at 169, cited by Sheller JA in Lethlean, the court said 
         : 
          
          
           
           ‘ 
           What his Honour did was simply to give a ruling on a point of law which was raised. It did not conclude the rights of the parties before the hearing of the case was completed. The County Court judge might have altered his mind, he might have ruled otherwise, he might have qualified his ruling, there was no determination. 
           ’ 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Bellear DCJ, in a passage quoted above, dealt with para 2 of the Notice of Motion by saying that he was making an order excluding ‘all prosecution evidence’ against the respondents. What is important is not his Honour’s use of the word ‘order’, but the character and  
         effect of the decision 
          he was making. He was not merely deciding that some particular piece of evidence was admissible or inadmissible. He was making a discretionary decision not to receive any evidence tending to prove the guilt of the respondents of the offences charged. He was, in substance, refusing to permit the Crown to seek to make a case against the appellants. Such a decision is properly characterized as a judgment or order. 
         ” 
          (Emphasis added). 
         
        
       
     17 In my view, having regard to the character and effect of the decision made by Hock J, the present is a case which falls properly for review under s 5F. In this regard it bears some similarity to Regina v T, NSWCCA 19 October 1988 where an appeal under s 5F, brought by the accused, was heard by the Court. It involved a challenge to orders made for the joinder of a number of counts involving several children, who had been pupils of the accused, effectively into two groups which the trial judge directed were to be tried separately from one another. The separation of the two groups followed his Honour’s findings that they were factually different. The joinder of the counts within each group followed a finding first that the evidence concerning them amounted to similar facts, and second that there was no real chance of it being tainted by collusion, fantasy or suggestion. The difference between the two cases lies only in the fact that formal orders for joinder and severance were there made, and a certificate was given by his Honour under s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
      
       
     18 While the Crown appeal lies of right, I am satisfied having regard to the history of the proceedings, and in particular the way in which the Crown has changed its position, that it would be unfair to the respondent if he were not given leave to appeal, so as to argue the application which he had made, and which did not find favour with her Honour. 
      
       
     19 In this regard, I would however confine that leave to the admissibility of severance points. The threshold point it seems to me, truly involved a discretionary consideration as to whether the admissibility and joinder issues should be entertained at all. It did not, in my view, amount to an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of the authorities. Even if it did, I am not persuaded that error was demonstrated in that regard.  
      
       
        
       TENDENCY AND COINCIDENCE EVIDENCE 
        
       
     20 As I have observed, a critical question for determination, in relation to the admissibility of the evidence, was whether it qualified as tendency or coincidence evidence. That question was dealt with somewhat briefly by her Honour early in the judgment, by reference to the similarities which the Crown had identified in point form (a) to (p), in its submissions. Relevantly, they were said to be as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Although the charges alleged against the accused occurred at different times over this 11 year period they have a common thread involving the following similarities: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) The 4 boys were all students at [named school] 
         
        
        
         
         (b) They were all young, aged between 12 and 14 years; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) The accused was working as a gym teacher at the school; 
         
        
        
         
         (d) All involved penis play; 
         
        
        
         
         (e) All occurred when the boys were in their school uniforms or gym clothes; 
         
        
        
         
         (f) Two occasions (GDR para 10 onwards and JPMCR para 11) occurred whilst the accused supported the boys on gym equipment and he touched them on the crotch; 
         
        
        
         
         (g) Three occasions (SAL,MHS and JPMcF) the approaches were made to the boys in the privacy of the sports room or his office (which is located in the sports room); 
         
        
        
         
         (h)  
         Three occasions (SAL, MHS and JPMcF) each boy was grabbed from behind 
         ; 
         
        
        
         
         (h) Three occasions the accused inserted his hand both inside their pants and underpants (SAL para 8, MMS para 20 and JPMcF para 12); 
         
        
         
        
         
         (i) Three occasions each boy was restrained in the use of his hands (GDR’s wrists were strapped to the high bar para 11, JPMcF hands on the parallel bar para 11, SAL had his hands held by the accused behind his back para 7); 
         
        
        
         
         (k) With all boys he watched them shower whilst they were naked (GDB para 9; SAL para 2); 
         
        
        
         
         (l) With two boys he playfully slapped them on the bottom (GDG and MMS para 18); 
         
        
        
         
         (m) With two boys he spoke about sexual matters – with MMS he spoke about “wanking”, penis size, a woman ‘getting wet’ during sex and foreskin para 14 and 15; he asked JPMcF whether pictures of Samantha Fox gave him an erection para 10; 
         
        
        
         
         (n) Three boys were ones who had difficulties at school – GDG had problems at school and learning difficulties (petit mal epilepsy p. 27 committal; and misbehaved in mid 1991 called another boy’s sister a slut and disciplined by the accused p. 25); MMS was bullied by other students at the school (para 6); JPMcF’s parents were separated and got into trouble with the deputy School Principal for having pornographic magazines; 
         
        
        
         
         (o) those same three boys he gave special attention or told them they were special; 
         
        
        
         
         (p) SAL was summonsed from Economics Class (para 6); GDG was told “Mr F wants you over at the high bar” (p. 28)” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     21 Although, on the face of the reasons for judgment, there are suggestions that the threshold question of admissibility was determined by reference to coincidence, it does seem that the evidence was also considered to qualify by reference to tendency. These are of course separate considerations, and any direction to the jury would need to reflect the differences which arise. 
      
       
     22 It was necessary for her Honour to give careful consideration, so far as the Crown placed reliance on s 97 of the Evidence Act, to whether or not the conduct alleged by the various complainants was capable of showing that he had a tendency (or propensity) to touch boys on the penis without their consent and had the particular state of mind necessary to make that act one of indecent assault. If it had that character then before it was admissible, the Crown still had to show that it had a “significant probative value” (s 97(1)(c)) – an expression which has been held to mean that the evidence must be more than merely relevant, and to be “important” or “of consequence” (R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457). Its significance, it has been held, depends upon the nature of the fact in issue to which the evidence is relevant, - here whether the respondent did touch the complainants on the penis either inside or outside their shorts in circumstances amounting to an indecent assault – and upon the significance which the evidence may have in establishing that fact: R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356. 
      
       
     23 Since the evidence was, in this case, to be tendered by the Crown, it was also necessary that it be shown to have passed through the s 101(2) threshold – i.e. that its probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it might have had on the respondent. The combined effect of s 97(1)(b) and s 101(2) was held in Lock to require an application of the same test as that approved in Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 481 to 483, and in Hoch v The Queen at 295, namely that the evidence bears no reasonable explanation other than the happening of the event or events in issue. (See also BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275 and KRM v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 550).  
      
       
     24 In Regina v OGD (No 2) [2000] NSWCCA 404, it was held that, if the Crown failed to exclude the reasonable possibility of concoction on the part of the proposed witness or witnesses, the evidence must be excluded, not because of the rule in Hoch, but because of the requirement in s 101(2) of the Evidence Act: see also Regina v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261 at para 107 to 111. 
      
       
     25 Independently of this provision, the question of admissibility also calls for a consideration of ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act, as to the exercise of which, Hoch was held in OGD (No 2) to provide a guide.  
      
       
     26 So far as the Crown relied on s 98 of the Evidence Act, it had to establish first that the acts alleged by the complainants were “related events”, i.e. that they were “substantially and relevantly similar, and that the circumstances in which they occurred were substantially similar” (s 98(2)). Next, it had to meet the requirements noted in relation to the tendency evidence, namely, that the evidence would have ”significant probative value” (s 98(1)(b), and that its “probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect which it may have had on the respondent” (s 101(2) – that is, the prejudice associated with the risk of the tribunal of fact using the evidence inappropriately: Regina v Lockyer at 460 and Regina v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261 at para 97). Once these requirements were met then the evidence would be admissible to prove that, “because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally,” the respondent did the act alleged in any given count and/or that he had the particular state of mind alleged in relation to it, for example to rebut any defence of accident (Thompson v The Queen (1989) 169 CLR 1). 
      
       
     27 In Pfennig it was held that it was not necessary, under this provision, to speak in terms of a “striking similarity”, or “underlying unity” or other similar description previously employed in decisions depending upon the admissibility of similar fact evidence at common law, the test being one of substantial and relevant similarity. 
      
       
     28 However, for all practical purposes, questions of admissibility under this heading are likely to be determined by similar considerations to those applied at common law, in that it would be necessary to show that: 
      
       
        
       (a) the existence of the related acts was not open to an innocent explanation such as mere coincidence; 
        
        
       (b) there was no reasonable possibility of the evidence being concocted:  
       Regina v ACK 
       , NSWCCA 22 April 1996; and  
        
        
       (c) the objective improbability of the evidence having an innocent explanation was such that there was no reasonable view of it other than as supporting an inference that the accused was guilty of the relevant act charged ( 
       Pfennig 
       ). 
        
       
     29 Residual questions would similarly arise for consideration in relation to ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
     30 Although somewhat scant consideration was given, in the reasons for judgment, as to whether the evidence of the complainants qualified as tendency evidence, or as coincidence evidence, the focus of attention having been on the issue of concoction, there is nothing in the reasons for judgment to suggest that Hock J misunderstood the relevant principles, or to suggest that she failed to give consideration to the provisions embodied in s 97(2)(b), s 98(1)(b), s 101(2), or s 137. 
      
       
     31 A consideration of the application of these principles to the present case requires a brief mention of the evidence which the various complainants could give, as drawn from their statements and from the evidence given on the voir dire: 
      
       
        
       (a)  
       SAL 
        
       (i) In 1980 SAL was aged 13 years, and was a student of the respondent for gymnastics at the school where the latter taught, and where the other complainants were students. 
        
         
          
           
             
           
          
         
        
       (ii) Early in that year (when he was in Year 8) SAL was called by the respondent to the sports room at the school. 
        
        
       (iii) Once there, the respondent offered to show SAL “ 
       a trick 
       ” and asked him to lock his hands behind his back, whereupon the respondent walked behind him, held his hands firmly with his left hand, placed his right hand inside his trousers and underpants and fondled his penis. 
        
        
       (iv) SAL made an oblique reference to this event in a conversation with his mother during his final year at school in about 1985, and informed his wife of what had occurred in 1991. 
        
        
       (v) After reading the article in the local newspaper of 15 September 1998, which had mentioned that the respondent had been charged with other offences, SAL went to the police himself. 
        
        
       (vi) SAL recalled that the respondent used to watch boys, including himself, showering naked after sports activities. 
        
        
       (vii) SAL had not known any of the other complainants before speaking to the police, and had not spoken to any other boys about he respondent’s behaviour. 
        
        
       (b)  
       MHS 
        
        
       (i) In 1984, MHS was aged 12 to 13 years, and was also a student of the respondent at gymnastics, at the same school as the other complainants. 
        
        
       (ii) MHS had been the victim of bullying, and had received help from the respondent, with whom he discussed his problems, in the respondent’s office next to the gymnasium – discussions which at times turned to sexual matters. 
        
        
       (iii) Midway through 1984, in the course of one such discussion in the respondent’s office (when MHS was in Year 7), the respondent placed his right hand inside MHS’s pants and played with his penis inside his underwear. 
        
        
       (iv) The respondent touched MHS in this way on a number of subsequent occasions while he was in Year 7. 
        
        
       (v) MHS recalled that the respondent used to watch boys, including himself, showering naked after sports activities, and also recalled being slapped by him on the backside. 
        
        
       (vi) In 1986 MHS told his brother of the incident, and a short time later also mentioned it to his parents. 
        
        
       (vii) MHS spoke to police about it in late 1997 and in April 1998 made a statement. 
        
        
       (viii) When MHS was in Year 7, he had heard boys in Year 10 saying the respondent was a bit dodgy: and in Year 8 he had heard some conversation between boys in relation to the respondent’s presence in the shower block. 
        
        
       (ix) MHS did not know any of the other complainants at the time when he first made a complaint. 
        
        
       (x) MHS had spoken to another former pupil MB about the matter shortly after going to the police, and had been informed by MB that it might be worth speaking to JPMcF as he had been heavily involved in the gymnasium. 
        
        
       (xi) MHS had not however spoken to JPMcF himself. 
        
        
       (c)  
       JPMcF 
        
        
       (i) In 1985, JPMcF was aged 12 years, and was a student of the respondent in gymnastics, at the same school as the other complainants. 
        
        
       (ii) In 1984 or 1985 (Year 7 or 8) JPMcF was disciplined for the possession of some pornographic magazines, after which he was spoken to by the respondent in relation to that material and in relation to sexual matters of a wider and more intrusive kind. 
        
        
       (iii) In 1985 the respondent touched JPMcF on the crotch outside his clothing, on several occasions, while supporting or assisting him as he worked out in the gymnasium on parallel bars, or as he did somersaults. 
        
        
       (iv) From time to time in 1985/1986 the respondent followed JPMcF into the storeroom of the gymnasium of a stadium outside the school where he conducted extra gymnastic tuition. On several occasions in that room he placed his hand inside the clothing of JPMcF and fondled his penis. 
        
        
       (v) JPMcF was informed by GDB that he had been indecently touched by the respondent. 
        
        
       (vi) JPMCF was approached by police in July 1998, at which time he informed them of what had happened to him. 
        
        
       (vii) JPMcF had not spoken to SAL or MHS about the matter, nor had he spoken to the other former student MB (to whom MHS had spoken). 
        
        
       (viii) JPMcF had worked for the respondent, for about 8 years, as a gymnastics coach or assistant in the private business of the latter, after he had left school, but gave up that position when learning that other boys may have been assaulted by him. 
        
        
       (d)  
       GDG 
        
        
       (i) In 1991, GDG was aged 14 years and was a student of the respondent in gymnastics at the same school as the other complainants. 
        
        
       (ii) In that year, GDG was working out on a high bar in the gymnasium in a hall adjoining the school, which was also used by the respondent, in an exercise which required his hands to be secured by safety straps. While engaged in this exercise the respondent put his hand on GDG’s penis, from outside his clothing, and squeezed it two or three times. 
        
        
       (iii) GDG was very angry and ran out of the hall; on seeing JPMcF who was working as an assistant coach, he informed him of what had occurred. JPMcF indicated that there had been other similar incidents. 
        
        
       (iv) On the night of this occurrence, GDG informed his parents of what had happened, and they indicated that they would speak to the Principal. 
        
        
       (v) GDG recalled that the respondent used to watch boys, including himself, showering while naked. On occasions, he said, he was asked by the respondent to pick up a bar of soap from the floor, and was slapped on the backside by him. 
        
        
       (vi) GDG had experienced some disciplinary problems at school, and had discussion with the respondent concerning them. 
        
        
       (vii) In 1998, GDG was shown the newspaper article in the local paper by his mother, and indicated that he would speak to police. 
        
        
       (viii) Later that year, at a time when he was being spoken to by police in relation to some misconduct (not of a sexual nature) of his own, he made mention of them using their time to search for paedophiles, such as the respondent whom he named.  
        
        
       (ix) He followed up this mention by providing a statement to police in January 1999. 
        
        
       (x) GDG had not known any of the other complainants save for JPMcF, and had not spoken to the latter between the time of the incident involving himself, and speaking to police.  
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
         
       
     32 Of some relevance for the issue which arose, particularly under the heading of coincidence, is the evidence, which it is anticipated, would be given by the mother of GDG, in relation to a meeting between her husband and herself with the school principal and the respondent, on the day after the complaint. When informed of the matter of concern, she said, in her statement, that the respondent indicated that sometimes he had to touch the bodies of the boys during exercises, and that he was a “hands on” person. From this material, and from the evidence given in the first trial, it might reasonably be expected that a “defence” or issue of accidental touching might well arise. 
      
       
     33 Additionally of relevance, in relation to the possibility of concoction is the fact that the complainants were of different ages, had been in different classes at school, and had no reason to socialize together or to share friends. The position may be summarised as follows:

     34 Of some relevance additionally was the evidence which the other pupil, MB, gave to the effect that MHS had spoken to him before the newspaper article, asking whether he knew of anyone else who had been assaulted by the respondent, to which he replied that he did not, but suggested that it would be worth getting into contact with JPMcF, because he had spent a lot of time in the respondent’s office. As emerged from the evidence of former Detective Sergent Spence, he had approached JPMcF after he had been given his name by MHS. 
      
       
     35 It was also established that the complainant MSF, in the trial which had resulted in a directed acquittal, had made complaints to other children (who were older than the present complainants) about the conduct of the respondent during 1977, had left the school in 1980, and had been born on 27 March 1963 (or possibly 1965 - the transcript being somewhat equivocal in this regard).  
      
       
     36 A starting point for consideration of the question which arises is the proposition well established on the authorities, that sexual offences should not be tried together unless the evidence on one count is properly admissible to prove another: Sutton v The Queen (1984) 152 CLR 528 and De Jesus v The Queen (1986) 61 ALJR 1. 
      
       
     37 That principle needs to be understood in the light of the further proposition that in order for the evidence to be admissible, it must be shown first to be relevant to a fact in issue (Smith v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 1398), secondly to conform with the requirements of ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act, and thirdly not be such as to warrant exclusion under sections 101, 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
     38 In relation to relevance, Mr Byrne SC accepted that the question whether evidence that a school teacher had committed a sexual assault upon one student could rationally affect the assessment of the probability that he had committed a sexual assault upon another student, depended on the circumstances. That was, in my view, a correct concession. I do not however accept the associated submission that the facts in this case required that question to be answered in the negative. 
      
       
     39 Where, as here, there was evidence as to the differences in ages and classes of the complainants, as to the fact that with one exception they had not known or spoken to one another, and where there was an absence of evidence suggesting shared or common knowledge of the respondent’s suggested tendency or propensity towards young pupils, the evidence in my view did have a clear relevance for the reason noted by Gleeson CJ in Regina v ACK, NSWCCA 22 April 1996 at page 5, and within the meaning of the Evidence Act (s 55) as rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the fact in issue: see Regina v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 709. The mere possibility of gossip occurring among school boys was insufficient to require any different conclusion. Moreover, as Gaudron J observed in BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275 at 299, evidence of conduct on other occasions can have special probative force in relation to the possibility of any one complainant concocting his or her account if there are particular, (or, I would add, common) features which render it improbable that two or more persons would give such accounts if the conduct alleged had not, in fact, occurred.  
      
       
     40 The next question for determination is whether there was a sufficient similarity in the conduct alleged, and in the circumstances in which it occurred, so as to be capable of showing that: 
      
       
        
       (a) the respondent had a tendency to touch or fondle the penises of young boys in their first or second years of high school, with the state of mind that would convert such a non-consensual act into one amounting at law to an indecent assault; and/or 
        
        
       (b) the improbability of the events described occurring as a matter of coincidence or chance was such that the individual acts, which were alleged by each complainant, had occurred in fact and with the state of mind required at law for an indecent assault. 
        
       
     41 In this regard the Crown asserted that the various similarities which her Honour had identified, by reference to paragraphs (a) to (p) of the submissions presented to Judge Hock, did have this quality. Additionally it asserted that they revealed a modus operandi involving conduct directed toward young boys at the school where he taught, who had a vulnerability, who had come into the respondent’s reach as his students, and who were indecently assaulted by him within the facilities available to him, either at the school, or at the adjoining premises which he used for his gymnastic teaching activities: Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106 at 112 per Gaudron J, and 134 per McHugh and Hayne JJ; and Regina v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261, at para 93. 
      
       
     42 Mr Byrne SC however, submitted that the similarities which were relied upon by the Crown, going both to the acts and the circumstances in which they were said to have occurred, were artificial. In essence this relied upon the proposition that there are only a limited number of ways in which a boy can be indecently assaulted, and that as a result there is no significant similarity in the fact that each complainant said that he had been touched on the penis, inside or outside their clothing, or that it had occurred in one or other of the rooms used by the respondent in the course of his duties as a teacher in gymnastics. 
      
       
     43 Reference was made to the decision in Regina v T, where the decision of the trial judge was: 
      
       
        
       (a) affirmed in relation to the four children who alleged that the accused had brought his penis into contact with them while they were sitting on the floor reading; 
        
        
       (b) reversed in relation to the other two complainants, one of whom said that his penis had been touched after he was instructed to lower his pants so that he could be examined for spots; and the other of whom said that his penis had been touched while he was sitting on the lap of the accused. 
        
       
     44 Lee CJ at CL said (at p 6) that the incidents in this second group lacked “the essential probative impact which was necessary”, observing that “they amount, in my view, to no more than a description of two different incidents in both of which the appellant touched a boy on the penis. It may have been different if there had been several such incidents for the question of whether there are similar facts is in many respects one of degree” (Emphasis added). 
      
       
     45 The final sentence in this passage is of importance, and in my view carries the day for the Crown in this case. While there are some individual differences in detail, it does not seem to me to matter whether the incident alleged occurred in the same room or in one of the several rooms used by the respondent. Substantially they were similar locations being his place of work in connection with his teaching activities. 
      
       
     46 Moreover, I do not consider it fatal that not all of the acts alleged occurred during a gymnastic exercise, as distinct from arising in the course of the boys being in the immediate control of the respondent in connection which his teaching duties. While this fact caused me to reflect carefully on this aspect of the case, the number and coincidences of the acts and dealings otherwise alleged satisfies me that this case falls on the other side of the line to that examined in relation to the second group of cases in Regina v T. 
      
       
     47 Subject to any question of concoction, the relevance requirement for admissibility was clearly established. I see no room for error in her Honour’s findings that the evidence was relevant to the fact in issue in relation to each complainant; that it had a probative value of significance or importance; and that such probative value was of sufficient weight to outweigh any prejudicial effect which it may have had on the respondent. In that regard it had a particular relevance in relation to the question whether the touching had been accidental or deliberate, and whether it was of a sexual nature or one occurring in the proper discharge of the duties of a gymnastic instructor supervising exercises of boys in circumstances which can lead to injuries: Lockyer  at 459. 
      
       
     48 The remaining issue concerns that of concoction, that is, whether there was a “real chance” or a “real danger” of that providing an explanation for the coincidence of accounts of any one or more of the complainants (per Brennan and Dawson JJ in Hoch at 299, 300 and 302) or whether a coincidence of account was “reasonably explicable” on the basis, for example, that there was a sufficient relationship between the complainants or an opportunity or motive for concoction (per Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ at 297). The relevant test which was proposed in Regina v Colby calls for the identification of a “reasonable possibility as distinct from a speculative or conjectural one”; and it was a test where the onus rested upon the Crown, to negative that possibility: Regina v OGD (No 2) at p 447. 
      
       
     49 I am unable to see any error in relation to her Honour’s assessment of this aspect of the case. Having regard to the absence of contact between GDB, MHS and SAL, the differences in their ages, and the classes which they attended, as well as the sequence of disclosure by them, I am unable to see that there is any reasonable possibility of concoction. The suggestion that there may have been gossip which they could not recall, was somewhat thin and largely a matter of conjecture or speculation and each had made a first complaint before the newspaper article was published. Moreover, there was no basis in the evidence, presented during the voir dire inquiry, to suggest that any one of them had a financial motive, or a grudge against the school or the respondent, or any antipathy to the latter before the events alleged. Any resentment or anger on their part subsequently, attributable to the act alleged, would be understandable and would not provide any basis for assuming concoction. To so suggest would be circular. 
      
       
     50 The present case is accordingly not of the genus noted by Gaudron J in BRS v The Queen (1997) at 300–301 involving concoction where a complainant has possibly manufactured an account after becoming aware of a like event or like allegation involving the accused or has been infected by discussions by others concerning him – per Lee CJ at CL in Regina v T at p 4. Nor is it a case where there was any evidence of joint concoction. 
      
       
     51 Mr Byrne SC however, sought to make some capital out of the evidence, from the mother of SAL, to the effect that she recalled friends talking about the respondent “indecently touching kids at school”, at some time while she thought he was in Year 11 at another school. SAL had no recollection of any such conversation, and found it hard to believe, although there was evidence to the effect that he had told his mother in 1984 that the respondent was a paedophile, without going into any further detail. Additionally, there was evidence that, before this conversation, that is on the day following the alleged assault, SAL had returned home from school with wet trousers because he had taken to showering in his underpants to avoid the attention of F in the shower block – an event partially corroborating his evidence. 
      
       
     52 He similarly sought to make capital out of MHS’ recollection of overhearing Year 10 boys referring to the respondent as “a bit dodgy” – although there was no suggestion put to him that, he had attached any particular sexual connotation to that comment.  
      
       
     53 It is true that neither of these matters was mentioned by her Honour. However, when considered in their full context, and in particular absent any greater specificity in the suggested “gossip” I am not persuaded that they justify any different conclusion from that which she reached.  
      
       
     54 In relation to JPMcF, there was the fact of the earlier disclosure by GDB to him, and there was additionally the fact that his first complaint followed the newspaper article. There was no specific suggestion of antipathy or annoyance on his part beyond any resentment arising out of the acts alleged, particularly in circumstances where he had worked for the respondent for some years following the events alleged. However, as her Honour found, the other circumstances mentioned did give rise to a reasonable possibility of concoction on his part. I am not persuaded that error was shown in this regard. 
      
       
        
       ORDERS 
        
       
     55 It would follow from the foregoing that the admissibility ruling has not been shown to have been erroneous, with the consequences which I have mentioned in relation to the course which the trial of the respondent should follow. I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1. Crown appeal dismissed. 
        
        
       2. Leave to appeal granted to respondent, but appeal dismissed. 
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     56 BELL J: I have read the draft judgment of Wood CJ at CL. I agree with the orders proposed for the reasons which his Honour gives.

      70209/01 R v Stanley Joseph LAMB 
       
      70066/01 R v Edward George THURSTON 
       
       
      JUDGMENT –  
      Re proposed transactional evidence; see T 327 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The Crown has sought to tender evidence along the lines of the statements contained in Exhibit P on the voir dire tending to show that some hours prior to the death of the deceased the accused Lamb was drinking, was in company with the accused Thurston, and was in an aggressive mood, including a mood of physical aggression, and some of the evidence was to the effect that the accused Thurston was attempting to restrain the accused Lamb. 
     
      
    2 I indicated that I would admit specified parts of such evidence and give my reasons later. Mr Parker on behalf of the accused Thurston then submitted that I should admit the balance because in his submission it was all part of the same transaction, and showed the degree of the drinking and aggression on the part of the accused Lamb, and he submitted that it could not really be separated from what I had indicated I would admit. 
     
      
    3 The parts that I admitted on the application of the Crown was evidence of drinking during the day by either of the accused, evidence of verbal and physical aggression by the accused Lamb towards a person by the name of Anthony Slater and any form of aggression on the part of the accused Lamb after 7 pm; also evidence that Lamb was in the company of Thurston during the day and apparent efforts by the accused Thurston to restrain Lamb. 
     
      
    4 The evidence is not tendency evidence within s 70 of the Evidence Act 1995, nor is it tendered or admitted on such basis. In O'Leary v The King (1946) 73 CLR 566 at 577-8, Dixon CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Without evidence of what, during that time, was done by those men who took any significant part in the matter and especially evidence of the behaviour of the prisoner, the transaction of which the alleged murder formed an integral part could not be truly understood and, isolated from it, could only be presented as an unreal and not very intelligible event. The prisoner's generally violent and hostile conduct might well serve to explain his mind and attitude and, therefore, to implicate him in the resulting homicide."" 
        
       
      
    5 That case was a case where the evidence related to what was described as a ""drunken orgy"" which commenced on the Saturday morning and continued until late on the Saturday night, during which the accused, at various times, assaulted a number of fellow employees, some of the assaults were unprovoked and all consisted of brutal blows to the head, including one allegation that he had, during the afternoon, aimed a blow at the deceased. 
     
      
    6 The matter was also referred to by Latham CJ at 575 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “All the assaults in question were incidents of a drunken orgy on the same day, began at Penola, continued at Kalangadoo at the camp where the men lived. Evidence that the accused had been drinking during the day and evening of 6th July and the early hours of 7th July, was admissible to show the probability that he would attack another man in a fit of drunken fury. Evidence that, on the day and the night of the killing of [the deceased], he actually attacked particular fellow employees without cause is also evidence which goes to show the probability that he would attack some other fellow employee. Such evidence puts the act of attacking [the deceased] in a setting which makes it possible for the jury to obtain a real appreciation of the events of the day and the night. It is evidence of “facts and matters which form constituent part or ingredients of the transaction itself or explain or make intelligible the course of conduct pursued”.” 
        
       
      
    7 The Crown pressed the evidence on this basis which might conveniently be described as evidence of a connected series of events and also as evidence tending to show the state of mind of the accused Lamb at a time sufficiently approximate to the time that the deceased was killed. Most of the evidence relates to events from about 7 pm onwards, the deceased apparently being killed between 8.30 and 10 pm. 
     
      
    8 None of the witnesses in the Crown case, as I understand it, will say that they actually saw either accused kill the deceased. 
     
      
    9 It is therefore a circumstantial case and consequently all relevant circumstances if they could rationally, directly or indirectly, affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue are relevant (s 55) and, unless otherwise excluded, admissible (s 56). 
     
      
    10 The association of the two accused that day is clearly a relevant circumstance, as is the fact that they were drinking and how much they were drinking. 
     
      
    11 Likewise, the state of mind of the accused shortly before or shortly after the relevant time is relevant, particularly if he was displaying a hostile and aggressive attitude and that the aggression included threats of physical violence. 
     
      
    12 It is also relevant to the accused Thurston's case, if it be supported by evidence, that Thurston was trying to restrain the accused Lamb. See generally R v Adam [1999] NSWCCA 189 at [23] to [25], R v Player [2000] NSWCCA 123 at [10] to [16]. 
     
      
    13 True it is that the violence was not directed towards the deceased, but neither was a lot of the violence in O'Leary's case; and that of itself does not make it irrelevant. It merely takes it out of the category of relationship evidence (cf Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334) and into the field of transactional evidence, which includes evidence of surrounding circumstances part of the same connected series of events and completeness; and it also tends to show the accused's state of mind at the relevant time. 
     
      
    14 For these reasons I indicated that I would admit those parts of the evidence which I admitted yesterday. 
     
      
    15 Mr Parker then asks me to go further and admit the evidence of the verbal arguments with other people earlier in the day and the fact that they included, as I understand it, one threat of violence offered to a Mr French and the fact that because of the arguments they were asked to leave a number of places. 
     
      
    16 I have already ruled that the evidence of the drinking earlier goes to an examination of the total quantity that the accused may have consumed during the day. 
     
      
    17 On further consideration of the evidence, it seems to me that the matters alleged earlier in the day to which I have referred, is really all part of a developing situation which started with the drinking and developed into verbal arguments and later threats by the accused Lamb, in particular of physical violence. They are all, it seems to me, part of the same developing situation or transaction. 
     
      
    18 I appreciate that often this must be a question of degree and the dividing line in many cases will be arbitrary, but in this case I am satisfied that it is all part of the same developing pattern and helps to put the circumstances that further developed and occurred later that night into context and may help the jury to understand it. 
     
      
    19 I have considered whether it would be unfairly prejudicial to the accused Lamb, but having regard to s 137, I am satisfied that it does have probative value and that, although prejudicial to the accused Lamb, it is not unfairly prejudicial to him and the probative value is not outweighed by any unfair prejudice. 
     
      
    20 Therefore, I will not exclude the evidence pursuant to s 137 and I will not exercise the discretion to exclude it under s 135. 
     
      
    21 Accordingly I admit the whole of the evidence.

     2 GREG JAMES J: I agree with Kirby J. 
      
       
     3 KIRBY J: Terrence James Fuller (the appellant) stood trial before Garling DCJ and a Jury in October 2000 charged with various sexual offences. The charges were based upon allegations by Ms Julie Donnelly. Ms Donnelly told police in February 2000 that at various times between 1984 and 1987 (when she was between 12 and 15 years old) the appellant had sexual intercourse with her, without her consent. 
      
       
     4 The charges related to the incidents identified by the complainant, and with one exception (count 8), were framed in the alternative. Counts 1 to 7 alleged sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of 16 years (s61D(1) Crimes Act, 1900). Counts 1A to 7A alleged, in the alternative, unlawful carnal knowledge with a person under the age of 16 years (s71 Crimes Act, 1900). 
      
       
     5 When Ms Donnelly gave evidence, she did not refer to the incident which was said to give rise to counts 7 and 7A. A verdict was directed in respect of those counts. Thirteen counts remained, and went to the jury. The appellant was acquitted on all counts except count 6A. The terms of that charge were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""(6A) In the alternative that he in the months of June or July 1986 at Kempsey in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with Julie Anne Donnelly she then being 14 or 15 years old."" 
         
        
        
       The appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal 
        
       
     6 An appeal was lodged to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Notice of Appeal raised two issues: 
      
       
     · First, were the verdicts inconsistent? 
      
       
     · Secondly, was the trial Judge's direction on the delay in making a complaint adequate? 
      
       
     7 The matter came before the Court on 26 September 2001 (Heydon JA, Wood CJ at CL and Carruthers AJ). Mr Segal of counsel, appearing for Mr Fuller, foreshadowed an application for an adjournment. The transcript on appeal is a précis of what was said. According to that précis, the Court was told the following: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Mr Segal advised that in June or July at Glen Innes prison a woman by the name of Gloria Rudder, a Kempsey local, who knew the parties, came to visit the appellant and told him that it had been reported to her that Julie, the complain(ant) in these proceedings, had conversations with two other people, namely Kathy Donnelly, some sort of distant cousin, and Donna Rudder, to the effect that prior to going to the police the complainant had said, what the appellant believed, were words to the effect, 'I'm going to make false complaints against the appellant in order to get money.' The appellant further believed the complainant said to Kathy Donnelly and Donna Rudder words to the effect Lynette Donnelly and the complainant had put their heads together to invent a false story. 
         
        
        
         
         Therefore, submitted Mr Segal, there was fresh and knew (sic) evidence. Further, the appellant says that the complainant asked Kathy Donnelly to lie about evidence which never existed."" 
         
        
       
     8 The Court determined that it would deal with the two grounds raised in the Notice of Appeal, preserving the appellant's rights to pursue the matters foreshadowed by Mr Segal. The Court then heard argument. It unanimously dismissed the appeal in relation to the grounds set out above (R v Fuller [2001] NSWCCA 390). 
      
       
        
       The fresh Notice of Appeal 
        
       
     9 An Amended Notice of Appeal was lodged. In substance it raises two issues: 
      
       
     · First, that there was a conversation between the complainant and Ms Debbie Rudder which is fresh evidence, the absence of which at the trial deprived the appellant of a significant possibility of acquittal. 
      
       
     · Secondly, that the appellant was also deprived of the opportunity of raising good character. Certain other charges alleging sexual misconduct were then pending against him. After the trial, no evidence was offered on the other charges and the appellant was acquitted in respect of those charges. 
      
       
        
       Ground 1: Fresh evidence 
        
       
     10 In view of the serious nature of the allegations made on behalf of the appellant to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions wrote to Det Snr Const Rutledge, the police officer in charge of the investigation. Det Rutledge was provided with an outline of what had been said to the Court, and asked to obtain statements. He interviewed Ms Debbie Rudder, the daughter of Mrs Gloria Rudder, one of the persons said to have been the source of the statements passed on to the appellant. Det Rutledge made a note of his conversation with Ms Rudder. The note, relevantly, is in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         ""'Julie Donnelly phoned me up at Willawarrin at home. It was around the time that 'Buster' Donnelly had made a complaint to the police about Terry Fuller.' I said 'Was there any conversation about her making a false statement about Terry?' She said, 'There was just a general conversation. She spoke about 'Darly' (Lynette Donnelly), accusing Terry of sleeping with Julie. Julie said that she had slept with Terry. She said that 'Darly' had been accusing her of it, but she didn't care. She didn't say anything about making a false accusation to the police. She was just voicing her opinion about it.' I said, 'Was there any mention of money?' She said, 'She mentioned what she could get out of it, she would get out of it. She didn't mention money. She may have meant satisfaction.'"" 
         
        
       
     11 The police also obtained a statement from Mrs Gloria Rudder. Mrs Rudder confirmed that she had visited the appellant at the Glen Innes Correctional Centre in June 2001. Others present during the visit included Mr Clifford Fuller, referred to as ""Buzz"". According to Mrs Gloria Rudder, ""Buzz"" made the following statement to the appellant in her presence (referring to Debbie Rudder, her daughter): 
      
       
        
         
         ""'Debbie has told me that she has had a phone call from Julie Donnelly and the phone call was before you were charged. The reason that she slept with Terry, was to get back at Lynette because she was sick and tired of Lynette accusing her of having an affair all those years.' That was what I remember of the conversation."" 
         
        
       
     12 Mrs Gloria Rudder denied that her daughter had claimed that Ms Julie Donnelly said that she and Lynette Donnelly would invent a false story to get money from the appellant. 
      
       
     13 The solicitors for the appellant also filed a number of affidavits. They included an affidavit of Ms Debbie Rudder of 21 December 2001, which is in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. That I am 30 years of age and am the 2nd cousin of Julie Donnelly, the complainant in the sexual assault allegations against Terry Fuller. I have known Julie Donnelly for many years. 
         
        
        
         
         2. I recall that before Terry Fuller was charged by the police in relation to those allegations I spoke to Julie on the telephone. This was about 2 to 3 years ago and it was before Terry had been charged by the police. 
         
        
        
         
         3. In that conversation, the subject of Terry Fuller and Darly was mentioned. Darly is Lynette Donnelly. It came up in general conversation. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Julie said to me in that conversation quote 'I am sick and tired of Darly accusing me of having an affair with Terry, so I did have sex with Terry and slept with him to spite Darly.' 
         
        
        
         
         5. Julie also said in the same conversation quote 'I am going to get all I can get out of it.'"" 
         
        
       
     14 The appellant acknowledged that the evidence put forward as ""fresh evidence"" falls far short of that foreshadowed on 26 September 2001 to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Should this Court, nonetheless, receive this material as ""fresh evidence""? 
      
       
        
       The test for fresh evidence 
        
       
     15 In determining whether fresh evidence should be received on appeal, the fundamental question is whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred (Gallagher v The Queen (1985-86) 160 CLR 392 per Gibbs CJ, at 395; Mickelberg v The Queen (1988-89) 167 CLR 259, per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301-302). What must be established is that the absence of the evidence at the trial led to a miscarriage of justice. There will be a miscarriage where there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant if the new evidence had been before it at the trial (Gallagher (supra) Gibbs CJ at 399, Mason and Deane JJ at 402). In Mickelberg (supra) Toohey and Gaudron JJ expressed the principle in these terms: (at 301) 
      
       
        
         
         ""In essence, the fresh evidence must be such that, when viewed in combination with the evidence given at trial, it can be said that the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused if all the evidence had been before it ( 
         Gallagher 
         ,  
         per Brennan J at p410) or, if there be a practical difference, that there is 'a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the (accused).'"" 
         
        
       
     16 Gibbs CJ in Gallagher (supra) identified three considerations which will guide a Court in deciding whether there has been a miscarriage (at 395/6). First, there is an issue whether the evidence could, with reasonable diligence, have been produced by the accused at the trial. That is not an inflexible requirement, especially in circumstances where, as here, the investigation by the appellant is made the more difficult by reason of significant delay in making a complaint. Secondly, the evidence sought to be adduced must be ""credible"", ""cogent"", ""relevant"", ""plausible"", or at least capable of belief (Gallagher (supra) Gibbs CJ at 395; Mickelberg (supra) Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301). Thirdly, if the evidence is credible, and accepted, might it reasonably have led the jury to return a different verdict? 
      
       
        
       The Crown case against the appellant 
        
       
     17 The Court of Criminal Appeal, in dealing with the previous issues, set out at some length the transcript relevant to counts 6 and 6A (R v Fuller (supra) pages 1 to 15). The appellant was, between 1984 and 1987, the defacto husband of Ms Lynette Donnelly (also known as ""Darly""). Ms Lynette Donnelly had a sister, Karen Murray. The complainant, Julie Donnelly, was the daughter of Ms Karen Murray. The sisters lived near each other in the same street. From time to time Ms Julie Donnelly (the complainant) slept at her aunt's home on a mattress in the lounge room. She said that she had done so on a particular occasion when she was 14 or 15 years old. She went to sleep at about 10.00 pm. She woke to find the appellant on top of her. It was still dark. However, there was some light from the television. Her nightie had been pulled up and her ""knickers"" pulled down. According to the complainant, the appellant forced her legs apart. He placed his hand over her mouth. He then had sexual intercourse for about five minutes. Whilst that was taking place her aunt, Ms Lynette Donnelly, walked in. The complainant's description of what then occurred was in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         ""A. Yeah while he was still on top of me, I seen the light come on and heard the door open and my aunty was standing in the doorway and she just straight away attacked him, like 'what are you doing?' 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you say what happened? 
          
         A. She asked him what he was doing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In what sort of voice did she say that? 
          
         A. She was angry, she knew straight away what was going on, what had happened, she was calling him names, she smacked his face."" 
         
        
       
     18 She added: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. When you saw the light go on, where was he? 
          
         A. Still on top of me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had he taken his penis out of your vagina at that time? 
          
         A. He jumped off really quickly once he realised my aunty was standing in the doorway and told her he was just talking to me."" 
         
        
       
     19 A short time later, the complainant's step-father arrived and took her home. 
      
       
     20 Ms Lynette Donnelly gave evidence in similar terms. She said this: 
      
       
        
         
         ""A. I woke up around 4.30 and Terry wasn't in the bed so I thought I'd go and have a look for him and I walked from the main bedroom through the hall to the lounge room and the lounge room door was closed and I opened it and the lounge room was in darkness so I turned the light on. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did you see? 
          
         A. I saw Terrence lying on top of Julie, between her legs, with no clothes on. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who had no clothes on? 
          
         A. Terrence had no clothes on. He had, when he stood up his underpants were hanging at his ankles and Julie was uncovered and she had no clothes on. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you say anything? 
          
         A. I said, 'what do you think you're doing?' He said, 'nuthin' I'm only talking to her' and he repeated his self and I told (him) he was a bastard and I smacked his face."" 
         
        
       
     21 Ms Lynette Donnelly said that she left the house. She went to the home of her sister, the complainant's mother. She told her what she had seen. The complainant's step-father then went to bring the complainant home. 
      
       
     22 Mr John Murray (the step-father) gave evidence. He confirmed that Ms Lynette Donnelly arrived during the night. He was not a party to the conversation which then took place between his wife and her sister. He heard the appellant's name and that of the complainant. He said that he then went to the appellant's home to collect the complainant. 
      
       
     23 The appellant was interviewed by the police. He denied having had sexual intercourse with the complainant, as alleged. He repeated that denial in evidence before the jury. He also denied that his wife, Ms Lynette Donnelly, had walked into the lounge room whilst he was on top of the complainant. He further denied that she had slapped his face. He did recall an occasion when the complainant's step-father, Mr John Murray, had come to the house to collect Julie. It was in 1988 (by which time the complainant was 16). She was in the lounge room in a sleeping bag with his friend, Mr Ian Duffy. He had entered the lounge room, approaching his friend for a cigarette. He was crouched down beside the sleeping bag when his wife, Lynette, entered the room. She asked him what he was doing. She then left the house. It was later that John Murray called and took the complainant home. 
      
       
     24 Mr Ian Duffy gave evidence. He said that he slept with the complainant in 1988, and had intercourse. He recalled the appellant coming into the lounge room whilst he was with the complainant in a sleeping bag. He asked for a cigarette. Mr Fuller's wife, Lynette, entered the room. She said: ""What are you doing down there?"" No-one responded. His wife then left the house. Later the complainant's step-father arrived. The complainant got dressed and left. 
      
       
        
       Was there a miscarriage? 
        
       
     25 Ms Debbie Rudder gave evidence. She was cross examined. Her evidence in some respects lacked detail, and was vague. She, nonetheless, adhered to her account that Ms Julie Donnelly had rung her, and said the words to which she deposed. 
      
       
     26 Ms Julie Donnelly was also called. She gave evidence in a forthright manner. She denied the conversation attributed to her by Ms Rudder. She was not shifted from that position when cross examined. Indeed, she insisted that, notwithstanding the jury verdict, she had been raped by the appellant. 
      
       
     27 Making the assumption, for the purposes of analysis, that the account of Ms Debbie Rudder was not available at the time of trial, and is credible, would that evidence, if accepted, have led the jury to a different verdict? Is there a significant possibility, based upon that evidence, that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant? I do not believe that there is. 
      
       
     28 The Court of Criminal appeal, in dealing with the original grounds of appeal, made the following observations upon the evidence presented at trial: (Heydon JA at para 22) 
      
       
        
         
         ""22. Count 6A required only proof of sexual intercourse. The unshaken testimony of Mrs Donnelly as to the state of undress of the appellant and the complainant, their relative positions, and the rather incredible statement of the appellant that he was only talking to the complainant, may not of itself have proved sexual intercourse beyond a reasonable doubt. But it unquestionably and very powerfully confirmed that part of the complainant's evidence which complained of sexual intercourse, and made it safe to act on it. The trial judge said to the jury in relation to the defence argument that even if Mrs Donnelly's evidence was accepted it did not necessarily indicate sexual intercourse: 'Well that is a matter for you. You have Lynette's evidence that the accused was naked, on top of Julie, who was naked. And it is a matter for you how you deal with that.' It would be strange if the jury had not been satisfied that sexual intercourse had taken place."" 
         
        
       
     29 Heydon JA added: (para 24) 
      
       
        
         
         ""... The Crown evidence on Count 6A did not contain discrepancies, inadequacies, taints or any want of probative force in such a way as to suggest to this Court a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted. ..."" 
         
        
       
     30 Ms Rudder's evidence, if accepted, amounts to an acknowledgement by the complainant of consensual intercourse with the appellant. The conversation, as recounted by her, does not specify when intercourse took place in relation to the dates in the charges. Assuming intercourse occurred in the period covered by the charges, Ms Rudder's evidence, if accepted, would simply take away one aspect of the complainant's account, namely, that what happened was without her consent. That was an aspect rejected by the jury in any event. The accused was found not guilty on Count 6, in which the Crown was obliged to prove the absence of consent. On the other hand, the evidence of Ms Rudder, if accepted, was consistent with the complainant's account that she had sexual intercourse with the appellant. The Crown, in respect of Count 6A, was simply obliged to prove intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years. 
      
       
     31 For the evidence of Ms Rudder to give rise to any possibility of miscarriage in respect of Count 6A, the statement must be read as implying intercourse for the first time at some later date, after the period covered by the indictment. That was a construction urged by the appellant, especially because of the reference to spite. I believe, however, that such a construction is reading altogether too much into the words attributed by Ms Rudder to the complainant. 
      
       
     32 There is a further aspect to Ms Rudder's evidence. She also attributed to the complainant the following words: 
      
       
        
        ""I'm going to get all I can get out of it."" 
        
       
     33 Those words do not, to my mind, suggest that the complainant had therefore provided a false account. They are consistent with someone who has been wronged, and recognised an opportunity to obtain compensation. 
      
       
     34 I do not believe, therefore, that, even accepting the words of Ms Rudder, depriving the jury of such evidence gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. Her account of her conversation with the complainant does not suggest a significant possibility that a jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant, had they known of such evidence. 
      
       
     35 I would reject Ground 1. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2: Character evidence 
        
       
     36 Two sets of charges were preferred against Mr Fuller. He was first charged after allegations by Mr Stephen Donnelly. He was later charged as a consequence of the complaint by Ms Julie Donnelly. An order was made that there should be separate trials, back to back. The charges involving Ms Julie Donnelly would proceed first. These are the matters dealt with in this appeal. The indictment was presented on Monday 9 October 2000. Ms Flannery of counsel appeared for Mr Fuller. Ms Flannery has sworn an affidavit in which she said this: 
      
       
        
         
         ""4. I did not lead evidence of the appellant's good character in the trial ... as I believed the Crown would lead evidence of the outstanding allegations made by Stephen Donnelly."" 
         
        
       
     37 The jury retired to consider its verdict on Thursday 12 October 2000. The same day, the Crown presented the indictment based upon the complaints of Mr Stephen Donnelly. A fresh jury was empanelled. The following day, Friday 13 October 2000, the Crown offered no evidence in support of the indictment. The jury therefore found the appellant not guilty on each count. Later the same day the jury in the first trial returned its verdict. The appellant was convicted in respect of Count 6A. 
      
       
     38 Ms Flannery, in her affidavit, said that, but for the outstanding allegations concerning Mr Stephen Donnelly, she would have raised the good character of the appellant in the trial involving Ms Julie Donnelly. 
      
       
     39 The following submissions are made in these circumstances on behalf of the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The appellant suffered a miscarriage of justice and did not receive a fair trial by virtue of procedural unfairness ..."" 
         
        
       
     40 Counsel added: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is acknowledged that the prosecution may have diverse reasons as to why a matter does not proceed. It is submitted that the injustice to the appellant is that the knowledge that the 'Stephen' matter was not continuing came just after the 'Julie' trial and not before it. The appellant was therefore denied the opportunity to properly consider his position at the time of trial."" 
         
        
       
     41 It is not suggested that the Crown deliberately arranged the order of the trials, knowing that no evidence would be offered in the second trial. The Crown filed an affidavit outlining the circumstances which led to it offering no evidence. The complainant, Stephen Donnelly, said at the end of the first day that he did not believe he could give evidence in front of the jury. He, therefore, did not wish to proceed. 
      
       
     42 The appellant was born on 2 February 1956. He was 44 years old at the time of his trial. He had a conviction for possession of Indian hemp in December 1975. He was placed upon a recognisance for 18 months. He had a further conviction for the same offence in April 1984. He served 100 hours of community service. It was open to the appellant, notwithstanding these convictions, to assert good character ""in a particular respect"" (s110 Evidence Act 1995), namely that he had no convictions for sexual offences. 
      
       
     43 The complaint now made by the appellant was not included in the Notice of Appeal. It was not raised when the appeal on that notice was heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 26 September 2001. It was first identified in the Amended Notice of Appeal of 4 February 2002. Leave is therefore required (Rule 25A Criminal Appeal Rules, 1952). The Crown opposes the granting of leave. Leave should only be given if that is necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     44 The affidavit of Ms Flannery does not suggest that she approached the Crown to determine its attitude to the raising of character. Whatever its attitude, leave was required before the accused could be cross examined on character, including the allegations in the Stephen Donnelly trial, which was then pending (s112 Evidence Act, 1995). In giving leave, the Judge would be obliged, amongst other things, to consider issues of fairness to the accused and the Crown (s192(2)(b)). It would have been open to counsel for the appellant to seek a ruling from the trial Judge that, if character were raised, whether the accused could then be cross examined on the allegations which were the subject of the next trial. That was not done. 
      
       
     45 However, ignoring these issues, can it be said that there has been a miscarriage of justice through the inability of the accused to inform the jury that he had no convictions for sexual offences? 
      
       
     46 That issue requires an appreciation of the strength of the Crown case, so that the impact of the additional evidence, favourable to the accused, might be judged in context. Knowing that the appellant had no convictions for sexual offences, was there a significant possibility that a jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had that evidence been added to other evidence relevant to Count 6A? I do not believe that there was such a possibility. I therefore do not accept that there has been a miscarriage of justice. There was, as I have said, a strong case against the appellant on Count 6A. Unlike the other counts, the complainant's account in respect of Count 6A was corroborated in a number of important respects by that of her aunt. It is unsurprising that the jury rejected the suggestion, arising from the evidence of the accused and his friend, Mr Duffy, that the appellant's wife, Ms Lynette Donnelly, was mistaken in what she believed that she saw. That suggestion involved a number of difficulties. First, Ms Lynette Donnelly fixed the time of the incident by reference to the age of her child, who was then three months. It was June or July 1986 (when the complainant was 14 or 15), not 1988. Secondly, the detail of Ms Lynette Donnelly's description corresponded exactly with that of the complainant. The appellant was lying on top of the complainant. Both were naked. She slapped his face. She described a scene which one would not be likely to forget or confuse with something as unremarkable as that described by the appellant and his friend, Mr Duffy. 
      
       
     47 There being no miscarriage, in my view, leave to add the new ground should be refused.

      70066/01  
      R v Edward George THURSTON 
       
       
      JUDGMENT - On Admission of Recorded Interview & Walkaround 
       
      
    1 His Honour: Objection was taken on behalf of the accused Lamb to the admission of his recorded interview with police commencing at 6.18 am on 30 October 2000 and the videoed walkaround with him of the crime scene commencing at 12.32 pm that day. The grounds of objection were that the requirements of Part 10A (ss 354 to 356Y) of the Crimes Act 1900 had not been complied with, and that accordingly the evidence could not be admitted unless I was satisfied that it ought to be admitted having regard to the considerations set out in s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. At the conclusion of the submissions I ruled both pieces of evidence were admissible and indicated I would give my reasons later, which I now do. 
     
      
    2 Apart from the transcripts of the interview and the walkaround, a viewing of part of the walkaround and a number of witnesses who gave evidence including the accused, the evidence also included the Custody Management Record (CMR) relating to the accused and the Local Court file relating to the application for a detention warrant in respect of the accused. The burden of proving that the video recorded interview and the walkaround qualify for admission rests on the Crown on the balance of probabilities: Evidence Act 1995, s 142. 
     
      
    3 The accused Thurston was arrested at 1.50 am and taken to the Tamworth Police Station where he was interviewed by Detectives Coe and Stenberg from 2.30 to 5.07 am. Meanwhile the accused Lamb was arrested at 1/44 Duri Road at 4.27 am and at 4.45 he left that address with police officers and arrived at the police station at 4.55 am. He then came under the custody of Sergeant Lee who was the Custody Manager until he was replaced in that capacity at 7 am by Sergeant McAuliffe. 
     
      
    4 His arrival at the police station at 4.55 am is confirmed by the entry in the CMR, the detail being entered at 4.59 am. Sergeant Lee then read him the Caution and Summary under Part 10A at 5.05 am and entered the details of so doing in the CMR at 5.12 am. He said he read him the front part of the form and summarised the back of it where there is a summary of what are referred to as ""time-outs"" which do not count towards the 4 hours referred to in s 356D. According to the CMR a copy was given to the accused. 
     
      
    5 The accused in his evidence on the voir dire denied that the Caution and Summary had been read to him, but in the subsequent interview at answer 476 the accused said, 
     
      
       
        
        ""Yeah, he just read a piece of paper saying you don't have to do anything or speak or anything"", 
         
          
        
       
      and the questioning continued. 
       
        
        Q 477, ""And that you were entitled to a solicitor and?"" 
         
          
           
           ""Eh yeah"".  
           
          
         
         
        Q 477, ""(sic)... All that sort of thing?""  
         
          
           
           ""Eh yeah"".  
           
          
         
         
        Q 478, ""And you fully understood all your rights?""  
         
          
           
           ""Eh yeah"". 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    6 In the light of the accused volunteering the reference to the Sergeant reading a ""piece of paper"", I am satisfied that the Caution and Summary was read to him. I'm not so sure about whether he was at that stage given a copy, but he claims he cannot read or write so giving him a copy would appear to be of little practical significance; although the CMR indicates that a copy was given. 
     
      
    7 It seems that these preliminary matters including the reading of the Caution, the questionnaire and the preliminary examination and assessment by Sergeant Lee, which were recorded as having been completed at 5.14 am, must have been interrupted because between 5.05 and 5.07 Sergeant Lee adopted the recorded interview with the accused Thurston, but I am satisfied that down to that stage the CMR accurately reflected what happened. 
     
      
    8 After this, the CMR gives rise to some confusion but, having regard to the entries in the Visitor Record of the CMR and referring not only to exhibit B on the voir dire, but also to the printout of such record made at about 8.29 that morning which forms part of the Local Court file (exhibit K on the voir dire) as explained in the evidence, I am satisfied that the accused Lamb requested a solicitor before interview. 
     
      
    9 At 5.15 am Sergeant Lee made a call for a legal practitioner which was unsuccessful and which he recorded at 5.20 am. Whether he called the correct number of the Kamilaroi Aboriginal Legal Service is not clear, but if he did he would have got a message that the number was unattended at that time. Then at 5.20 am another call was made in an attempt to contact the Aboriginal Legal Service but there was no answer. This is not surprising as the number dialled, 1800 101810, was the number of the Child Care Protection Unit and was unattended. The accused Lamb then told Sergeant Lee not to worry any further at that time. These details were recorded at 5.25 am. Although the wrong number was contacted I am satisfied that this was not intentional as it is unlikely Sergeant Lee would have recorded the number dialled if he knew it was the wrong number and the whole dialling operation was merely a pretence and subterfuge. 
     
      
    10 Furthermore, having regard to the fact that the accused's response, ""Not to worry"", was recorded at 5.25 am, and that by that time two attempts to contact a solicitor had apparently been made, I am satisfied that the accused probably did make that response. 
     
      
    11 Detective Coe said in his statement that after he completed the interview with the accused Thurston, which finished at 5.07, he attended to the formalities of sealing the tapes, briefing his superiors and various other matters including making arrangements regarding canvassing, searching and briefing arrangements to other police. He said that, ""around 6 am"" he attended the charge room and had a conversation with the Custody Manager, cautioned the accused and that Sergeant Lee then read aloud the form 10 A and handed the accused a copy of the document after which the accused asked for and was given a cigarette from his own property and then taken to the interview room. 
     
      
    12 In his evidence he said that he was also present when Sergeant Lee made the phone call to a solicitor and that he himself made at least one and possibly more phone calls to try and get a solicitor. I have grave doubts about some of this evidence. After the conclusion of the interview with the accused Thurston, Detective Coe had a number of formalities to complete, sealing, identifying and recording the audio and video cassettes and then briefing his superiors as to the progress of the investigation as recorded in his notebook and in his statement. 
     
      
    13 He could not, in my opinion, have had these matters completed by 5.12 am by which time the Part 10 A Caution and Summary had been read to the accused by Sergeant Lee and the reading thereof recorded. Moreover, although the entries in his notebook and in his statement are quite detailed in relation to many matters, there is nothing recorded in either place concerning those details other than that he was present when Sergeant Lee read the Part 10A Statement. In particular, there is no reference to him being present when phone calls were made or making any phone calls himself. 
     
      
    14 Moreover, the waiting times recorded on page 6 of the CMR show that Sergeant Lee recorded that a Waiting Time from 5.15 to 5.40 for the ""arrival of investigators"", and although this was not properly a ""Waiting Time"" within the meaning of the relevant section, it does record, in my view and supported by Sergeant Lee's evidence, that the time spent waiting for Detective Coe to complete his other duties and direct his attention to the accused Lamb was that period from 5.15 to 5.40 am, and Sergeant Lee went on to say that the accused Lamb was taken to the interview room at 5.40 am. 
     
      
    15 These times are impossible to reconcile. I was informed by agreement that the times shown on the video recording were wrong but it appears that the times spoken to by Detective Coe in the video were the correct times and not the times shown on the video monitor. This may have led to some of the confusion, but I am unable to say at this point of time. 
     
      
    16 The accused was taken to the interview room, according to the CMR, at 5.40 am but, according to Detective Coe's evidence ""shortly after 6 am"" and the recording of the interview commenced at 6.18 am. The accused said that whilst he was in the interview room and they were setting up the equipment and apparently while Detective Stenberg went to get some coffee, Detective Coe said to him, ""If you tell me the right thing I will help you try and get manslaughter, or something like that"", and by ""the right thing"" he thought Detective Coe meant the truth. 
     
      
    17 This is not the precise terms in which the inducement was put to Detective Coe in cross-examination (at T53) but at the end of the interview when questioned by Sergeant Lee and asked whether any threat, promise or inducement had been held out to him the accused replied, ""No"". I can accept that he may not know the meaning of an ""inducement"", but he would in my view know the meaning of a ""promise""; and to both Detective Coe and Sergeant Lee he said that no promise had been made. In particular, at answers 656 to 659 he denied any promise and in particular the answer of 658 was, 
     
      
       
        
        ""I've come in here and told the truth of my own free will."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    18 Moreover, as his sworn evidence on the voir dire relating to whether the Part 10A Caution and Summary was read to him was contradicted by what he said in the recorded interview itself, to which I have already referred, I am not prepared to accept the accused's evidence on this allegation, and I am satisfied that no such promise or inducement was made to him. 
     
      
    19 Finally, he admitted in cross-examination that he had been arrested a lot of times previously and knew he did not have to speak to police unless he wanted to. 
     
      
    20 There was, as is customary, a further Caution at the beginning of the recorded interview. I am therefore satisfied that the interview was voluntary and made of the accused's own free will and not induced by any threat, promise or inducement. 
     
      
    21 There were, however, a number of breaches of Part 10A. I am not satisfied that after the Part 10A Caution and Summary was read to him he was given a copy: s 356M (1)(b), and he was not requested to sign an acknowledgment that the information had been given, s 356M(3) but, as I say, in view of his inability to read and write, these were, in my view, breaches of little significance. 
     
      
    22 Section 356 requires that the person detained be informed orally and in writing that he may communicate with a friend, relative, guardian or independent person and with a legal practitioner for the purposes indicated in the section. I am satisfied that by the reading of the Part 10A Summary the accused was so informed and attempts were made on his behalf, unsuccessfully, to contact a legal practitioner. 
     
      
    23 The accused is an Aboriginal and therefore a ""vulnerable person"" within the Crimes (Detention After Arrest) Regulation 1998, cl 5 and, accordingly additional provisions apply. Under cl 20 the Custody Manager must assist a vulnerable person in exercising his rights under Part 10A including any right to make a telephone call to a legal practitioner, support person or other person. This is a positive duty to assist the vulnerable person in exercising his or her rights: R v Phung Huynh [2001] NSWSC 115 at [63], and is not limited to assisting with the making of telephone calls. The Custody Manager did assist with attempted telephone calls to a lawyer, but did not assist him with getting a support person. It is not sufficient in the case of a vulnerable person to read to him his right to contact a support person, but the Custody Manager should advise him in respect of such right, and I am satisfied that Sergeant Lee failed to do this. But there is no evidence that he would have wanted one in any event, and I can understand that some people would be embarrassed by having a relative or other person present while they were interviewed. 
     
      
    24 Sergeant Lee in his evidence conceded that the accused was a vulnerable person and that, accordingly, he had a positive duty to actively assist the accused but he could not recall speaking to him about his rights to a lawyer or support person beyond reading to him what was in the Part 10A Caution and Summary. 
     
      
    25 Under cl 28, an Aboriginal Legal Aid Organisation must be contacted and this is so whether the suspect wants such service notified or not: R v Helmhout [2000] NSWSC 208, 112 ACR 10 at [11]. An attempt was made to do so but was unsuccessful. And although he was notified by the reading of the Part 10A Summary of his right to a support person, no additional advice was given in relation to this. 
     
      
    26 It follows that there were a number of breaches of the regime laid down by the Act and Regulation designed to provide safeguards to persons in custody for questioning, particularly vulnerable persons. I had therefore to consider whether I should exercise my discretion to exclude the recorded interview on the ground that, having regard to the circumstances in which it was made, it would be unfair to the defendant to use the evidence: Evidence Act, s 90; or whether, having regard to the breaches indicated, the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting the evidence that had been obtained in the way in which it was obtained: s 138. 
     
      
    27 I am satisfied that although such breaches were not deliberate or intentional, certainly more could have been done, but the accused was willing to answer questions, was fully aware that he did not have to, and had told the police not to worry when they could not get in touch with the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service whom they had endeavoured to contact. The accused has been arrested on a number of occasions previously and was therefore not unfamiliar with the processes of criminal investigation, and he gave the unequivocal answer 658 which I have already quoted. I was therefore not satisfied that in the circumstances in which the interview was conducted it would be unfair to use that interview against the accused within the terms of s 90. 
     
      
    28 It was therefore necessary to consider the provisions of s 138, including the particular matters set out in ss (3); and it is convenient to deal with those paragraphs seriatim: 
     
      
      (a) The evidence is of extremely high probative value containing, as it does, direct admissions of the accused's involvement in the vicious attack on the deceased which caused his death. 
       
      (b) The importance of the evidence is increased by the fact that there were no eyewitnesses to the assault, and it is otherwise a circumstantial case. 
       
      (c) The offence with which the accused is charged is murder, the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. In  
      Bunning v Cross 
       (1978) 141 CLR 54 at 74-5, 78 the High Court made it clear that the more serious the offence the greater the public interest in admitting evidence which may lead to the conviction of the perpetrators, and the Australian Law Reform Commission has expressed a similar view: see ALRC 26 vol 1 p 964. 
       
      (d) I have already said, more could have been done particularly by way of advising the accused to have a support person present, but the other breaches were rather of a technical nature and, apart from the right to such support person, the accused was aware of his rights. I shall deal with inaccuracy in the CMR later when considering the walkaround, but they do not significantly affect the recorded interview. 
       
      (e) Although the dialling of the wrong number for the Aboriginal Legal Service was careless, I do not regard it as deliberate or reckless, nor do I regard any of the other breaches referred to in that way. Although, as I have said, more could have been done, I would expect that Tamworth Police Station would be under a great deal of pressure at this hour of the morning with two people arrested for questioning in relation to the apparent vicious killing of a man in a park, and other police were no doubt directed to various assignments to seek further evidence in relation to the matter. 
       
      (f) This is not relevant but I note that the accused had been arrested on a number of previous occasions and was familiar with his rights and would not be as overawed by unfamiliar surroundings and processes in the same way as a child may or a person arrested for the first time have been. 
       
      (g) No other proceedings are likely in relation to the breaches. 
       
      (h) The provisions of Part 10A could have been fully complied with and the evidence probably still been forthcoming, but this can only be speculation. 
       
      
    29 Bearing all these matters in mind, particularly the high probative value and the importance of the evidence, the seriousness of the offence and the accused's willingness to answer questions, and the fact that there was no deliberate flouting of the requirements, I was satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting evidence which had been obtained in the way it had, and accordingly admitted the evidence of the interview. 
     
      
    30 Towards the end of the interview the accused was asked (Q 642) whether he was prepared to point out to the detectives the places in Granny Munro Park where the events described in his interview had taken place and have it recorded on video to which he replied in the affirmative. 
     
      
    31 The interview was completed at 7.48 am after being adopted before an independent officer, Sergeant McAuliffe, who had replaced Sergeant Lee at 7 am. Detective Coe subsequently spoke with Dr Fisher and arranged for him to come and take a blood sample from each accused and Dr Fisher later attended and did so. At 9.24 I am satisfied Detective Coe had a conversation with Mr Baxter-Wright, the solicitor for the Kamilaroi Aboriginal Legal Service and told him of his intention to apply for a detention warrant and to conduct a walkaround. Mr Baxter-Wright saw the accused twice on that day accompanied by Ms Bond, and it appears from the CMR that one of these conferences was from 9.30 to 9.50 am. 
     
      
    32 The time during which a suspect can be held for questioning without a detention warrant is four hours: s 356 D; but certain times do not count (s 356F), and provided it is applied for before such four hours expires, a detention warrant can be obtained from an authorised justice extending the period during which the suspect may be detained for further investigations: s 356G. 
     
      
    33 In addition to the breaches relied on in respect of the recorded interview, it was also submitted that accurate records were not kept: 356V; that the detention warrant was not applied for within the four hours and was obtained on false information, and also that Sergeant McAuliffe failed to assist the accused as a vulnerable person in relation to the detention warrant, and failed to give him a copy of the CMR: S 356V(5). There may have been some other breaches of a technical nature but these were the main matters of substance. 
     
      
    34 The first error in the CMR relied on is in respect of the box headed ""Visitor Record"" which records telephone calls which should have been included in the ""Communication Record""; otherwise this part of the record is accurate. 
     
      
    35 The ""Communication Record"" records two calls, one at 8.01 am to number 67666733 about which no evidence was given, and another one at 9.13 am to Dr Fisher to the effect that medical attention was required. This was inaccurate in that the accused did not require medical attention, but the police wanted a doctor to attend and examine any marks or wounds of the deceased and take blood. This would not be the provision of medical attention but would be part of the investigation. 
     
      
    36 In the section marked ""Waiting Times"" it is recorded that Mr Baxter-Wright and his assistant, Ms Bond, arrived at 9.30 am and spoke with the accused, leaving at 9.50 am. This accords in substance with the evidence of Mr Baxter-Wright who said he was informed by Detective Coe that the two accused were in custody charged with murder, and he and Ms Bond spoke with the accused Lamb twice that morning. He also said he was informed that the police were applying for a detention warrant and wished to conduct a walkaround, and that he discussed this latter matter with the accused. 
     
      
    37 The other entry under “Waiting Times” is from 5.15 to 5.40 am, described as ""Arrival of Investigators"" and appears to represent the period between when Sergeant Lee completed the formalities on the accused's arrival, and Detective Coe arrived in the Charge Room, having completed the formal matters relating to his interview with the accused Thurston. This should not have been recorded as a “Waiting Time” as s 356F(b) refers to time ""reasonably spent waiting for the arrival at the place where the person is being detained of police officers ...."" In other words, the arrival of the investigating police at the police station where the suspect is being held, not waiting for the investigating police to complete other tasks when they are already at the relevant station, although another time which can be taken into account is in para (C), namely, time reasonably spent waiting for facilities for complying with s 424A to become available, which would cover waiting for the ERISP facilities to become available. 
     
      
    38 As I understand Det Stenberg's evidence, which was not entirely clear on this point, he was preparing the application for the detention warrant. From the time he obtained a printout of the computer generated CMR up to that time at 8.29 am (exhibit K) until he went to see the Justice at 9.15 am, and a warrant was issued at 9.30 am to operate from 10 am. 
     
      
    39 The CMR (exhibit B) contains two forms of application marked A and B but the Local Court file (exhibit K) only contains the latter. I was satisfied that however document A came into existence, it was not used, and that the document in the CMR marked B, which forms part of exhibit K, was the application form which was placed before the justice. 
     
      
    40 There are some inaccuracies in the such application, particularly in para 2 as to “Waiting Times”, and I have some doubt about para 8 that the detained person had been informed of his right to make representations to the authorised justice. He certainly was when the Part 10A Summary was read out to him some four hours earlier, but he should have been informed again in clear and explicit terms, and as a vulnerable person been given advice about it. 
     
      
    41 Moreover, two questions arose in relation to the times, firstly, whether the application was made within four hours and whether the four hours had expired prior to the commencement time for the detention warrant at 10 am. 
     
      
    42 The accused was arrested at 4.27 am. The times which do not count are set out in s 356F and I deal with them in turn: 
     
      
      (a) although arrested at 4.27 am they did not leave the premises where he was arrested until 4.45 am and they arrived at the police station at 4.55 am, therefore the appropriate allowance is only ten minutes. 
       
      (b) as already indicated, the investigating police were already at Tamworth Police Station and no time can be allowed under this paragraph. 
       
      (c) refers to awaiting the availability of the interview room where ERISP equipment was. Thurston's custody record shows that he was returned to the custody manager's custody at 5.20 am but the formalities relating to the accused Lamb were not completed by Sergeant Lee, according to his CMR until 5.16 am. Accordingly, I only allow four minutes under this paragraph. 
       
      (d) attempts to contact a legal representatives, one minute.  
       
      (e) and (f) are not relevant. 
       
      (g) as already indicated, awaiting the arrival of Dr Fisher was not for medical attention but was part of the investigation and nothing can be allowed under this paragraph. 
       
      (j) the accused was provided with breakfast from 8 to 8.30 am according to the CMR and I allow thirty minutes for this paragraph. 
       
      (k) was not relevant. 
       
      (l) refers to any time that is reasonably required to prepare, make and dispose of any application for a detention warrant. It appears that for the purpose of preparing the application a printout of the CMR to that stage was obtained at 8.29 am and Detective Stenberg saw the authorised justice at 9.15. I do not accept that it should have taken 45 minutes to prepare the application, but I was prepared to allow a quarter of an hour to prepare the application, and the evidence establishes that the making of the application actually took 15 minutes from 9.15 to 9.30 am. Also at the end of that time and within paragraph (d) there was a 20 minute conference between the accused and his legal representative Mr Baxter-Wright from 9.30 to 9.50 am, a total of 20 minutes. 
       
      
    43 All those ""time-outs"" add up to 95 minutes. He was arrested at 4.27 am, and the four hours would have expired at 8.27 am. When one adds 95 minutes to that time, one arrives at 10.12 am and the detention warrant was in force from 10 am. Therefore, he was not unlawfully detained without a detention warrant. 
     
      
    44 However, it is also important to note that the application was made at 9.15 am, and by that time he had not seen Mr Baxter-Wright and, accordingly, the 20 minutes for the legal consultation could not be taken into account in calculating the time permitted for making the application, but on my calculations, the 75 minutes added to 8.27 am is 9.42 am, and I am satisfied the application was made within time. 
     
      
    45 Therefore, although there were some breaches of Part 10A prior to the video walkaround and some inaccuracy in the records and in the application, the application was, in my view, validly made, and made within time. 
     
      
    46 I should add that I accept Detective Stenberg's evidence that apart from the matters set out in the application form he also gave oral evidence before the authorised justice when making the application. 
     
      
    47 I turn therefore to the provisions of s 138. The evidence contained in the walkaround is of high probative value, but is not so important to the Crown case as the recorded interview in view of the admissions made in that interview. The contraventions were not reckless or deliberate and with proper procedure and record keeping it is probable that the detention warrant could still have been issued. Otherwise, generally similar considerations apply as with the recorded interview in respect of the matters referred to in s 138(3). 
     
      
    48 However, there is another important factor in respect of the walkaround and that is that before it was undertaken Mr Baxter-Wright was notified of the arrest, the charge and the police intentions to seek a detention warrant and have the walkaround. And before the walkaround took place the accused had a conference with Mr Baxter-Wright where the walkaround was discussed. In those circumstances I was satisfied that the evidence of the video walkaround should be admitted. 
     
      
    49 One other objection was taken to the admission of the walkaround, and that was that the accused is shown in the video handcuffed, and it was submitted that to show this video to the jury would be unfairly prejudicial to the accused. I reject this submission. The jury know that by the time of the walkaround the accused had been charged with murder. They do not live on another planet and I would expect them to be amazed if they saw a man who had just been charged with murder walking around a park even in the company of police, without being handcuffed. It was for these reasons that I admitted the evidence. The recorded interview and the videoed walkaround were both admissible.

       FACTS 
       
      
      
       
       The Respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of armed robbery in company. He was sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months with a non-parole period of twelve months. This sentence was determined by the sentencing judge after allowing a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty and a further discount of 50% for co-operation with the authorities. The Respondent was one month short of his twentieth birthday when he committed the offence. The crown appealed against the sentence imposed, submitting that it was manifestly inadequate. 
       
      
      
       
       HELD 
       
      
      
       
       A 
        The sentencing judge did not err in taking into account as a separate element and quantifying the value of the plea. Criticism of a “two stage approach” to sentencing in  
       Wong v The Queen 
        [2001] HCA 64; 76 ALJR 79 does not require the court to overrule  
       R v Thomson 
        (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, which should still be followed. 
        
       R v Place 
        [2002] SASC 101 discussed. 
       
      
      
       
       B 
        The sentencing judge did not err in taking into account the utilitarian value of the plea in accordance with  
       R v Thomson 
       . The subjective perspective of a “willingness to facilitate the course of justice” referred to in  
       Cameron v The Queen 
        [2002] HCA 6; 76 ALJR 382, is not, in New South Wales, required to operate to the exclusion of objective considerations. Section 22 of the  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        1999 has amended the common law in this respect.  
       R v Morton  
       [1986] VR 863 referred to. The meaning of the word “ambiguous” in s34 of the  
       Interpretation Act  
       1987 discussed 
       . 
       
      
      
       
       C 
        The sentence imposed gave an excessive discount for the combined effect of the plea and assistance and was manifestly inadequate. 
       
      
      
       
       ORDERS 
       
      
      
       
       1 Crown appeal allowed. 
        
       2 Sentence imposed quashed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a crown appeal under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The Respondent pleaded guilty to one charge of robbery in company contrary to s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. His Honour Judge Woods QC sentenced the Respondent to imprisonment for eighteen months with a non-parole period of twelve months. The non-parole period will expire on 3 May 2002. 
      
       
        
       Factual Background 
        
       
     2 During the late afternoon of 21 March 2001 the Respondent was travelling as a passenger in a motor vehicle driven by his co-offender, Vikash Nair. A conversation occurred with respect to committing an armed robbery on unspecified premises and Nair produced a knife from underneath the front passenger seat. The Respondent agreed to participate in the offence. 
      
       
     3 At 5.00pm the two offenders left their parked car and walked to the Mount Ku-ring-gai Motel located on the Pacific Highway in Sydney. They entered the foyer area of the motel where the owner, Mr Graham Cheng, was seated behind the counter. Vikash Nair jumped over the counter, produced the knife – which Mr Cheng described as ten inches long - threatened Cheng with it and demanded that he open the cash drawer. Cheng complied with the demand and the offenders left with about $300 in cash from the drawer. 
      
       
     4 A few moments later Cheng called for assistance from an occupant of the motel, Mr Sexton. Sexton and a number of other people pursued the offenders. The Respondent was found hiding in bushland in the vicinity of the motel. Police were called and the Respondent was arrested. 
      
       
     5 At the time of his arrest he told police that he knew the co-offender by his nickname “Max”. He did, however, indicate to the police that he and his co-offender had left identification documents in the car, still parked near the scene. It does not appear whether or not the police found anything in the car or would have been able to identify the co-offender from ownership records of the car. 
      
       
     6 The Respondent participated in a Record of Interview and admitted his involvement in the offence. He gave details of the circumstances of the offence. Subsequently the Respondent made a further statement to police and identified his co-offender as Vikash Nair. 
      
       
     7 The Respondent was one month short of his twentieth birthday when he committed the offence. He had previously been dealt with in the Local Court in relation to charges of possessing a prohibited drug and entering enclosed lands.  
      
       
     8 The Respondent signed an undertaking to give evidence against the co-offender Nair. According to a statement from a police officer it was likely that Nair “could have avoided apprehension and prosecution” but for the Respondent’s assistance. 
      
       
     9 The Respondent was granted bail after his arrest but as a result of his failure to comply with bail conditions he was rearrested. At the time of the hearing before Woods DCJ he had served five and a half months. The sentence was backdated with the effect that by the time the matter was heard in this Court the non-parole period had almost expired. 
      
       
     10 A pre-sentence report found the Respondent unsuitable for either a community service order or periodic detention because of his poor response to supervision while on bail. The Respondent had breached bail conditions including a failure to attend for counselling and assessment. The officer noted: 
      
       
        
         
          “When he did report, for the preparation of this report and for bail supervision, he presented as aggressive and evasive and refused to discuss issues with the undersigned, regardless of a direction by the Court. He appeared to regard the consequences for failing to comply as a joke, often laughing about his situation and possible outcomes.” 
         
        
       
     11 The Respondent’s father left home when he was two years of age. The Respondent reported a history of sex abuse between the ages of ten and thirteen. He claimed to have been bashed by his uncle when a young child, but this was not confirmed by his mother. He said he started using cannabis at the age of thirteen or fourteen and smoked it daily until the age of fifteen or sixteen, when he commenced using heroin on a daily basis. He commenced binge drinking at the age of fourteen or fifteen. He reportedly attempted suicide in December 2000. 
      
       
     12 The Respondent gave evidence. He said that he had worked fulltime as a clerk since being incarcerated at Parklea Correctional Centre. He said that he was studying and had participated in drug and alcohol counselling. He said that he had been in protective custody for approximately one and a half months prior to being sentenced. 
      
       
     13 There was evidence before the Court of support from his family and girlfriend. The Respondent indicated that upon his release he intended to live with his mother. 
      
       
     14 A psychiatrist’s report was tendered. This outlined the Respondent’s personal history, focusing on the need for support with respect to substance abuse. A psychologist’s report repeated part of the history with more detail of incidents of self harm and long term difficulties with anger management. 
      
       
     15 The crown submitted that the Respondent’s reference to his co-offender as “Max” constituted an initial refusal to co-operate with the authorities. This does not appear to be the case. Within a minute or so of using the name, he also referred to the car in which he and the co-offender had come to the motel and stated that identification for himself and his co-offender were to be found in that car. Subsequently the Respondent continued to refer to the co-offender as “Max”, for example during the course of the electronically recorded interview. The only hesitation was the suggestion that he only knew “Max” by his nickname. In a subsequent statement he admitted that he always knew the co-offender’s full name and suburb of residence, which he provided to the police. 
      
       
     16 In his remarks on sentence Woods DCJ referred to the plea, the undertaking to give evidence against the co-offender, the Respondent’s youth and his drug problem. 
      
       
     17 His Honour referred to the principle that armed robbery generally requires a custodial sentence and referred to the requirements of general and personal deterrence. His Honour accepted that a sentence of fulltime custody was required. His Honour also said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The appropriate sentence for a case such as this has been considered in the guideline case of  
         Henry, 
          the circumstances of which are quite similar to the present matter. A knife was used, there was no actual physical violence involved, but there was a real threat, and no doubt the display of the knife by the co-offender in company with the offender, Sharma, must have distressed Mr Cheng considerably. It certainly prompted him, sensibly, to open the till with great alacrity. 
         
        
        
         
         The appropriate starting point, it seems to me, for calculating the appropriate sentence in this case, given the fact that he is a first offender even though it is an offence in company, he has played, it seems to me, a lesser role, is four years in prison. There has been a plea of guilty, it is an early plea, and he is to have the benefit of that. The contrition which he shows by the plea, and which he has exhibited by giving evidence in the witness box, and from the utilitarian component of avoiding the necessity for a trial, these things combined cause me to allow a discount of some twenty-five percent on sentence, and that I would reduce the point at which I would further consider the sentence to three years. 
         
        
        
         
         There is, however, another consideration in this case. The other offender, Nair, was not caught immediately and, according to exhibit C which I accept, probably would not have been caught but for being nominated in his frank disclosure by this offender. 
         
        
        
         
         I take into account all of the matters listed in s23 of the  
         Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         , and especially, as I say, that the co-offender would not otherwise have been caught, exhibit C, and particularly also the fact that the offender is on protection which will mean that his time spent in custody is doubly uncomfortable. I will allow a reduction of the notional sentence by fifty percent in the circumstances.” 
         
        
       
     18 Exhibit C to which his Honour referred was the statement by the constable relating to the value of the assistance. 
      
       
     19 His Honour imposed a head sentence of eighteen months. He found special circumstances in the Respondent’s youth and history of drug addiction, which required a longer than normal period of supervision. He fixed a non-parole period of twelve months. 
      
       
        
       Utilitarian Value of the Plea 
        
       
     20 A legal issue of general significance has arisen in the submissions in this case. That issue is whether a sentencing judge is permitted, when taking into account a plea of guilty, to quantify a discount to be given for the plea and, in any event, to give weight to the utilitarian value of the plea. 
      
       
     21 With respect to the effect to be given to the plea of guilty, Woods DCJ was, of course, bound by R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. His Honour allowed a discount of twenty-five percent, which he expressed to be for both the element of contrition and also for what his Honour referred to, in accordance with practice in this State, as “the utilitarian component of avoiding the necessity for a trial”. This Court’s decision in Thomson indicated that the utilitarian value of the plea “should generally be assessed in the range of ten to twenty-five percent discount on sentence” (at [160]). 
      
       
     22 The crown raised the question as to whether or not this Court’s guidance in Thomson remained appropriate, in view of the High Court’s decisions in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 76 ALJR 79 and Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6; 76 ALJR 382. 
      
       
     23 In Wong the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ disapproved of the “two stage” approach to sentencing – sometimes contrasted with an “instinctive synthesis” approach - by which a preliminary sentence is determined and thereafter adjusted “by some mathematical value given to one or more features of the case, such as a plea of guilty or assistance to authorities” (at [76]). Their Honours said that a two stage approach is “wrong in principle” (at [76]). Their Honours noted that in AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111, McHugh J at [15]-[18] and Hayne J at [115] expressed the same view, Kirby J expressing a contrary view at [99]-[100]. 
      
       
     24 As the joint judgment in Wong indicated at [76], the relevant line of authority was analysed in some detail by myself in R v Thomson at [54]-[113]. Specifically I said at [57]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The instinctive synthesis approach is the correct general approach to sentencing. This does not, however, necessarily mean that there is no element which can be taken out and treated separately, although such elements ought be few in number and narrowly confined. As long as they are such, their separate treatment will not compromise the intuitive or instinctive character of the sentencing process considered as a whole.” 
         
        
       
     25 In this respect I relied on the reasoning of Gleeson CJ and Hunt J in R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220. (See Thomson at [68]-[72].) 
      
       
     26 I also referred to a number of other intermediate appellate court decisions that had acknowledged the appropriateness of a percentage discount, relevantly, for a plea of guilty. The other members of this Court in Thomson agreed with my judgment.  
      
       
     27 In Wong, the other member of the majority was Kirby J. His Honour did not join in the criticism of a two stage approach to sentencing. The reasoning of the joint judgment in this respect was of the same character as that considered by a five judge bench of this Court in Thomson. For the reasons there given, an “instinctive synthesis” approach was not adopted with respect to the particular matter now under consideration, i.e. quantification by a sentencing judge of the discount she or he has applied for the plea. This Court should not reconsider a recent decision of a five judge bench unless it is required to do so by the doctrine of precedent. It is not so required. The Court cannot add, in some notional way, the three judges who joined in the joint judgment in Wong with the opinion expressed by McHugh J in AB. (See also Cameron at [41].)  
      
       
     28 As the authorities considered in Thomson indicate, the Supreme Court of South Australia has also adopted the practice of encouraging sentencing judges to quantify the discount given for a plea of guilty. After the High Court’s decision in Wong the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia considered the implications of that judgment in R v Powell [2001] SASC 450. It concluded by a majority of two to one that the previous practice could continue, notwithstanding the criticism of a “two stage approach” to sentencing in the joint judgment in Wong. The matter was of sufficient practical significance for the Supreme Court of South Australia to convene a five judge bench in R v Place [2002] SASC 101, where the Court unanimously came to the same conclusion. 
      
       
     29 The judgment in Place considers at some length the implications of Wong for the practice in South Australia of suggesting sentencing standards for some offences. It also considers the implications of the reasoning in Wong for the practice with respect to pleas of guilty. The joint judgment of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal focuses on the reference in the joint judgment in Wong to “a mathematical approach to sentencing in which there are to be increments to, or decrements from, a predetermined range of sentences”. (See Place at [35].) Their Honours set out in some detail the development of the practice of quantifying the discount in South Australia and also to the practice in other States. In the event, their Honours unanimously affirm the majority decision in Powell that the judgment in Wong does not require the court to change its practice. 
      
       
     30 Their Honours concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “[80] The ‘mathematical’ two-stage approach with which the High Court was concerned in  
         Wong 
          is not the process which has been approved and adopted in South Australia with respect to reductions for pleas of guilty. The views expressed in the joint judgment concerning a two-stage approach, and in particular the example given with respect to identifying a reduction for a plea of guilty, were not the views of a majority. In our opinion this Court is not constrained by authority to hold that the existing practice in this State in wrong. In our view, the current practice is consistent with the requirements of s10 of the  
         Sentencing Act 
          and conforms with sentencing principles. The failure to identify a specific reduction is not an error of principle nor, in itself, is it a ground for interference with a sentence. Significantly, the South Australian practice does not detract from the requirement that sentencing courts take into account all relevant matters relating to the offence of the offender. The practice must not give rise to any distortion of the sentencing process or invite error. It does not interfere with the important consideration of proportionality. The views expressed by McHugh J in  
         AB 
          and in the joint judgment in  
         Wong 
          have not come to fruition in the ten years that the practice has existed in this State. 
         
        
        
         
         [81] The authorities to which we have referred have identified compelling reasons in public policy why the extent of a reduction of sentence in recognition of a plea of guilty should be identified. Experience in this State and in New South Wales has demonstrated that the public policy objectives are not achieved unless the specific reduction is identified. Offenders and their legal advisers are able to identify in advance and with some confidence an approximate range of reduction that is likely to accompany a plea of guilty. After sentence has been imposed an offender is not left in any doubt as to whether benefit was given for a plea of guilty as full knowledge of the extent of the reduction and the reasons it are given. The community and the appellate court is similarly well informed. The initial scepticism that accompanied the general recognition that a plea of guilty entitled an offender to a degree of mitigation has disappeared. 
         
        
        
         
         [82] The system is fair and practical. It has worked well in practice for a number of years. In our opinion it would be a retrograde step to discourage sentencers from continuing with the current practice. It would be very difficult to explain to offenders and the community why the Court has departed from its present practice. An explanation for the departure based on describing the sentencing processes as an instinctive synthesis would be greeted with scepticism. 
         
        
        
         
         [83] For these reasons, in our opinion the current practice should continue and this Court should continue to encourage sentencing courts to identify the specific reduction given in respect of a plea of guilty. In determining the extent of a reduction, the current practice of taking into account the timing of the plea, contrition, cooperation with and assistance to the authorities should continue. We emphasise that when taking into account any subjective considerations, sentencing courts should not ignore those subject considerations to the extent that they are relevant to other aspects of the sentencing task.” 
         
        
       
     31 For similar reasons, in my opinion, the practice in this State, which has developed over a considerable period, culminating in the guideline judgment in Thomson, should also continue. 
      
       
     32 In Cameron a bench of five sat. There was a majority joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ, which is binding on this Court.  
      
       
     33 Their Honours quoted, at [11], from the four judge joint judgment in Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656 at [22], which referred to mitigation of sentence on a plea as in part being based “on the pragmatic ground that the community is spared the expense of a contested trial”. This was a passage expressly relied upon by this Court in Thomson at [4].  
      
       
     34 The joint judgment in Cameron stated, after referring to the passage in Siganto: 
      
       
        
         
         “[11] It should at once be noted that remorse is not necessarily the only subjective matter revealed by a plea of guilty. The plea may also indicate acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. 
         
        
        
         
         [12] Although a plea of guilty may be taken into account in mitigation a convicted person may not be penalised for having insisted on his or her right to trial. The distinction between allowing a reduction for a plea of guilty and not penalising a convicted person for not pleading guilty is not without its subtleties, but it is, nonetheless, a real distinction, albeit one the rationale for which may need some refinement in expression if the distinction is to be seen as non-discriminatory. 
         
        
        
         
         [13] It is difficult to see that a person who has exercised his or her right to trial is not being discriminated against by reason of his or her exercising that right if, in otherwise comparable circumstances, another’s plea of guilty results in a reduction of the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed on the pragmatic and objective ground that the plea has saved the community the expense of a trial. However, the same is not true if the plea is seen, subjectively, as the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice.  
         
        
        
         
         [14] Reconciliation of the requirement that a person not be penalised for pleading not guilty with the rule that a plea of guilty may be taken into account in mitigation requires that the rationale for the rule, so far as it depends on factors other than remorse and acceptance of responsibility, be expressed in terms of willingness to facilitate the course of justice and not on the basis that the plea has saved the community the expense of a contested hearing.” 
         
        
       
     35 In the present case, Woods DCJ referred to “the utilitarian component of avoiding the necessity for a trial”. In doing so his Honour adopted terminology which has long been accepted in this State and which was reaffirmed in Thomson, which not only identified the utilitarian value of a plea in objective terms, but provided for a distinct quantification for the utilitarian value in circumstances where it rejected the submissions of the crown, and of the intervening Attorney General, that a discount be given for the whole of the value of a plea, incorporating all relevant elements including both the utilitarian element and other elements such as remorse. (See e.g. at [115], [116] and [160].) 
      
       
     36 If the reasoning in Cameron is applicable in this State, then the foundation of the judgment in Thomson is swept away. For purposes of the instant case, his Honour will have erred in taking into consideration a utilitarian component in the objective sense, without focusing his attention exclusively on the subjective aspect.  
      
       
     37 The discount range of ten to twenty-five percent established by Thomson, was based on the utilitarian value of the plea understood in an objective sense. There is no reason to accept that a discount of this order of magnitude would be appropriate as a separate element, if the courts’ consideration were confined to the subjective factor of preparedness to facilitate the administration of justice. The size of the discount identified as appropriate in Thomson was determined by pragmatic considerations. If such considerations are not permitted to be taken into account, then the size of the discount identified in Thomson, which is reflected in the size of the discount given by his Honour, would no longer be appropriate. 
      
       
     38 The joint judgment in Cameron was concerned with general sentencing principles. It did so in the context of a West Australian statute. Those sentencing principles would be applicable in New South Wales, unless they have been modified by statute. If they had been so modified, then the different reasoning of Kirby J in Cameron at [65]-[68] would be pertinent for the practice in this State. This Court must determine whether there has been such a modification. In R v Place the five judge bench of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal suggested, at [64]-[79], without needing to finally decide the question, that Cameron did not apply under the legislation of that State. 
      
       
     39 In 1990 the New South Wales Parliament introduced s439 of the Crimes Act 1900. The section has now been re-enacted, in substantially the same form, as s22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “22(1) In passing sentence for an offence on an offender who has pleaded guilty to the offence, a court must taken into account: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty and may accordingly impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) When passing sentence on such an offender, a court that does not impose a lesser penalty under this section must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for not doing so. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decision. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate any sentence imposed by the court.” 
         
        
       
     40 The formulation in Cameron of “willingness to facilitate the course of justice” echoes the remarks of King CJ in R v Shannon (1979) 21 SASR 442 at 454-453 where his Honour put forward a number of propositions with respect to the effect of a plea as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1 A plea of guilty may be taken into account in mitigation of sentence where - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) it results from genuine remorse, repentance or contrition, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) it results from a willingness to cooperation in the administration of justice by saving the expense and inconvenience of a trial, or the necessity of witnesses giving evidence, or results from some other consideration which is in the public interest; notwithstanding that the motive, or one of the motives, for such cooperation may be a desire to earn leniency, and where to allow the plea a mitigatory effect would be conducive to the public purposes which the sentencing judge is seeking to achieve.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     41 Although subjective considerations were emphasised in this judgment, King CJ subsequently invoked objective elements. For example, in R v Sutherland (SASC, 16 November 1992, unreported), his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “This Court of Criminal Appeal has stressed the importance of the discount for a plea of guilty in the administration of justice. It is intended to encourage guilty persons to admit their guilt, instead of putting the State to the cost and trouble of a criminal trial and thereby contributing to the congestion of the criminal lists. This is an important public policy …” 
         
        
       
     42 A subjective perspective on the matter is also referred to, albeit in addition to an objective perspective, in a judgment of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria at about the same time. (R v Gray [1977] VR 225 at 323): 
      
       
        
         
         “… the plea may be evidence of remorse, that is, regret as to participation in the crime … There are other factors that operate in the public interest. The plea may operate, and may have been so intended, to save a prosecutrix the ordeal of giving evidence in a sexual case. The plea may serve, and may have been so intended, to save the State a lengthy and expensive trial. Yet in neither of such cases might the accused feel genuine remorse. There may be cases in which the only sorrow felt by him is in the fact that he has been detected. But having been detected he has had to do the best he can for himself. Weighing the strength of a possible defence against the likely penalty upon conviction he may elect deliberately to adopt a course which involves the measure of public utility in the belief that his own ultimate interest is best served by doing so. The judge may (not shall) take such circumstance into account in the accused’s favour. If such action be tainted overmuch by self interest it probably will not avail the accused. Professor Sir Rupert Cross in his book  
         The English 
           
         Sentencing System 
          (1971) p153 suggests that it is in the interests of the present judicial system that provided they are in fact guilty, accused persons should plead guilty. No doubt great cost to the community in time, convenience and money is thereby saved. However expedient as this may be from the point of view of the executive, it is not a matter which requires the sentencing judge to reduce the sentence below that which he otherwise believes to be proper in the circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         On the other hand, there may be pleas of guilty which are not designed to serve the public interest – or may do so only marginally or incidentally. That is to say, the accused’s self interest is completely predominant in the decision reached by him. One such case will be when the accused is quite unrepentant and confesses his guilt simply because the case against him is overwhelming and, in a practical sense, unanswerable. Now there may be a case of ‘plea bargaining’ between the accused or his advisers and the Crown, as, for instance, where the Crown accepts an offer by the accused to plead guilty to a lesser offence. The entry of a ‘guilty’ plea is then merely a manifestation of an exchange of an advantage for a disadvantage by both the accused and the Crown. In such case it will ordinarily be much more difficult to persuade the court that the guilty plea has that degree of spontaneity or sincerity expected to be the product of true repentance. But, of course, a plea bargain and remorse are not mutually exclusive. A remorseful accused ought not be prevented from taking the benefit of any arrangement he can advantageously make with the Crown nor penalised on that account if he does.” 
         
        
       
     43 R v Gray suggested, but did not determine, that public benefit in an objective sense was relevant. 
      
       
     44 In 1985 the Victorian Parliament enacted the Penalties and Sentences Act 1985 (Vic). Section 4 of which provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “4(1) A court in passing sentence for an offence on a person who pleaded guilty to the offence may take into account in fixing the sentence the fact that the person pleaded guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) If under subsection (1) a court reduces the sentence that it would otherwise have passed on a person the court must state that fact when passing sentence. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) The failure of a court to comply with subsection (2) does not invalidate any sentence imposed by it.” 
         
        
       
     45 In R v Morton [1986] VR 863, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria had to consider what, if any, effect this legislation had on the pre-existing common law as set out in R v Gray.  This analysis is of particular significance for the effect of the New South Wales legislation originally enacted as s439 of the Crimes Act. The Full Court of the Victorian Supreme Court found that the section did amend the common law in respects relevant to the construction of s439.  
      
       
     46 The joint judgment said at 867-868 (emphasis added): 
      
       
        
         
         “If sub-section (1) stood alone, it might be regarded merely as declaratory of the existing law, but the reference in the sub-section simply to the plea of guilty without qualification suggests that something more was intended. Parliament must be taken to know the law and the courts in this State have for a long time taken a plea of guilty into account when passing sentence in any case in which they have considered it appropriate to do so: see, for example  
         R v Gray 
          [1977] VR 225. Sub-section (2) confirms that something more than a mere declaration of the existing law is intended. That sub-section shows first of all that the taking into account of a plea of guilty, if it has an effect at all upon the sentence passed, is to operate to reduce not to increase the sentence. So much might again be regarded as no more than declaratory. But having regard to the principles stated in  
         R v Gray 
         , the absence of any words of limitation in sub-section (1) or in sub-section (2) and  
         the absence of any direction as to the purposes for which or the circumstances in which a plea of guilty may be taken into account in fixing a sentence lead inevitably to the conclusion that a plea of guilty may be taken into account regardless of whether or not it is also indicative of some other quality or attribute such as remorse which is regarded as relevant for sentencing purposes 
         . The existence of sub-section (2) with its mandatory requirement upon the court, if it ‘under sub-section (1)’ reduces the sentence it would otherwise have passed, to state that fact when passing sentence,  
         shows the intention of Parliament to encourage the practice of a court's taking a plea of guilty into account in an accused's favour 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         The judgment of the majority in  
         R v Gray 
          contains, at pp 230-3, a discussion of the occasions upon which and the extent to which it was, prior to the passing of s4, appropriate for a court to allow a plea of guilty to operate in mitigation of sentence. It is unnecessary to rehearse what is there said, but in summary their Honours Mclnerney and Crockett JJ. indicated that it was for a sentencing judge to evaluate a plea of guilty and having done so to give it such effect, if any, in reduction of sentence as he thought proper. Nothing in s4 renders that process unnecessary or inappropriate.  
         But their Honours went on to suggest, at pp 232-3, that pleas of guilty which are not designed to serve the public interest and in which the accused's self-interest is completely dominant and pleas of guilty to lesser offences than those originally charged as a result of ‘plea bargaining’ between the accused or his advisers and the Crown will not ordinarily weigh heavily in the accused's favour. This part of their Honours' judgment may be modified by the new section 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         The result of this consideration of the section is that a court may always take a plea of guilty into account in mitigation of sentence even though it is solely motivated by self-interest and even though it is a plea to lesser offences than those originally charged or intended to be charged. Doubtless, however, a plea of guilty which is indicative of remorse or of some other mitigating quality will ordinarily carry more weight than a plea dictated solely by self-interest. Nevertheless, Parliament having indicated, by the requirement that a court state the fact that it has reduced the sentence that it would otherwise have passed on account of a plea of guilty, that encouragement is to be given to pleas of guilty, such a plea should ordinarily be taken into account in the accused's favour. But nothing in this judgment should be taken as indicating a requirement that a court should pass a sentence that in all the circumstances it considers to be inappropriate.” [my emphasis] 
         
        
       
     47 Subsequent Victorian cases have reiterated the proposition that the legislation (subsequently re-enacted as s5(2)(e) of the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic)) was intended to “encourage pleas of guilty”. See R v Giakas [1988] VR 973 at 978; R v Hall (1994) 76 A Crim R 454 at 469-470). As Charles JA succinctly put it: “the State itself benefits from the guilty plea”. (R v Donnelly [1998] 1 VR 645 at 649. See also Fox & Freiberg Sentencing: State and Federal Law in Victoria (2nd ed) pars 3.814-3.815.) 
      
       
     48 The position in Victoria was altered by legislative intervention. In New South Wales, the Courts accepted that utilitarian considerations could be taken into account as such and not merely as a reflection of a subjective element. Hunt CJ at CL said in R v Winchester (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 at 350: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plea of guilty may also be taken into account as a factor in its own right independently of such contrition, as mitigation for the co-operation in saving the time and cost involved in a trial. Obviously enough, the extent to which leniency will be afforded upon this ground will depend to a large degree upon just when the plea of guilty was entered or indicated (and thus the savings effected).” 
         
        
       
     49 It was for this reason that his Honour said, with reference to s439 of the Crimes Act 1900, that that legislation “does no more than state what the law is” (350). I unhesitatingly accept his Honour’s statement of what the practice in this State was at the relevant time. I have not, however, been able to find an unambiguous statement of the utilitarian value of the plea earlier than his Honour’s own judgment in R v Paull (1990) 20 NSWLR 427 at 429. See also Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v EI Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 382; R v Laurentiu and Becheru (1992) 63 A Crim R 402 at 208. (In Cameron at [39] McHugh J identifies the development as one of “recent years”, referring to Winchester as the earliest authority.) 
      
       
     50 The New South Wales act states that a Court “must”, not “may”, take into account a plea. Furthermore, what is required to be taken into account is both “the fact” of the plea and “when” it was made. If a lesser penalty is not to be imposed then the Court must give reasons. 
      
       
     51 The statutory reference to “the fact” of the plea, as the matter required to be considered, does not direct attention to the subjective intention of the person pleading guilty. Nor, in my opinion, is the element of timing, reflected in the reference to ”when” a plea was made, a reference only to subjective elements. 
      
       
     52 The mandatory language of s22 must be followed whether or not by doing so the Court can be seen to “discriminate”, in the sense that word was used in the joint judgment in Cameron, against those who put the crown to proof. The Court must take the plea into account even if there is no subjective intention to facilitate the administration of justice. However, viewed objectively, there will always be actual, as distinct from intended, facilitation of the administration of justice by reason of “the fact” of the plea. The use of the word “must” and the reference to “the fact” of the plea, strongly suggest that the Parliament was not concerned only with subjective elements. The actual facilitation of the administration of justice was to be regarded as relevant by sentencing judges. 
      
       
     53 To use the language of the Full Court in R v Morton, the New South Wales Act does not expressly contain “any direction as to the purposes for which or the circumstances in which a plea of guilty may be taken into account”. However, there is no warrant for limiting such “purposes” or “circumstances” so as to restrict the Court’s attention to a subjective intention to assist the administration of justice, to the exclusion of the objective value of the plea. 
      
       
     54 By s34(1)(b)(i) of the Interpretation Act 1987, the Court may have regard to extrinsic material where a provision is “ambiguous or obscure”. It may be that the drafter used both words – “ambiguous or obscure” – because of the distinction between those two words drawn by one member of the House of Lords in a case where their Lordships were unanimous that a particular statutory provision was entirely unambiguous, but three Lords said the meaning was X and two said it was Y. (See Ellerman Lines Ltd v Murray [1931] AC 126 esp at 144 per Lord Blanesburgh. See Megarry A Second Miscellany-at-Law Stevens & Sons, London, 1973 pp179-180.) 
      
       
     55 The use of the expanded phrase “ambiguous or obscure” indicates that the Parliament did not intend to adopt a narrow definition of “ambiguous”. Not without irony, the word “ambiguous” may itself be used in different senses. ‘Ambiguity’ is not limited to lexical or verbal ambiguity and syntactic or grammatical ambiguity. It often extends to circumstances in which the meaning is, for whatever reason, doubtful. In my opinion, it does so extend in s34 of the Interpretation Act. 
      
       
     56 As the authors of the third edition of Cross on Statutory Interpretation state: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the context of statutory interpretation the word most frequently used to indicate the doubt which a judge must entertain before he can search for, and if possible, apply a secondary meaning is ‘ambiguity’. In ordinary language this term is often confined to situations in which the same word is capable of meaning two different things; but in relation to statutory interpretation, judicial usage sanctions the application of the word ‘ambiguity’ to describe any kind of doubtful meaning of words, phrases, or longer statutory provisions.” (R Cross,  
         Statutory Interpretation 
          3rd ed London, Butterworths, 1995, at 83-84.) 
         
        
       
     57 A similar broad approach of the concept of “ambiguity” is reflected in a judgment of Justice O’Connor in 1906, when his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It has been contended in this case that an ambiguity must appear on the face of a statute before you can apply he rules of interpretation relating to ambiguities. In one sense that is correct, and in another sense it is not. You will frequently find an Act of Parliament perfectly clear on the face of it, and it is only when you apply it to the subject matter that the ambiguity appears. That ambiguity arises frequently from the use of general words. And wherever general words are used in a statute there is always a liability to find a difficulty in applying general words to the particular case. It is often doubtful whether the legislature used the words in the general unrestricted sense, or in a restricted sense with reference to some particular subject matter.” ( 
         Bowtell v Goldsborough Mort & Co Ltd 
          (1905) 3 CLR 444 at 456-457.) 
         
        
        
       (See also  
       Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh 
        (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 287-288, with its reference to “a narrow conception of ambiguity”;  
       Repatriation Commission v Vietnam Veterans’ Association 
        (2000) 48 NSWLR 548 at [116].) 
        
       
     58 Accordingly, it is appropriate to have regard to extrinsic material, for purposes of construing s22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
      
       
     59 Second Reading Speeches are often unhelpful. Explanatory Memoranda are virtually always mere paraphrases. This, however, is an occasion on which the Second Reading Speech does assist in determining the scope of what is encompassed in “the fact” of the plea and of the significance of ”when” it was made. 
      
       
     60 The pertinence of utilitarian considerations was stated explicitly, and at length, in the Second Reading Speech for the amendments which introduced s439 into the Crimes Act 1900. 
      
       
     61 I have set out extracts from the speech in my judgment in Thomson at [7]-[9]. The essential part is also set out by McHugh J in Cameron at [40]. The relevance of utilitarian considerations was emphasised by the Attorney: 
      
       
     · “… even a minor change in a guilty plea has a significant effect on court time required. The guilty plea rate would therefore free up court time to deal with the backlog of cases awaiting hearing.” 
      
       
     · “… the police are not tied up in court for the length of a trial.” 
      
       
     · “Even when the Crown case is strong and a guilty plea may be thought to be inevitable, it will usually be appropriate to reduce the sentence to take account of the plea because the State has been saved the expense of a trial, witnesses have been spared the necessity of attending court and giving evidence, and police have been able to better carry out their duty of protecting the community.” 
      
       
     62 On the proper construction of s22 of the New South Wales Act, courts in this State are, in my opinion, permitted to take into account the objective utilitarian value of the plea. Until the High Court’s decision in Cameron, the Supreme Court of Western Australia had taken a similar view of that State’s legislation. It is, of course, perfectly possible that the effect of two similar, but not identical, statutes will differ. 
      
       
     63 The Sentencing Act 1995 (WA), under consideration in Cameron contains s7 and s8: 
      
       
        
         
         “7(1) Aggravating factors which, in the court’s opinion, increase the culpability o the offender. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) An offence is not aggravated by the fact that - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the offender pleaded not guilty to it; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the offender has a criminal record; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) a previous sentence has not achieved the purpose for which it was imposed. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (3) If the statutory penalty for an offence is greater if the offence is committed in certain circumstances than if it is committed without the existence of those circumstances, then - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) an offender is not liable the greater statutory penalty unless he or she has been charged and convicted of committing the offence in those circumstances; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) whether or not the offender was so charged, the existence of those circumstances may be taken into account as aggravating factors. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         8(1) Mitigating factors are factors which, in the court’s opinion, decrease the culpability of the offender or decrease the extent to which the offender should be punished. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) A plea of guilty by an offender is a mitigating factor and the earlier in proceedings that it is made, or indication is given that it will be made, the greater the mitigation. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) The fact that property derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by the offender, or that is subject to the effective control of the offender, as a result of the commission of the offence is forfeited to the Crown under a written law is not a mitigating factor. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) If because of a mitigating factor a court reduces the sentence it would otherwise have imposed on an offender, the court must state that fact in open court. 
         
        
        
         
         (5) If because an offender undertakes to assist law enforcement authorities a court reduces the sentence it would otherwise have imposed on the offender, the court must state that fact and the extent of the reduction in open court.” 
         
        
       
     64 In Cameron the Court had before it a case in which a plea had been entered under that State’s “fast track” system. It was submitted that the full reduction for a “fast track” plea should only be available where the prosecuting authorities had received the utilitarian benefit of not preparing the case. The Court said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[18] There would be force in that suggestion if s8(2) of the  
         Sentencing Act 
          were to be read in isolation from s7(2)(a) which gives effect to the common law rule that a person should not be penalised for exercising the right to trial. So, too, there would be force in the suggestion if the rationale for allowing a plea to be taken into account in mitigation were, to any extent, based on the objective consideration that the plea has resulted in the saving of court and prosecution time. 
         
        
        
         
         [19] Once it is appreciated that s8(2) of the  
         Sentencing Act 
          is to be reconciled with s7(2)(a), which gives effect to the common law requirement that an offender not be penalised for pleading not guilty, s8(2) must be read as allowing that a plea of guilty may be taken into account in mitigation for the reason that a guilty plea evidences a willingness to facilitate the course of justice and not simply because the plea saves the time and expense of those involved in the administration of criminal justice.” 
         
        
       
     65 Nothing in the New South Wales Act expressly or implicitly refers to the common law requirement to which their Honours refer. I do not doubt that the common law principle does apply in New South Wales. However, it is not a principle which must be invoked to construe s22 in the absence of any indication, unlike the Western Australian statute, that it is a pertinent restriction on the scope of the section. 
      
       
     66 In pars [12] and [13] of the joint judgment in Cameron, which I have quoted above, the Court referred to the subjective perspective of “willingness to facilitate the course of justice” as being required if the distinction between allowing a deduction for a guilty plea, and not penalising an offender for pleading not guilty, is “to be seen as non-discriminatory”. The Court relied on the principle of Aristotelian ethics that equals should be treated equally and persons who are not relevantly equal should not be treated equally. (See at [15] referring to Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd  v South Australia (1990) 169 CLR 436 at 480.) As the joint judgment said in Wong v The Queen at [65]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are  
         relevantly 
          identical. It requires  
         different 
           
         outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect.” 
         
        
       
     67 I do not understand the joint judgment in Cameron to have called into question the ability of a State Parliament to adopt a form of differentiation which may be, or at least may appear to be, discriminatory in the sense that word was used in the joint judgment. Insofar as that is the consequence of accepting that s22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 empowers the Courts of this State to give significant weight to the objective utilitarian value of a plea of guilty, then that consequence must be accepted if that is what the New South Wales Parliament has done. In my opinion, that is the case. 
      
       
     68 Although the legislation may have been regarded at the time as re-enacting the common law, as then understood in this State, the force of the relevant principle from that time was based on the statute rather than on the common law. Accordingly, when, in Cameron, the High Court came to restate the common law in a manner not consistent with what New South Wales judges had assumed that law to be, the statute continued to have full force and effect in accordance with its terms. That is what the statute requires. (See Giannarelli v Wraith (1988) 156 CLR 543 at 586.) In my opinion the reasoning in the joint judgment in Cameron does not apply in this State. Thomson should still be followed. 
      
       
        
       Merits of the Appeal 
        
       
     69 This crown appeal is based on the proposition that the sentence, particularly the non-parole period, is manifestly inadequate. The crown specifically challenges the combined discounts for the plea and the co-operation as excessive in all the circumstances. 
      
       
     70 There are well-known restraints on this Court intervening in the case of a crown appeal. In particular, the discretionary nature of the judgment reflected in the sentence is such that intervention on the ground of manifest inadequacy requires the Court to conclude that the sentence is so inadequate that there must have been some error of principle even though such error may not be apparent in the case of the reasons. 
      
       
     71 The crown drew attention to the sequence of steps that his Honour took to reach the final sentence. His Honour adopted a starting point of four years imprisonment. I do not understand the crown to be challenging the starting point and in my opinion, in the circumstances, it was appropriate. His Honour’s reasoning applied a discount of twenty-five percent for the plea, leading to a notional sentence of three years. Thereafter, his Honour applied a discount of fifty percent for co-operation with the authorities leading to a head sentence of eighteen months which is the head sentence he imposed. The combined effect was a discount of sixty-two and a half percent. Thereafter, his Honour found there to be special circumstances and varied the normal ratio, from three-quarters to two-thirds. 
      
       
     72 As I indicated in Thomson at [160], it will often be appropriate to combine any discount for a plea with a discount for assistance where both are pertinent. 
      
       
     73 The crown accepted that there should be a substantial discount for the guilty plea and also for the assistance, but that the end result was manifestly inadequate in that case. 
      
       
     74 Armed robberies of the character involved in the present proceedings, committed by young persons, generally with an addiction problem, are so prevalent that the objective of general deterrence is entitled to significant weight in the process of sentencing for this offence, notwithstanding the youth of the typical offender. (See R v Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135; R v Tran (1999) NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[11]; R v AEM Snr [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96]-[102].) 
      
       
     75 This Court has said on numerous occasions that persons who work alone in vulnerable circumstances - like receptionists in motels – must be protected in the public interest. The fear induced in the victim, who in this case was threatened by a person with a ten inch long knife reinforced by the aggravating circumstance of a second offender, is such that this Court must regard such offences as of significant gravity.  
      
       
     76 In the present case, the Respondent’s degree of criminality was lessened, particularly in comparison with his co-offender, because it was the co-offender who both proposed the offence, who came prepared with a weapon and who wielded the weapon during the offence. Nevertheless, the Respondent by his presence and assistance actively participated in the crime.  
      
       
     77 The subjective case presented on behalf of the Respondent was of moderate strength. The material before the Court suggested that he had ceased taking heroin but his attitude and behaviour did not otherwise suggest that his prospects of rehabilitation were high. His Honour based his finding that there was contrition only on the plea. There was no clear expression of remorse. The only matters capable of supporting a substantially reduced penalty were the utilitarian value of the plea and the assistance to authorities. His Honour identified both these matters and gave them substantial weight, as he was entitled to do. The issue before the Court is whether, probably by reason of giving those considerations excessive weight, the end result was manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     78 Counsel for the Respondent submitted that if the Court found error in the decision below, then it should exercise its residual discretion not to intervene. Specific reliance was placed on the fact that an increase in the non-parole period would operate particularly harshly, as the Respondent is within a few weeks of the expiration of that period. 
      
       
     79 In this respect the Respondent relied on an affidavit, in which he outlined that he had spent time in the harsher circumstances of protective custody and that threats were made against him, because some inmates had discovered that he had been on protection. The Respondent referred to his continued preparedness to assist the crown in the trial of his co-offender. The Court was informed that the trial of the co-offender would occur in the near future.  
      
       
     80 In his affidavit the Respondent indicated that he has conducted himself in a positive way in prison: completing a seven week welding course and working as a fulltime groundsman outside the Correction Centre. He also said that he has completed a drug and alcohol course and has remained drug free in prison and intends to remain drug free. 
      
       
     81 I take these considerations into account but, nevertheless, I believe the Court should exercise its discretion to intervene.  
      
       
     82 In my opinion, accepting the restraints on intervention by this Court on a crown appeal, I am of the view that the end result was manifestly inadequate and particularly so with respect to the non-parole period. I am also of the opinion that his Honour gave an excessive discount of sixty-two and a half percent for the combination of the plea and the assistance. 
      
       
     83 Having regard to all the circumstances which I have outlined above, in my opinion the minimum sentence that ought to have been imposed by his Honour was a sentence of two years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. But for the plea and the promise of assistance to authorities a sentence of four years would have been imposed. 
      
       
     84 For the reasons I discussed in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [54]-[65], a sentencing judge must consider, when determining the non-parole period, what should be the minimum period of actual incarceration in all the circumstances of the offence of the offender. Nothing in the matters put before the Court suggest that there are “special circumstances” of such significance as would justify varying the usual ratio to the degree that would reduce the period of actual incarceration below eighteen months. In the event, the period of six months of supervision on parole is the same as that proposed in his Honour’s orders. 
      
       
     85 The orders I propose are: 
      
       
        
         
         1 Crown Appeal allowed. 
          
          
         2 Quash the sentence imposed by Woods DCJ. 
          
          
         3 Impose a sentence of two years imprisonment commencing on 4 May 2001 and expiring on 3 May 2003, with a non-parole period of eighteen months expiring on 3 November 2002 when the Respondent is to be released to parole.

     2 Mason P: I agree with Barr J. 
      
       
     3 Barr J: The applicant, Rodney William Cook, applies for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court following his plea of guilty to the charge that on 21 May 1998 at Quakers Hill he drove a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which grievous bodily harm was occasioned. By s 52A(3) Crimes Act the maximum penalty prescribed for that offence is imprisonment for seven years. Payne DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for one year and ten months and fixed a non-parole period of twelve months. 
      
       
     4 The facts were as follows. The applicant and a friend were drinking at the Marayong Hotel. They left the hotel just after 6:00pm on Thursday 21 May 1998 and travelled in the applicant’s car towards Quakers Hill. The applicant was driving. During the course of the journey the applicant drove along Railway Road Quakers Hill where the speed limit was sixty kilometres per hour. He drove his car at a speed at a little under one hundred kilometres per hour. The vehicle came into collision with the rear of a slow-moving car driven by Mrs Marta Puchalska. Mrs Puchalska’s car had just reversed out of a parking place beside the road. The impact pushed Mrs Puchalska’s car into collision with a third vehicle. She suffered serious head injuries, brain damage, a ruptured spleen and a fractured pelvis. She was taken to Westmead hospital and kept there in intensive care, undergoing surgery for her head injuries. After that she was transferred to the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit and after that underwent intensive rehabilitation including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology and rehabilitation nursing. She was eventually allowed to go home and reached a condition in which she was able to do most things for herself. However, she is now permanently incapacitated, unable to work and requires assistance and supervision in her daily and home tasks. She has poor memory, poor organisational and problem-solving skills, poor initiation and poor temper control and suffers from fatigue and depression. She was fifty-four years of age at the time of the collision.  
      
       
     5 After the collision the applicant ran away but before long he went in distress to the police station and told an officer that he was responsible. He said that he had been driving at one hundred kilometres per hour.  
      
       
     6 Blood was taken for testing and was found to contain 0.052 grams per 100 millilitres of blood. The applicant was charged with the offence of which he was eventually convicted. He did not take the opportunity to plead guilty to the charge, however, when it was preferred in the Local Court. Later on the Director of Public Prosecutions took over the conduct of the case and charged the applicant under s 52A(4) with the offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm. The maximum penalty for that offence is eleven years’ imprisonment. The aggravation relied on was that the applicant was exceeding the speed limit by more than forty-five kilometres per hour. He was committed to the District Court for trial on that charge. 
      
       
     7 In the District Court the Crown indicated that it was prepared to accept a plea of guilty to the offence under subs (3) and the applicant forthwith entered that plea.  
      
       
     8 Her Honour noted that although the applicant had not pleaded guilty at the first opportunity he had done so on his first arraignment in the District Court and as soon as the Crown indicated in that Court that it was prepared to accept a conviction of the unaggravated form of the offence. Referring to R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, her Honour decided to reduce the sentence by 17% to allow for the utilitarian value of the plea.  
      
       
     9 Her Honour noted that the Crown case was strong, though assisted by the applicant’s voluntary remarks to the police, to which he adhered in the District Court. Her Honour noted the high speed at which the applicant was driving. She accepted the genuineness of his contrition. Then, referring to R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, her Honour noted a number of features categorised in that case as relevant to sentencing in an offence of this kind and present in this case. They were the extent of the injuries inflicted, the number of persons put at risk, the degree of speed of the vehicle and the length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. Her Honour stated that although this was not an example of momentary inattention or misjudgment she was not prepared to say in all the circumstances that the degree of speed represented an abandonment by the applicant of his responsibility, although it was very close to such an abandonment. 
      
       
     10 In making those observations her Honour was referring to the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Jurisic at 231 in which his Honour observed that the presence of factors by which the conduct of an offender might be assessed (here excessive speed) might lead to the conclusion that an offender had abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. When such a factor could be so described then it could be said to be present to a material degree for the purposes of determining an appropriate sentence. Such a conclusion would attract the application of the guidelines set forth in his Honour’s judgment. 
      
       
     11 Having observed that the applicant’s case presented a serious example of the behaviour made criminal under s 52A(3) her Honour said that a conclusion that there had been no abandonment of responsibility did not mean that a full-time custodial sentence was not appropriate. Her Honour was undoubtedly right about that because an independent factor bearing on sentence was the degree of resulting harm. In due course her Honour explained why she thought that nothing less than the imposition of a full-time custodial sentence would be appropriate. 
      
       
     12 Her Honour noted the subjective features of the applicant’s case. I have already referred to his contrition. He was twenty-one years eight months of age at the time of the collision and twenty-four years and ten months of age when sentenced. He had no prior criminal record and had a good work history. He had substantial support in the community and a settled home life. Her Honour thought him highly unlikely ever to drive in such a fashion again, notwithstanding his record of three prior offences for exceeding the speed limit. Her Honour thought that his record did not disentitle him to some leniency.  
      
       
     13 Her Honour observed that a reduction of about 10% would be appropriate for the late plea of guilty, referring to R v Thomson and Houlton. Her Honour then constructed a sentence, starting at two years but increasing that term by 10% to two years and four months on the assumption that the two year R v Thomson and Houlton starting point incorporated a 10% reduction for a plea of guilty, and then deducted the 17% I have already mentioned to take account of the utilitarian considerations of the plea of guilty. So a sentence of twenty-two months was arrived at.  
      
       
     14 A number of attacks were made on appeal about the principles employed in the formulation of the sentence and about the precise manner of its calculation.  
      
       
     15 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that her Honour erred in her reference to R v Jurisic and what was said to be her purported application of the principles set forth therein. It was submitted that R v Jurisic should not be followed, first because it had been implicitly disapproved by the High Court of Australia in Wong and Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64 and secondly because the judgment was fundamentally flawed for various reasons articulated in the written submissions.  
      
       
     16 Then it was submitted, assuming that the Jurisic guidelines had validity, that her Honour was wrong, in view of her failure to find an abandonment of responsibility, to refer to the guidelines at all as justifying her starting point of two years. It was submitted that if a starting point was appropriate it should be considerably less than two years. It was submitted that increasing the two year period by 10% wrongly assumed that a starting point suggested in R v Jurisic contained a built-in R v Thomson and Houlton discount of 10%. Her Honour’s mathematical calculations were criticised and were said to illustrate the dangers inherent in a “two-tiered” approach to sentencing, which was wrong. 
      
       
     17 Attention was drawn to the favourable findings of her Honour and to the subjective features favouring leniency. The submission may be taken to have been that the length of the sentence itself manifested error, her Honour having stopped short of a conclusion that the applicant had abandoned his responsibility. 
      
       
     18 To my mind this appeal does not give rise to the need to reconsider the principles set forth in R v Jurisic, whether by reference to Wong and Leung v The Queen or otherwise. Neither is it necessary in my view to make any final determination about the manner in which her Honour calculated the head sentence of one year ten months. Her Honour’s calculations contain one patent error, namely an increase by one-tenth, rather than one-ninth, to allow for an assumed prior discount of one-tenth. But this is a minor matter. Assuming in favour of the applicant that her Honour erred in every submitted respect it does not seem to me that this Court would be justified in setting aside the sentence and substituting any lesser sentence. Notwithstanding the respectable subjective case the applicant was able to put forward, the manner of his driving and the tragic results amounted in my opinion to a very serious case of the type contemplated by s 52A(3). 
      
       
     19 It seems to me that driving at a speed close to 100 kilometres per hour in a sixty kilometres per hour zone in the vicinity of a railway station where cars and pedestrians might be expected to be moving about was highly dangerous. The day was a Thursday and it was a little after 6:00pm. Numerous people might be expected to be leaving the railway station on their way home from work. It was well after sunset. In my opinion the conclusion that the applicant had not abandoned his responsibility for his conduct was not open to her Honour. The high degree of dangerousness of the applicant’s driving combined with the grave injury caused to Mrs Puchalska to make it necessary to impose a substantial custodial sentence. In my opinion the sentence imposed was lenient. 
      
       
     20 Insofar as the applicant’s submissions proceeded on the assumption that any demonstration of error obliged this Court to interfere and impose a lesser sentence they were not in accordance with the jurisdiction exercised by this Court. Notwithstanding any demonstration of error, the Court must dismiss an appeal against sentence unless it comes to the view that a less severe sentence is warranted in law. This is the effect of ss5(1)(c) and 6(3), Criminal Appeal Act, reading down the latter subsection in accordance with Neal v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 305. See also R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 in the judgment of Spigelman CJ at paras 74-79. 
      
       
     21 In my opinion no sentence less than a head sentence of one year ten months is warranted in this case. In my opinion no non-parole period of less than twelve months is warranted. I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Daniel James Ezold comes before the Court charged with contempt in the face of the Court constituted by his wilful refusal to take an oath or affirmation and to give evidence.  
     
      
    2 He was originally to be tried jointly with a co-offender, Jason Farrell, for murder. For reasons which are no longer relevant, the trials were separated. The offender, Mr Ezold, was tried first, convicted and sentenced. He was sentenced just a few days before the trial of Farrell commenced. The Crown intended to call him to give evidence at the trial of Farrell. It was apparent even then, however, that Mr Ezold had already told the Crown that he did not intend to give evidence.3 The matter was raised again during debate on his sentence and I drew attention to it in the remarks I made when sentencing him. I said on 20 February this year that his reluctance to give evidence in the forthcoming trial did not cause me to doubt conclusions I had reached about the prospects of his rehabilitation.4 The trial of Farrell proceeded and Mr Ezold was called to give evidence. On 22 February 2002 he was asked to stand in the witness box. He was handed the bible and the oath was administered. He did not respond. He was then twice invited to respond to the words of the solemn affirmation. He did not respond.  
     
      
    5 This exchange then followed - 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Ezold, the affirmation has been read to you and you have twice been invited to respond. Respond by saying I do. You’ve said nothing. Did you understand what was being read to you? 
        
       
       
        
      EZOLD: Yes. 
       
       
        
      HIS HONOUR: Is your failure to respond deliberate? 
       
       
        
      EZOLD: Yes. 
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Am I to take it that you do not wish to give evidence in this matter? 
        
       
       
        
      EZOLD: Yes. 
       
       
      
     HIS HONOUR: Am I to take it that you refuse to give evidence in this matter? 
     
      
       
        
      EZOLD: Yes. 
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Do you understand that if you refuse to give evidence, you may be dealt with by the court for contempt of court? 
        
       
       
        
      EZOLD: Yes. 
       
       
        
      HIS HONOUR: Do you think you ought to get some legal advice about this? 
       
       
        
      EZOLD: No. 
      
     
     
      
    6 The matter concerned me and I sought the assistance of the Crown Prosecutor as to what might be done. I gave an opportunity to counsel then appearing for Farrell to say something about the matter. I told Mr Ezold that he was a person in my opinion who was compellable to give evidence in the trial and I directed that he should do so. I asked him whether he understood and he said that he did. The affirmation was then administered to him a third time and he still did not respond. 
     
      
    7 Some minutes later I said this - 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Ezold, I said no more to you than that you might be dealt with for contempt. If you were dealt with for contempt of the court, that would be after an inquiry whether you were adjudged guilty of contempt of court. That inquiry would be made by me. If I adjudged you guilty of contempt of court, I would have the power to impose a sentence of imprisonment on you. So far as I’m aware, there is no limit to the length of the sentence that I could impose. 
        
       
      
    8 Mr Ezold was well aware of what he would face if he continued to refuse to give evidence. There was still a chance for him to change his mind and it was convenient to adjourn this question until the following day. I did that because what I might term the point of no return in the Crown case had not yet arrived. On the following sitting day and Mr Ezold again confirmed his attitude. 
     
      
    9 The matter was then adjourned so that the trial could proceed. When Mr Ezold was called up the matter was adjourned again so that his solicitor could follow up an application for a grant of legal aid. It is the pursuance of the grant which has in part explained the delay that has taken place between the events and today's proceedings. It is a matter of some satisfaction for the Court that there has been a grant of aid and the Court has received assistance from Mr Craigie of Senior Counsel, Deputy Senior Public Defender. The Court has been fortunate also in receiving the assistance of the Crown Advocate, Mr Cogswell of Senior Counsel. 
     
      
    10 At the commencement of proceedings today, Mr Craigie announced that he had read a transcript of the proceedings and that the contempt was admitted.  
     
      
    11 Counsel made submissions about the law pertaining to the matter. I need refer only to a small number of cases. 
     
      
    12 In Registrar of Court of Appeal v Gilby, an unreported decision of the Court of Appeal delivered on 20 August 1991, the Court dealt with the seriousness of the circumstances attending a person's refusal to give evidence. Their Honours said this: 
     
      
       
        
        A person who, when properly before the Court to give evidence, refuses to be sworn or to give evidence when he should is prima facie guilty of a breach of the law. In general terms, the law requires that a person give evidence in circumstances such as the present. Justice is administered for the benefit of the community and there is, in general, an obligation upon the members of the community to do what is required for that purpose. The offence which is committed by a refusal to do so is conventionally described and dealt with under the heading 'Contempt of Court'. It is, more accurately, to be seen as the failure to discharge the obligation which a person owes as a member of the community or because he is within it. 
        
       
       
      Their Honours said at page 26 of the same judgment: 
       
       
        
        If in a criminal proceeding a person refuses to give evidence when he should, he causes harm to other persons in his community: at least they are liable to suffer harm because of what he has done. It is, as we have suggested, a requirement of the law that, in general, a person gives evidence when properly called upon to do so, in order that criminals may be convicted. If criminals are not going to be convicted, they are less likely to be pursued and arrested. And, if they are not to be pursued or arrested, then the individual members of the community will suffer from what criminals will do. 
        
       
       
      Their Honours went on to deal with the seriousness of the consequences attendant upon a refusal to give evidence in a criminal case. 
       
      
    13 In Smith v The Queen (1991) 25 NSWLR 1 Kirby P said this: 
     
      
       
        
        These are good reasons for adhering to the rule that to refuse to be sworn (or to affirm) or to give evidence such as occurred here amounts to a serious contempt in the face of the court. It is serious because courts decide cases on the basis of evidence. If evidence is unjustifiably withheld, the administration of justice is impeded. 
        
       
       
      and his Honour there referred to a portion of the judgment in 
       Registrar Court of Appeal v Gilby 
      . 
       
       
      
    14 A number of relevant matters arise for consideration when dealing with an offence of this kind. They were conveniently brought together by Dunford J in Wood v Staunton (No 5) (1995) 86 A Crim R 183. At 185 his Honour listed ten circumstances. The list is not exhaustive though it is comprehensive and it is convenient to deal with this matter by reference to it.15 The first is the seriousness of the contempt proved. It seems to me that the contempt here was serious, and I refer in that respect to the remarks of the members of the Court of Appeal in Gilby. It is a serious matter when persons refuse to give evidence in criminal cases because it strikes at the administration of justice.16 The second matter is whether the contemnor was aware of the consequences to him and of what he did. It is clear from the passages of the transcript which I have read that Mr Ezold was aware of those matters.17 The third consideration is the actual consequences of the contempt. Farrell was convicted in due course. Furthermore, his case at trial was not that he did not do the act causing death - that was admitted from the start - but that he lacked the specific intent necessary for murder because of the effects upon him of alcohol and an illegal drug. It may be that Mr Ezold might have been able to say something about the appearance of Farrell so as to inform the jury about the effect, if any, upon Farrell of those drugs. It was equally obvious before the trial began that the Crown's principal intent in calling Mr Ezold to give evidence was, if the occasion should arise, to cross-examine him and put in his hand an incriminating letter he wrote to a friend setting out the activities of himself and Farrell. The Crown I expect would have put to Mr Farrell in detail, if permitted, the details of what he had there written that Farrell had done.18 Although the refusal to give evidence had very serious potential consequences, it has to be said in all the circumstances that the actual consequences were not serious and might not even have existed.19 The next consideration is whether the contempt was committed in the context of serious crime. Here it was. Murder is the most serious crime with which the Court routinely deals.20 The next consideration is the reason for the contempt. This is a matter attended by a little difficulty in the present case. I have already referred to the submissions made to the Court well before these events that Farrell had no intention of giving evidence for the Crown.21 During debate on Mr Ezold's sentence, mention was made from the Bar table about a fear that Mr Ezold had of consequences for his family if he gave evidence. When the matter was before me on 22 February Mr Ezold was asked why he was taking the attitude he was but he refused to answer the question.  
     
      
    22 Today there has been put before the Court a report of Anna Robilliard, a psychologist. It sets out a history of Mr Ezold, himself and his life, and of the offence, and proffers some reasons why Mr Ezold refused to give evidence. It says that he was sentenced on 20 February and that two days later was placed in the witness box. At the time he was trying to deal with the sentence he had just received. The report goes on to say that he had been expecting to be found not guilty. The ordeal of his own trial left him reluctant to become involved in that of Farrell and it was painful for him, as it is put, ""to be stripped to the bone"". He felt that he needed to keep a piece of himself and was ill-equipped to stand appearing at another trial so quickly.  
     
      
    23 I should say that Mr Ezold was tried late in the previous year and that quite a long time, quite a number of weeks, went by between the time that the jury found him guilty and the time of sentence.24 It is not easy to understand the relevance of the remark that Mr Ezold fully expected to be found not guilty. He was advised by counsel throughout and could not but have expected a sentence of approximately the kind ultimately imposed. Miss Robilliard reports that in addition to his psychological and emotional conditions Mr Ezold said that he was frightened to give evidence against his co-accused as he knew the prison culture and the attitudes of prisoners to ""dogs"". He also said he would be in custody for the next 12 years of his life and did not want to live in fear all the time. He said that he had no particular fears of Farrell but that he did generally fear the prison population.25 There appears to have been a change in the attributed reason for Mr Ezold's refusal to give evidence. The strong and overbearing attitude of Farrell was drawn to the Court's attention. There is no doubt that he had an influence on Mr Ezold in the course of the principal offence. The difficulty is to know whether the originally expressed fear has any part to play in the reasons why Mr Ezold decided not to give evidence, whether it is that fear or whether, as he said through Miss Robilliard, he has no particular fear of Farrell.26 I can well understand that a person embarking on a long prison sentence would be very apprehensive about being known within the prison population as a willing informer. Mr Craigie has put forward two monographs of the Australian Institute of Criminology saying something about the rate of mortality of such persons. The monographs are of no direct assistance, not least because Mr Ezold was not aware of them, but it is well understood, and I accept, that prison is a dangerous place, especially for a young man who is likely to be housed with others who have committed violent offences and especially if the young man has the kind of reputation which Mr Ezold was, I think, concerned not to have.27 Ultimately it may not matter precisely what Mr Ezold's reasons were. I am comfortably satisfied that they were grounded in a fear that he would suffer retribution if he gave evidence.28 The next relevant consideration is the character and antecedents of the contemnor. As the Crown Advocate has pointed out, he comes for punishment as a person convicted of murder. It is not irrelevant, however, that before his conviction he was a man of good character with, I think, only one minor offence concerning an aberration with alcohol.29 The final two matters are general and personal deterrence and denunciation. General deterrence and denunciation are important because the message must go out that there will be serious consequences for people who refuse to abide by their obligations to society to act appropriately in the criminal justice system. I think that there is little or no consideration of personal deterrence in this matter. Mr Ezold faces a long non-parole period for the murder of which he has been convicted. It seems unlikely that those circumstances will repeat themselves.30 There is one other matter that I was invited by Mr Craigie to take into account and that is that this case is distinguishable from the situation in which a contemnor does what he does by way of complicity with an offender or for benefit, or, having received a benefit for a promise to give evidence, turns back on that promise. I think that the submission is well made and I think that for that reason this contempt was not as serious as many.  
     
      
    31 I take into account the fear with which Mr Ezold was faced, and I take into account that it was not his desire necessarily to frustrate the legal process. Having said that, I am satisfied that he was well aware that that might be the result of his actions.32 I think that it is necessary to impose a sentence of full time imprisonment and that no lesser sentence would give effect to the need for general deterrence and retribution and to bring home to the public the seriousness of offences like this one. I am also aware that the ordinary principles of sentencing apply and that I am imposing this sentence in conjunction with a 12 year non-parole period.33 I think that it is appropriate, having in mind the total criminality of the two offences, to impose a sentence which is partly concurrent with and partly cumulative upon the non-parole period of the existing sentence. My intention is to impose a six month sentence which overlaps the non-parole period by three months and results in Mr Ezold serving three further months before he becomes eligible for release on parole. 
     
      
       
       
      
    34 Daniel James Ezold I find you guilty of contempt of Court. I sentence you to imprisonment for a period of six months commencing on 19 August 2012 and expiring on 18 February 2013. Because the whole of that sentence will be served within the non-parole period and the parole period of the sentence which you are now serving, I decline to set a non-parole period.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: On 2 October 2001, the appellant was indicted before her Honour Judge Backhouse QC at the Sydney District Court on the following charge: 
      
       
        
         
         That he on 17 July 1998 at Punchbowl in the State of New South Wales did tamper with and assist in the disposal of a car, registration number VFU 560,  
         with intent 
          to hinder the discovery of evidence concerning a serious indictable offence committed by a person or persons unknown. (s. 315(1)  
         Crimes Act 1900 
         , maximum penalty: imprisonment for 7 years). (Emphasis added). 
         
        
       
     2 The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before her Honour and a jury of twelve. On 5 October 2001 the jury returned a verdict of guilty. 
      
       
     3 He now appeals against the conviction, but not against the sentence which was imposed, of imprisonment for a term of 12 months, with a non-parole period of 6 months. 
      
       
        
       FACTS 
        
       
     4 On 17 July 1998, the occupants of a red Mitsubishi station wagon, registration number VFU 560, became involved in an altercation with three men outside the Five Dock Hotel. One of the occupants of the vehicle, said to be Michael Kanaan, produced a firearm and fired a number of shots in their direction. As a result, two of the men died and the other was injured. After the shots were fired the vehicle was driven away from the scene. Its registration number was recorded by a bystander, and a police search for it was immediately commenced. 
      
       
     5 A witness, given the pseudonym Alan Rossini, was called in the Crown case. He had been given an immunity in relation to certain drug charges, and an undertaking that the evidence that he gave in this trial would not be used against him, unless it was false. 
      
       
     6 Rossini said that he had been seated in the front passenger seat of the vehicle, of which Shadi Derbas was the driver. Michael Kanaan, he said, was seated in the rear of the vehicle with Bassim Kazzi and a “young Lebanese guy”.  
      
       
     7 There was an altercation he said, between the occupants of the car outside the Five Dock Hotel, in the course of which he had a fist fight and lost his mobile phone. Kanaan, he said, fired shots at the three men. Bassim Kazzi, he said, was also involved in a fight, and received a hit in the mouth.  
      
       
     8 Rossini said that as they drove from the scene of the shooting, to Telopea Street Punchbowl, Derbas made two telephone calls on his mobile phone. He heard him say, “turn the scanner on and see if my car’s come up and call me back”. 
      
       
     9 Next, Rossini said, when they reached the address in Punchbowl which he believed was that of Derbas’ parents, the vehicle was driven through the driveway, towards the back of the house. He said that as they pulled into Telopea Street, Derbas and Kanaan had each given instructions not to speak to anyone about what had happened. Rossini agreed that there was no subsequent conversation in relation to anyone having been shot.  
      
       
     10 When he and the other occupants left the vehicle, there were a number of other persons present, who were standing it its near vicinity. They included Mohamed Dib, the appellant (who he referred to as “Sam Erdit” or “Little Erdit”), “Slow George” (Khouri) and a few other “Telopea Street Boys”. Durbas, he said, remarked “the car’s come up on the scanner”, and gave directions for it to be moved into the carport as there were already helicopters in the air. Additionally, he gave instructions to “two young Lebanese guys to go down to the end of the street to look out for D’s”. 
      
       
     11 Rossini said that the car was moved a couple of metres. Derbas told “Slow George” to get some cans of degreaser. When he returned, Derbas said “I can’t lose the car; we’ll just have to degrease it to get rid of fingerprints and saliva”.  
      
       
     12 Rossini said that he, the appellant, and a “Lebanese guy” sprayed the inside and outside surfaces of the vehicle with the aerosol degreaser. The appellant, he said, pulled out a seat belt and sprayed and wiped it. While this was happening, he said another “big guy” broke the steering lock of the car. He believed that Dib was using a screwdriver to tamper with the door locks to the vehicle.  
      
       
     13 After 10 to 15 minutes of this work, Rossini said, Derbas instructed “Slow George” to take the car to Roselands and dump it. The appellant was directed to follow “Slow George” in the latter’s van. They were to ring once they had dumped the car. Rossini said that he saw “Slow George” get into the Mitsubishi and the appellant walk down the side of the house. He added that he, Kanaan and Derbas waited for 5 or 10 minutes until Derbas received a phone call, after which he said “it was done”. 
      
       
     14 Rossini said that he had known the appellant for approximately 12 months and had met him many times over that period. The appellant in his evidence acknowledged knowing him and the other persons mentioned in Rossini’s evidence.  
      
       
     15 On 18 July 1998 the vehicle was discovered in the driveway of a property at Roselands. Examination of it revealed a strong odour consistent with that of degreasing chemicals, along with damage to the near side external door lock and to the ignition barrel and casing. An oily type substance was found covering the internal vinyl trim and windows of the vehicle. The damage to the vehicle was however not such as to permit entry to it or a starting of the engine, without the use of a key.  
      
       
     16 The appellant gave evidence in which he denied any involvement with the vehicle, and said that while he could not recall precisely where he had been on 17 July 1998, he knew that he had not been to Telopea Street that day. He was living at that time at Bidwill, a fact confirmed by Leanne Auon and Sheryl El-Zeyat, each of whom gave evidence to that effect, but neither of whom could recall where he had been that day. 
      
       
     17 The appellant suggested that Rossini had a motive to lie, in that in about August or September 1998 he had been involved in a sexual liaison with Rossini’s then girlfriend Sandra, at Kings Cross where she worked as a stripper. He thought that Rossini had discovered the affair and could remember being confronted by him in relation to it somewhere in the city, probably in late December. He said that after he provided an explanation, Rossini’s response was “sweet, no worries” after which he left. 
      
       
     18 Rossini disagreed with the suggestion the he had learned of any such affair, or that he had confronted Rossini with it. The appellant’s wife said that she had no knowledge of it, and did not believe it. Rossini additionally said that a similar “motive” had been put to him by another person charged with a quite separate offence, involving the murder of Edward Lee, when he gave evidence in relation to that matter – the single difference being the proposition, on this occasion, that it was this other accused who had been engaged in an affair with his girlfriend. 
      
       
     19 On 7 February 2000, Rossini took part in an identification procedure, in the course of which he was shown a video containing photographs of a number of people, including the appellant. He identified the appellant as a person “involved in discarding the vehicle”, later adding that “this person took that car that was used in the incident”. He described the vehicle at this stage as “a station wagon, late model, the colour of the car maroony”. 
      
       
     20 Rossini’s reliability and credibility was heavily attacked at the trial, in the light of inconsistencies in the several accounts which he had given, and in the light of the undertaking and/or immunity which he had in relation to the shootings, and in relation to a serious drug offence. However, there was some evidence corroborative, at least of his presence at the time of the shootings, so far as a mobile telephone registered to him was found at the scene.  
      
       
        
       GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
        
        
       Ground 1 – The Elements of the Offence 
        
       
     21 In the present case, it was beyond question, assuming that Rossini’s evidence was to be accepted, that the accused knew or had reasonable grounds for believing that some offence had been committed, and that it probably was a particularly serious offence. That arises by reason of the flurry of activity which could only have been designed to remove incriminating evidence, the reference to the vehicle having come up on the scanner and to helicopters being in the air, to the posting of lookouts to warn of detectives entering the street, and the disposal of the vehicle. 
      
       
     22 At the close of the Crown case, an application was made for a directed verdict of acquittal, upon the basis that the Crown had not proved that the appellant had known that the person or persons unknown, referred to in the charge, had committed any particular offence. 
      
       
     23 It was accepted by reason of s 313 of the Crimes Act, that the Crown did not have to prove that the appellant knew that the offence had been a “serious indictable” offence. However, it was the defence case at trial, and upon appeal, that it was an essential element of the offence of which the appellant was charged, that he be shown to have been aware of a specific primary offence (being one which in fact amounted to a serious indictable offence) having been committed, and to have tampered with the vehicle with the intention of hindering the discovery of evidence concerning that offence.  
      
       
     24 The application for a directed verdict was dismissed, without any reasons being given. The point raised has relevance for this ground of appeal – in so far as it is maintained that the trial judge erred in not directing an acquittal. It also has relevance for the second ground of appeal – so far as it is submitted that the verdict cannot be supported on the evidence, there being no evidence to show an awareness on the appellant’s part of the fact that the vehicle had been used in a shooting. 
      
       
     25 The charge was preferred under s 315 of the Crimes Act 1900, and carries with it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. That section is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         315 
          (1) A person who does anything intending in any way to hinder: 
          
           
            
             
             ( 
             a) the investigation of a serious indictable offence committed by another person, or  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (b) the discovery of evidence concerning a serious indictable offence committed by another person, or 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (c) the apprehension of another person who has committed a serious indictable offence,

           (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person is to be considered to have committed a serious indictable offence if a public officer engaged in the detection or investigation of offenders suspects on reasonable grounds that a person has committed the offence. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (3) ... 
           ” 
           
          
         
        
       
     26 By s 313, it is provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “If it is an element of an offence under this Part that an offence is a serious indictable offence, it is not necessary for the prosecution to establish that the accused knew that  
         the 
          offence was a serious indictable offence. 
         ” (Emphasis added). 
         
        
       
     27 A serious indictable offence is defined in s 4 of the Crimes Act as an indictable offence which is punishable by imprisonment for life, or for a term of 5 years or more. The primary offences in this matter clearly qualified as such. 
      
       
     28 The directions which were given by the trial judge as to the elements of the offence charged in this case were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Members of the jury, there are two elements in the offence. One, is the act in this case. The allegation is more than one act, but there is the act which it is alleged the accused did on this occasion, that is on 17 July 1998. The second element is that he intended on that occasion to hinder the discovery of evidence concerning a serious indictable offence committed by a person or persons unknown. They are the two elements of which you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before you would find the accused guilty of the offence.” 
         
        
       
     29 Having given this direction, her Honour identified the several circumstances upon which the Crown relied in support of the second element, that is the intention to hinder the discovery of evidence concerning the primary offence, which it was required to prove. Earlier, when summarising the evidence of Mr Rossini, she had identified the serious indictable offence involved as “the shooting outside the hotel”.  
      
       
     30 The circumstances from which the mental element was to be inferred were identified as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         …namely, that the accused was present at the address in Telopea Street, Punchbowl, on the evening of 17 July 1998, when the vehicle VFU 560 then being driven by Mr Derbas arrived back at that address in Punchbowl. 
         
        
        
         
         Secondly, that the accused did the acts alleged by the Crown, that is participating in the degreasing of the vehicle and then leaving that address on the direction of Mr Derbas. 
         
        
        
         
           
         Thirdly, that the vehicle had come on the scanner, that helicopters were present, that when the car first arrived back, Mr Derbas directed the two young guys to go down to the end of the street to look out for the D’s, … 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         and asks you to infer that the vehicle was involved in  
         a serious offence 
          on 17 July 1998. Also that the accused was aware that  
         a serious offence 
          had been committed and in complying with the directions of Mr Derbas, he had the intention to hinder the discovery of evidence concerning  
         a serious offence 
          committed by person or persons unknown 
         .” (Summing Up at 9 and 10) (Emphasis added). 
         
        
       
     31 After further directions as to the fact finding role of the jury, the drawing of inferences, and the use of circumstantial evidence her Honour repeated the matters upon which the Crown relied as circumstantial proof of the appellant’s intention (Summing Up pages 17-18), observing: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         It is from these facts… the Crown asks you to infer that the vehicle was involved in  
         a 
           
         serious indictable offence 
          on the evening of 17 July 1998, that the accused was aware that  
         a 
           
         serious offence 
          had been committed, and that complying with the directions of Mr Derbas he had the intention to hinder the discovery of evidence concerning  
         a 
           
         serious offence 
          committed by a person or persons unknown.” 
          (Emphasis added).  
         
        
       
     32 There was no further direction given in relation to any particular state of knowledge which the appellant needed to have concerning the primary offence, save that when dealing with the Crown submissions, her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         So far as the communications between the persons back at the address at Telopea Street, her submission to you is that it was very much on a need to know basis, and that the accused knew there had been  
         an offence 
         . Her submission to you was that there was no other explanation except the car was used in that kind of offence.” 
          (Emphasis added). 
         
        
        
       The “ 
       kind of offence 
       ” referred to in the concluding sentence in this paragraph was not further identified. Nor was there any direction given as to whether the Crown needed to show an awareness of the commission of a  
       particular 
        offence, or an awareness of the commission of  
       some 
        offence, the details or nature of which were unknown to the appellant.  
        
       
     33 There was no complaint about the directions which were given. However, it may be accepted that the relevant point had been taken at the time of the application for a directed verdict, it being implicit, in its dismissal, that her Honour did not consider it necessary for the Crown to establish an awareness or knowledge of the precise offence or offences which had been committed, the discovery of evidence concerning which, the appellant intended by his acts to hinder.  
      
       
     34 That was the position which the Crown had adopted at trial, and maintained on the appeal. In that regard, it submitted that identification of the primary offence was a particular of the charge and not an essential element of it.  
      
       
     35 It was accepted by the appellant that the Crown did not have to prove that he had known who had in fact committed the shooting. The terms of s 315(2) would support such a concession, although they would also permit the Crown to name, in the indictment, the person who was, on reasonable grounds, suspected by the public officer referred to in the subsection, to have committed the primary offence.  
      
       
     36 The appellant’s submission was confined to the proposition that the Crown had to show, in relation to mens rea: 
      
       
        
       (a) that he knew that a shooting had occurred; and that 
        
        
       (b) with that knowledge, he tampered with and assisted in the disposal of the vehicle used in the shooting with the intention of hindering the discovery of evidence concerning  
       that 
        shooting. 
        
         
        
       
     37 As I understand this submission it was not put that the appellant had to know the specific details of the shooting, going for example to the time, place and identity of the victim or victims or, as I have observed, the identity of the shooters. However, he had at least to know that a person or persons had been unlawfully shot, and that the motor vehicle had some association with that event. 
      
       
     38 S 315 takes its part within a framework designed to deal specifically with attacks upon public justice. In the second reading speech concerning the Crimes (Public Justices) Amendment Bill 1990, the Attorney-General observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The amendments contained in this bill will rationalise and reform the law concerning offences involving interference with the course of justice. Offences that damage the administration of justice strike at the very heart of our judicial system. It is fundamentally important that confidence is maintained in our system of justice, and to this end it must be protected from attack. Those who interfere with the course of justice must be subject to severe penalties 
         ” ( 
         New South Wales, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 
          Legislative Assembly, 17 May 1990 at 3691). 
         
        
        
       
     39 Counsel for the appellant invited comparison with the offence of being an accessory after the fact to any serious indictable offence (other than those mentioned in s 348 and s 349 of the Crimes Act) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. In essence, his submission was that since it was essential to criminal liability, as an accessory after the fact, that the accused be shown to have known the facts amounting to the precise offence committed by the principal or primary offender: R v Stone (1981) VR 739 and R v Tevendale (1955) VLR 95, it was unlikely that the legislature had intended to create an offence under s 315 which carried a larger maximum penalty, but which did not require a similar state of mind to that required for accessorial liability. 
      
       
     40 It is true that, in a case such as the present, and perhaps in other cases falling within Part 7, the Crown could have charged the appellant or a person in his position as an accessory after the fact. It does not, however, follow that accessorial liability necessarily equates with liability for public justice offences, for all purposes. 
      
       
     41 In particular, I do not see that it must inevitably follow that the same requirements as to mens rea attach, since the public justice offences have specifically been created to protect the administration of the criminal justice system itself. 
      
       
     42 I have given consideration to the question whether any light is thrown upon the question of principle which arises, by reference to any of the other provisions which are to be found in Part 7, specifically sections 316, 321 to 324, and 333. 
      
       
     43 It is to be noted that s 315 speaks in terms of “a serious indictable offence”. However s 324 provides for an increased maximum penalty in relation to offences under ss 321 to 323 (interference with witnesses, jurors, Judicial Officers, and public justice officials), where those offences respectively are committed with the intention of procuring “the conviction or acquittal of any person of any serious indictable offence.” (Emphasis added). S 333(2) which provides for an increased maximum penalty in relation to offences under s 333 (subornation of perjury), is in similar terms. 
      
       
     44 The foundational offences (ss 321 to 323 and 333(1)) clearly do not require proof of the knowledge of the offence to which the relevant proceedings relate. However it is clear that, in order to attract the circumstance of aggravation, the Crown would need to prove the additional mental element, that is the intention mentioned in s 324 and s 333(2). 
      
       
     45 As Gibbs CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ observed in Kingswell v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 264 at 280: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         There is a close analogy between those cases in which the existence of the circumstances of aggravation converts the offence from a lesser to a greater one and those in which the existence of the circumstances of aggravation renders the accused liable to a penalty greater than that which could have been imposed if the circumstances did not exist. In cases of the first-mentioned kind, the circumstances of aggravation become elements of a distinct offence and therefore must be specifically alleged in the indictment. Where the circumstances of aggravation do no more than increase the maximum penalty, they do not alter the nature of the charge although they do affect, sometimes very materially, the legal consequences that may flow from a conviction. The rule of practice laid down in R v Bright is consistent with the fundamental principle that questions of fact affecting the liability of the accused to punishment should be decided by the jury when the trial is on indictment. The position is different when the circumstances said to aggravate the offence are relevant only to the exercise of the sentencing discretion of the judge. Although it would be an exaggeration to say that that the rule of practice in R v Bright has been generally applied in cases where the circumstances of aggravation increase the maximum punishment but do not change the offence, it is a beneficial rule and ought generally to be followed. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     46 The “rule of practice” in R v Bright  [1916] 2 KB 441 was drawn from the remarks of Darling J who, when delivering the judgment of the Court, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         [the judge] must not attribute to the prisoner that he is guilty of an offence with which he has not been charged – nor must he assume that the prisoner is guilty of some statutory aggravation for the offence which might, and should, have been charged in the indictment if it had been intended that the prisoner was to be dealt with on the footing that he had been guilty of that statutory aggravation. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     47 This view would accord with that discussed in He Kaw Te v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523, Bahri Kural v The Queen (1987) 162 CLR 502 and Regina v CWW (1933) 32 NSWLR 348. It clearly is necessary in the case of an accused charged under ss 321 to 323 or under s 333(1), for the Crown to establish the specific intention referred to in s 324 or in s 333(2), before he or she could become liable to the increased maximum penalty. It is this circumstance which explains the approach which is taken in Part 7 concerning these offences – namely that the circumstance of aggravation relating to intention has become an element of a distinct offence and must be charged. However, there is nothing in these provisions, arising from a comparison of the references to “a serious indictable offence” in s 315, and to “any serious indictable offence in ss 324 and 333(2)”, which throws any further light on the issue which presently arises. 
      
       
     48 Section 316, by comparison with ss 315, 324 and 333(2), it may be noted, creates an offence of concealing a serious indictable person, which arises where: 
      
       
        
       (a) “ 
       a person has committed  
       a 
        serious indictable offence and another person [the accused] who  
       knows or believes 
        that  
       the  
        offence has been committed 
       ” and has information which might be of material assistance; 
        
        
       (b) fails without reasonable excuse to bring that information to the attention of a relevant person.  
        
        
         
         Clearly in that case, the Crown would need to establish knowledge or belief in the accused of the commission of  
         the 
          actual offence. 
         
        
       
     49 The differences in the ways in which these public justice offences have been formulated does not assist in the resolution of the present issue. All that is common to them is the fact that the Crown need not prove that the accused knew that “the offence” which was committed, that being the expression used in s 313, amounted in law to “a serious indictable offence”.  
      
       
     50 In these circumstances I find the question at issue particularly difficult of decision. On the one hand it may be that the legislature did not intend to narrow the ambit of the provision to cases where the accused knew of the precise facts going to establish the specific primary offence which had been committed, and intended to bring within its sphere of application those who acted with reckless indifference as to what the primary offender had done, although with the intention of assisting him or her to escape detection for whatever that might have been.  
      
       
     51 On the other hand, it might be thought unreasonable to impose criminal liability, under s 315, upon a person who, having good cause to believe or suspect some act of criminality had occurred, but not knowing what it was, even in a general sense, then acted in the relevant way provided by the section. 
      
       
     52 At that end two considerations lead me to the conclusion that the appellant’s submission is to be preferred.  
      
       
     53 First, the issue needs to be understood in the light of the traditional rule that criminal statutes, if ambiguous or doubtful, should be construed strictly, that is, in favour of the accused: see for example Beckwith v The Queen (1976) 135 CLR at 576 per Gibbs J, and Murphy v Farmer (1988) 165 CLR 19 at 28-29. 
      
       
     54 This has a relevance for the present case since it was open to the legislature, had it intended to give the wide potential operation to the legislation contended for by the Crown, to achieve that result when enacting s 313, for example by adding the words “or the precise nature of that offence”.  
      
       
     55 Secondly, there is the consideration that absent some general understanding or awareness of the nature of the primary offence, there is something of a logical difficulty in an accused forming an intention to hinder the discovery of evidence concerning it. Had the provision been directed to include cases depending on constructive knowledge of the primary offence, or upon wilful blindness or recklessness in relation to it, then it might have been expected that the legislature would have made that clear. In this regard I am not persuaded either by reference to the amendments, the second reading speech, or the explanatory memorandum, that an application of the purposive rule of statutory interpretation (s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) achieves the result contended for by the Crown. Specifically, it is not clear to me that the purpose, or the mischief to which the amendments were directed, is stated with sufficient clarity to bring about that result. 
      
       
     56 It follows, absent evidence in this case that the appellant was aware in a general way, of the nature of the primary offence, concerning which he was intentionally hindering the discovery of evidence, there should have been a directed verdict.  
      
       
       Ground 2 – Verdict Unreasonable 
        
       
     57 It was submitted that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported on the evidence, having regard to: 
      
       
        
       (a) what was said to be the unreliability of Rossini as a person with an indemnity or undertaking, and with a motive to falsely implicate the appellant in the offences charged; and 
        
       (b) the absence of any evidence to show that the appellant had knowledge that the vehicle had been used in any particular offence. 
       
     58 For the reasons already mentioned it is not necessary to deal with this ground.59 I would propose that the appeal be allowed, the conviction and sentence be quashed, and a verdict of acquittal entered.  
      
       
     60 I would however add that if it had been the unexpressed intention of the legislature to create an offence which would be complete where a person deliberately hindered an investigation, or the discovery of evidence, or the effecting of an arrest, in relation to an offence, which happened to be a serious indictable offence, committed by another person, without specifically knowing or having reasonable cause to suspect what that offence was, then it would be appropriate for consideration now to be given to amendment of this Part of the Crimes Act.  
      
       
        
       
     61 SULLY J: I have read in draft the judgment of Wood CJ at CL. I adopt gratefully his Honour’s canvass of the relevant facts, of the issues now to be resolved, and of the competing submissions made in connection with those issues. 
      
       
        
       As to Ground 1 
        
       
     62 In my opinion the following analysis is correct: 
      
       
        
       1. There is, as Wood CJ at CL points out, a measure of ambiguity about the intended operation of section 315 of the  
       Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) 
       . The nature of that ambiguity is summarised in paragraphs 50 and 51 of his Honour’s judgment. 
        
        
       2. Any attempted resolution of that ambiguity must take account of section 33 of the  
       Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) 
       . That section provides, relevantly: 
        
        
         
         “In the interpretation of a provision of an Act ………………, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act …………….. (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act ………………………..) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.” 
         
        
        
       3. Section 315 forms part of Part 7 of the  
       Crimes Act 
       . The  
       “purpose or object underlying” 
        section 315 cannot be considered properly otherwise than in the context of the  
       “purpose or object underlying” 
        the Part of which the section is but one of a number of legislative components.  
        
        
       4. The  
       “purpose or object underlying” 
        Part 7 is the enactment of a comprehensive statutory scheme in connection with public justice offences. The comprehensiveness of the statutory scheme is underlined by the provisions of Division 5 of Part 7. Those provisions effectively abolish all of the antecedent common law offences against public justice excepting only the three particular common law offences referred to in section 343.  
        
        
       5. Approached in that way, sections 313, 315 and 316 operate together so as to produce the following results: 
        
        
        (a) There is to be a clear policy distinction between unlawful action and unlawful inaction. That distinction is to be made manifest in the scale of relevant punishments. Mere unlawful inaction will attract a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years. Unlawful inaction, if deployed as a bargaining counter in the pursuit of personal advantage, will attract a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. Unlawful action will attract a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years.  
        
        
        (b) Mere unlawful inaction is to be constituted by the withholding, without reasonable excuse, of information in circumstances where:  
        
        
        (i) a crime has been committed; and 
        
        
         
          
           
           (ii) it is in fact a serious indictable offence as defined in section 4 of the  
           Crimes Act 
           , whether or not that fact is known to the holder of the particular information; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (iii) the holder of the particular information either knows or believes that the crime has been committed; that is to say, either knows of, or believes in, the existence of facts that are capable in law of constituting a crime; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (iv) the holder of the particular information either knows or believes that the information might be of material assistance in the lawful detection of the crime or in the lawful prosecution or conviction of the offender. 
           
          
         
        
        
        (c) In such a case of unlawful inaction, the holder of the particular information does not have to know that the relevant crime constitutes a serious indictable offence as defined by section 4 of the  
       Crimes Act 
       : section 313 of the  
       Crimes Act 
        expressly so provides.  
        
        
        (d) Neither, in my opinion, does the holder of the particular information have to know that the facts, whether known or believed to exist, amount in law to a crime of particular definition, e.g. that the facts constitute manslaughter rather than murder. 
        
        
        What the holder of the particular information does have to know is that the facts known or believed to exist either have attracted, or might well attract, the attention of the police or some other relevant authority. It is that knowledge which generates logically an awareness of the potential materiality of the information, with the consequential obligation not unreasonably to withhold the information from the police or other relevant authority. 
        
        
        (e) The next relevant stage in the statutory progression adds to the knowledge discussed in (d) above an active pursuit by the holder of the particular information of some collateral benefit in exchange for the unreasonable withholding from the proper authorities of the information. 
        
        
        (f) The next relevant stage in the statutory scheme moves the focus away from the holder of the particular information and onto any person who does, or threatens to do, anything that is intended to achieve the withholding of the information by frightening the holder of the information into withholding it. The seriousness, as seen by the legislature, in the progress from the holder’s own cupidity to his successful intimidation by another is marked by an increase from 5 to 7 years in the term of the statutory maximum penalty of imprisonment. 
        
        
        (g) Section 315, the next relevant stage in the statutory scheme, moves the focus yet further away from the withholding of information, and onto any unlawful activity that is aimed directly at the hindering of the proper investigation of a serious indictable offence. The statutory maximum penalty, in line with the distinction between unlawful activity and unlawful inactivity, remains at imprisonment for 7 years. 
        
        
        (h) In such a case of unlawful action, the unlawful actor does not have to know that the offence which he is proposing to hinder constitutes a serious indictable offence as defined by section 4 of the  
       Crimes Act 
       : section 313 of the  
       Crimes Act 
        expressly so provides.  
        
        
        (j) Neither, in my opinion, does the particular actor have to know that the facts, the investigation of which he is proposing to hinder, amount in law to a crime of particular definition. 
        
        
        What the particular actor does have to know is that the facts which he knows or believes to exist either have attracted, or might well attract, the attention of the police of some other relevant authority. It is that knowledge which generates logically, first, the intent to hinder that attention on the part of the police or other relevant authority; and secondly, the consequential activity which gives effect to that intent. 
        
        
        (k) In the present case, what the appellant knew, taking the evidence at its highest in favour of the Crown, was: 
        
        
        (i) that something had happened away from the Telopea Road premises; 
        
        
        (ii) that whatever it had been, it was seen by those involved in it as not only likely to attract police attention, but also as likely to attract an immediate and massive police response; 
        
        
        (iii) that those involved perceived a need to deal with the motor vehicle so as to frustrate that police response; and 
        
        
        (iv) that by doing what he did to assist, he was associating himself with that intended frustration of the police response. 
        
        
        (l) In my opinion this was a sufficient state of knowledge and belief to satisfy the requirements of section 315.  
        
       
     63 I would not uphold Ground 1. 
      
       
        
       As to Ground 2 
        
       
     64 The relevant principles are stated definitively by the High Court of Australia in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. The principles are now well established, and there is no present need to detail them. 
      
       
     65 The core of the Crown case against the appellant was the evidence of the witness Rossini. Rossini was, plainly, a problem witness by reason of his own significant criminal antecedents. He was closely and vigorously cross-examined; and it is, in my opinion, fair to say that the cross-examination did disclose variations between things said by Rossini in evidence at the appellant’s trial, and things said by him on previous occasions, and either in statements to the relevant law enforcement authorities, or in evidence in other criminal proceedings. I have found it very difficult to form a confident assessment, sight unseen, of Rossini as a witness. A reading of the transcript of his evidence does not suggest to me that it can be said with the requisite assurance that his evidence is so obviously deficient and lacking in probative force as to entail no other conclusion by this Court than the conclusion that, “even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted ………………………”. : 181 CLR, 494. 
      
       
     66 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. There was some support for parts of his evidence, that support coming from evidence called in his case at trial from members of his own family. The appellant’s case was simple. It was that Rossini was, simply and comprehensively, lying in his allegations about the appellant. It was the appellant’s case that he had not been at the Telopea Street premises at any time on the relevant day. The appellant did not put a case of mistaken identification; and he could hardly have done so, bearing in mind that he and Rossini were well acquainted with each other. 
      
       
     67 The jury was confronted, therefore, with two diametrically opposed versions of the essential relevant facts. It is not suggested that the learned trial Judge misdirected the jury in connection with the way in which the jury should approach the resolution of that conflict. The verdict of the jury is not explicable on any basis other than the basis that the jury accepted, beyond reasonable doubt, the version given by Rossini. 
      
       
     68 In those circumstances, I do not think that a proper application of the principles enunciated in M justifies this Court, which has no sense at all of the atmosphere at the trial, and which has neither seen nor heard either Rossini or the appellant, in now setting aside the verdict of the jury. 
      
       
     69 I would not uphold Ground 2. 
      
       
     70 For the whole of the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
      
       
     71 DOWD J: I have read the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in draft form. I agree with the proposed orders and with his Honour's reasons.

      DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR TRADING v. TIMOTHY AARON O'KEEFE 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings the offender has pleaded guilty to a charge of contempt. That charge of contempt was made for breach of an injunction obtained by the Director-General of the Department of Fair Trading restraining the offender from carrying on certain unlawful financial broking activities. 
     
      
    2 Because of those activities, numerous members of the community had lost very substantial sums or had them put at risk. The total amount of what had been put at risk or lost was quite high. The submissions of the Director and the summary provided from the affidavits filed in support of the application for the injunction disclose numerous members of the community had been so affected, having been lured into providing monies as deposits for further finance which finance was not forth coming and the deposits disappeared. 
     
      
    3 The statement of charge in relation to the charge of contempt referred to the offender's disobedience of the orders made by the court on 27 July 2001, in that, after the offender was on notice of the injunction restraining him from those activities during the period between 7 August 2001 and 12 November 2001 he engaged in the promotion, advertising, marketing and supply of financial services including finance broking; he entered into contracts for the supply of financial services in contravention of that order and engaged in conduct, which it was charged constituted a breach of s.42 of the Fair Trading Act in contravention also of the order. 
     
      
    4 It was further charged that he had by himself and others engaged in conduct constituting a breach of s.53 of that Act in contravention of the order and had engaged in the carrying on of business of a financial broker also in contravention of the order. 
     
      
    5 It was charged that he had breached s.9 of the Credit (Finance) Act 1994 in contravention of paragraph seven of the order of court; he had failed, in contravention of paragraph eight of the order to repay to the Department of Fair Trading on behalf of the consumers, the monies of which they had been deprived which are referred to in the letter, Exhibit B and the schedule referred to in the statement of charge. 
     
      
    6 The offender was apprehended and has been in custody since 18 January. Upon the matter being called on he has pleaded guilty to the charges. At no time has there been raised any opposition to any of the matters of fact referred to in the charge. It is accepted by counsel on behalf of the Department of Fair Trading that the sentence should date from 18 January and that I should have regard to the offender's plea as an early plea and as I am required to do insofar as s.22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is applicable. 
     
      
    7 And further I am to have regard to that matter to which I will come shortly expressed to the probation and parole services officer and referred to in the report of that officer which is Exhibit E, concerning the offender's regret for the actions that have placed him before the court. I note that on the content of his expression of regret at his inability to repay the monies and his attitude to contravening the order the report said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He is just being stubborn and not taking the court's decision seriously.” 
        
       
      
    8 But also that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He hopes he can put this mistake behind him and get on with his future and hopefully go into some kind of business to repay his victims of the Department of Fair Trading.” 
        
       
      
    9 This latter statement is some evidence of some degree of contrition which should be taken into account on sentence, particularly in the case of a sentence for contempt of court, since the offence of contempt of court places particular emphasise on, not only personal deterrence, but also the requirement that an offender be prepared to recognise the authority of the court, so that the processes of justice may not be subverted by some such conduct as an offender has performed or by others who might by reason of some light punishment of such persons be similarly minded. 
     
      
    10 In addition, it is accepted in argument by both counsel for the offender and for the Department that I should have regard to the principles referred to by the High Court of Australia in Cameron v. Queen [2002] HCA 6 which it is accepted for the same reasons as one would have special regard for contrition, should be particularly taken into account on a charge of contempt, that is where, as here, an offender's plea shows a personal willingness to facilitate the processes of justice. 
     
      
    11 I am therefore required to pass a sentence reflecting the objective seriousness of the offender's crime as mitigated be application of the principle enunciated by the High Court in Cameron (supra) since in this case the plea of the offender has, it is accepted by counsel for the Department, operated to facilitate the processes of justice. It is further submitted by Ms. Loukas on the offender's behalf that he should receive also the utilitarian value of the plea in accordance with the principle in  Regina v. Thompson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 which provides for an objective basis for a discount on sentence. It has been held in Regina v. Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142, that the principle in Thompson (supra) continues to have operation in New South Wales over and above the applicability of the subjective factor to which the High Court made reference in Cameron (supra). 
     
      
    12 In this case, given the submissions that have been put on behalf of the department and the circumstances of the offender's confinement since 18 January this year until today, it is not going to be necessary for me to consider just how much weight needs to be placed on the different components that might go in to the synthesis to make up the final product of the sentence. I need not resolve the precise nature and extent of the relevant discount and the relative applicability of Cameron (supra) and Sharma (supra) to a sentence for contempt. Having regard to the course I have decided I should take, it will not be necessary for me to evaluate numerically or by some staged approach, the different considerations appropriate to the sentence. 
     
      
    13 But in coming to the view I have, it must not be considered that the objective circumstances of the offence are under rated. Contempt of court by continuing with activities from which a person has been restrained which deprive members of the community of substantial sums of money, revealed by the evidence to be in the order of $100,000 to $120,000, is very serious criminality and goes to undermine the processes of justice. As has been submitted by counsel for the Department of Fair Trading a substantial gaol sentence is required. 
     
      
    14 I have been provided with a deal of material to show the circumstances and attitude of the offender which caused him to commit the offences. That material includes his prior record which shows minor criminality on his part as a child, although that criminality did reach the serious peak of offences of malicious damage by fire and break, enter and steal for which he received community service orders. He has on his record other offences of stealing and break, enter and steal for which he was fined and one offence of shoplifting for which he received probation. 
     
      
    15 In addition, he has had on 27 October 2000 the offence of break, enter and steal for which he had been placed on a recognizance to be of good behaviour for two years so that at the time of the commission of these offences he was already bound by an order of the court to be of good behaviour. Thus, in his case, the criminality includes a further disregard for the processes of justice. 
     
      
    16 He has not repaid the monies, in other words, has not complied with the court's order. Nonetheless, his explanation of that is one which I am not minded to reject, that is, he does not at present have the monies and that accords with the circumstances the Department has referred to, where in his finance broking activities, other persons appeared to derive substantial benefits from the monies that were obtained. However, I have regard to what on his part I accept is a worthy intent held by him at the moment which perhaps will be persevering that should he be able to carry on profitable business activities he expects to compensate the victims of his earlier schemes for what they have put in. 
     
      
    17 Having said all that, I recognise that I am not sentencing the offender for his participation in those schemes or for embarking on any fraudulent operation or persevering in any fraudulent operation; he is not charged before me with those matters. He has not pleaded before me to those matters, he has pleaded only to the offences that I have set out as charged and he is to be sentenced for contempt of court, not fraud. 
     
      
    18 The circumstances in detail of the activities, the history of the grant of injunction and the breach are to be found set out in Exhibit F and it is not necessary for me for the purposes of this sentence to repeat those matters in the detail there set out. 
     
      
    19 As to his personal circumstances, a reference filed on the offender's behalf by his father emphasised that he had recognised the offender at about the age of 12 as being an out-spoken and independent person who apparently had to grow up early but gets led astray into hot water.  
     
      
    20 Barbara Suitor, a welfare worker has furnished a reference. She has known the offender since mid-1996 when he was 16 years old. She had known him until some time near his 18th birthday. During his relocation back to Taree at the beginning of 2001, she has maintained contact with him. He has spent a large part of 1996 and 1997 in contact with a local youth service; she was his case worker, she knew of his background. 
     
      
    21 It is sufficient to say that she provides evidence of a dysfunctional family in which the offender, from his youth, was the subject of a considerable degree of violence and in his childhood forced to grow up very quickly, as his father said, in the context of domestic violence and a separated family. He developed certain physical conditions and in particular a reaction by way of allergy to certain kinds of food which created behaviour of an aggressive, hallucinatory and, occasionally, psychotic nature. 
     
      
    22 His behaviour from the age of 12 as noted in his criminal record is not surprising in that context, he being subjected to the challenging home environment in which he found himself. He has been able to find and maintain regular employment albeit that he has shifted from time to time from one employment to another. This picture underlies the criminal record to which I have referred. 
     
      
    23 When in Queensland, according to Ms. Suitor, he was the subject of an attack which has operated somewhat understandably upon his mind. His life following that attack, so it was said by Ms. Suitor, commenced to change and the consequence was that he appeared to allow his then stable housing, employment and domestic relationship to break down and he developed less of a regard for the attitudes of others. 
     
      
    24 His mother, in a reference provided for the court says much that goes to confirm the observations of Ms. Suitor. She says this:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""He has always wanted to succeed in life and made sure their children were cared for. He has been trying to provide money, support and ongoing happiness to us all even if it is meant some things are not being fully understood by some. His determination to make sure his family is looked after is something that has caused some problems for my son but I know now he has more than enough time to think about and realise he may have to do things another way.” 
        
       
      
    25 She refers to his obsession with wanting to do the right thing for his family by way of acquisition of wealth for that purpose. 
     
      
    26 Mary Thompson confirms a deal of what is said in the mother's reference. 
     
      
    27 In a report by Anita Duffy of Duffy Barrier Robilliard Psychologists dated 11 April 2002 is set out the offender's unfortunate prior history to which I have already referred. It's not necessary that I set out that in the detail there recorded. 
     
      
    28 There is reference made to the stable domestic relationship to which I have referred, to the two sons born to the offender in that relationship and the separation, at a time which is consistent with following the attack. 
     
      
    29 At that stage the offender apparently returned to Taree. It was there he started, with a partner, the business that resulted in the Department seeking the injunctions. 
     
      
    30 He has had problems not only with the law but also with his mental condition having been admitted to a psychiatric ward when he was 14 at Kempsey. 
     
      
    31 In addition, he has been of recent times and immediately prior to the commission of these offences, depressed to the extent of attempting to take his own life whilst living at his brother's place over the Christmas period prior to the commission of the offences, this apparently in consequence in particular of the break down of his domestic relationship. Not surprisingly his youth has been marked by the excessive consumption of alcohol to the point where he accepts he was drinking to forget about his life. I need not refer in detail either to the history given by the psychologist of the various influences in the domestic environments. 
     
      
    32 The assessment provided by the psychiatrist concludes that he had a history of being involved in domestic, dysfunctional relationships in his family, that he lived the life of a rather homeless and disaffected person. He has wished to impress his family and his mother with his success, he has strongly paranoid features in his personality by way of suspiciousness and defensiveness, which have developed in response to the abuse and emotional neglect he has suffered. The break down of the relationship with his girlfriend and her taking the two children has left him in a state of severe depression and alcoholism and he turned from that, bearing in mind his rigid inflexible modes of thinking, to what seemed to be almost obsessive business activities in order to attempt to display his prowess. 
     
      
    33 At the time he spoke to the psychiatrist he apparently did not believe that he had done anything wrong but as I have said, at the time he spoke to the probation and parole service officer he appears to have recognised that he has. 
     
      
    34 That officer's report which, in terse style, seems to support the reflections of Ms. Duffy includes reference to the break down of the domestic relationship the growing up in a dysfunctional family and the alcoholism and the degree of gambling. The report offers consideration of a number of sentencing alternatives, it confirms the offender has limited resources and would have difficulty paying a fine. That report notes the offender is suitable for a community service order or periodic detention and that he has made the offer that for the purposes of undergoing such sanction he'll be prepared to reside in Sydney with his uncle. I do not regard such sanctions as appropriate in the context of this matter. 
     
      
    35 Notwithstanding that he has admitted he drank and gambled excessively, the writer considers these activities did not contribute to the offence of contempt of court. It is however remarked by the writer that Mr. O'Keefe may benefit from participation in programmes focused on addressing his alcohol and gambling issues. 
     
      
    36 When I have regard to the form of punishment that appears to me the most fitting, I note these remarks in the context that it would be appropriate if, whilst he is on parole, a supervising officer could give attention to the prospect that he should participate in such programmes.  
     
      
    37 It appears to me that the submission made by counsel for the Department that an appropriate sentence would have to have regard to those matters, which in a contempt sentence loom large is made out. It is necessary for the offender to recognise those considerations, that is, that his conduct has been seriously criminal and to express his willingness that it not be further perpetuated and that he is to be punished for breaches of the law which have the tendency to undermine the processes of justice. Those considerations could not have satisfactorily been answered in this case by a sentence of much less than 12 months imprisonment. 
     
      
    38 But it was submitted on behalf of the Department that that sentence of twelve months would have to be discounted having regard to the various factors to which I have referred and that on an appropriate synthesis a sentence of six months imprisonment with an appropriate non-parole period should be imposed. There was no demurrer from Ms. Loukas to that proposal. 
     
      
    39 There is some doubt expressed in some circles that the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 would apply to sentences for contempt. Assuming it does, it would be appropriate to set a non-parole period, and having regard to the circumstances it would not be appropriate to increase the sentence so that a non-parole period would be imposed in extending beyond the term already served. 
     
      
    40 Section 46 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A court may not set a non-parole period or a sentence of imprisonment if the term of the sentence is six months or less.” 
        
       
      
    41 I have regard to the submissions made by counsel concerning the appropriate term of the sentence. I am of the view that to reduce by reason of the discounts the sentence by the 50% that has been suggested would be to exceed what is appropriate in the context of this case. I do consider that an appropriate starting point is a sentence of 12 months. 
     
      
    42 In my view, the appropriate sentence, having regard to the various factors in the synthesis including in particular the objective seriousness of the offence and the particular subjective circumstances of the offender which are set out in the report of Anita Duffy which I regard as special circumstances and which in particular include his psychological makeup, his age, his dysfunctional childhood and his attempts to carry on an business but in a way which it is said is unlawful, and having regard to the fact that I am sentencing for contempt and not for the crime of fraud, a sentence of nine months imprisonment with a non-parole period to expire today, should be imposed. That will leave the offender under supervision for a little over five months. 
     
      
       
      HIS HONOUR: Could you give consideration to the precise form of sentencing order I should make having regard to the Act and let me have a short minute. I'll hand you down the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
       
      
    43 Mr. O'Keefe, I am required to explain to you the sentence I propose to pass. Under it you will be liberated today but you will be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service for the balance of your sentence, which would be a sentence of nine months to date from 18 January 2002. 
     
      
    44 You would be required to obey the reasonable directives of the relevant officer of that service including submitting yourself to such programmes in relation to alcoholism and gambling as that officer might reasonably direct and to be of good behaviour during that time, do you understand that? 
     
      
       
      OFFENDER: Yes. 
       
      
    45 HIS HONOUR: Very shortly I expect to receive from counsel a draft of the appropriate form that sentence should take which will include relevant recommendations and those matters required by the regulations so that it might be a valid sentence both at Common Law and under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, at which time I shall pass sentence formally upon you. Would you, for the moment, please sit down. 
     
      
       
      GRIFFIN: There is also an issue of costs your Honour? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Firstly, there is normally no costs in criminal proceedings but in contempt proceedings particularly contempt proceedings between litigants orders for costs are made. 
       
       
      You are in some respects a private litigant, in some respects the State. He hasn't got the money, he may not have it for a while, your orders for costs will operate one would think in competition with any prospective compensation that he might be able to make. 
       
       
      Nobody, I would have thought in this context wants bankruptcy because then he would avoid the responsibility for compensation. You might consider drafting up such an appropriate order as you seek but I should indicate I am not prepared to make an order for compensation as a condition of parole or anything of that order nor an order for costs as a condition of parole. If you want some orders over and above that then could you let me know once I have passed the formal sentence? 
       
       
      GRIFFIN: Costs were awarded initially. My instructions are to seek a particular order; I understand what your Honour is saying. That has to be dealt with elsewhere, I understand the are considerations I need to satisfy. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I am giving you the opportunity to mention it again shortly. 
       
       
      LOUKAS: In essence we're looking at the Form 3 regulation in relation to alcohol and gambling -- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Good behaviour, supervision, alcohol and gambling. Check on the legality of the sentence I intimated I would pass and write it down so I know what recommendations apply. I have to make specific recommendations and the idea is to prescribe a non-parole period ending today. 
       
       
      LOUKAS: So if he be released today he is to contact the probation and parole service within seven days at Port Macquarie, we will attend to that. 
       
       
      SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
       
       
      LOUKAS: What I would indicate is that both my friend and I have settled on this document together, it follows form three, a copy of the standard conditions must be attached to this order. I didn't have a copy of volume three, with me but it's Regulation 215 to which you should refer -- 
       
      
    46 HIS HONOUR: Would you please rise, Mr. O'Keefe. In respect of the crimes charged against you of contempt of court, I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of nine months to commence on 18 January 2002 and to expire on 17 October 2002. 
     
      
    47 In respect of that period of imprisonment, I impose a non-parole period to commence on 18 January 2002 and to expire today. I direct your release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period of that sentence, that is today, upon the conditions to be set out in the parole order, that there be supervised parole under the conditions prescribed by s.95 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the Regulations under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, a copy of which standard conditions will be attached to the parole order. 
     
      
    48 The order is also to be subject to the following additional conditions that you are, for the duration of your sentence, to be subject to the reasonable directions of the probation and parole service. You must insofar as this condition is not already a condition of your parole you must be of good behaviour and must not, whilst on release on parole, commit any offence. 
     
      
    49 Next, the relevant parole order may be revoked if you contravene any of the terms or conditions of the parole or in the event that the Board determines that it has sufficient reason to believe that you will contravene the parole or have not been adapted into the normal community. 
     
      
    50 It is my intent when sentencing you as I do and prescribing that parole that you should participate in programmes in respect of your alcoholism and gambling should it be considered appropriate by the parole authorities. It is a term of your release that within seven days you report to the office of the Probation and Parole Service in Port Macquarie, first floor, 17 Short Street. 
     
      
    51 Those terms have been taken down by the court reporter and will be supplied shortly in transcript form. It will be necessary once my associate has produced a document setting out those terms, for the file to be produced to the registry to enable the appropriate documentation to be entered into. 
     
      
    52 Mr. O'Keefe, you have to go with the officers. We will ring down to the registry to inform them when the terms are ready so the documentation can be prepared, do you understand that? 
     
      
    53 There being no good reason why costs should not follow the usual event as is the practice in a case like this, I order the offender to pay the plaintiff's costs.

      CHARLES ANTHONY BUGEJA v ANTHONY PERSONACE 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
       
     1 HANDLEY JA: The Court has decided that it should order a new trial in these actions against both defendants and on all issues. I will ask Heydon JA to give the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 HEYDON JA: This is an appeal by the plaintiff against orders made by Gamble ADCJ on 22 August 2001 after a hearing on 24 to 26 July 2001. She ordered a verdict in the plaintiff’s favour of $118,000, of which the first defendant was to pay $39,300 and the second defendant was to pay $78,700. She ordered the first defendant to pay 33 per cent of the plaintiff’s costs and the second defendant to pay 67 per cent of the plaintiff’s costs. 
      
       
     3 This appeal is on quantum only, liability having been admitted at the trial by both defendants. 
      
       
     4 The trial judge had to deal with the effects on the plaintiff of two motor accidents, one on 14 June 1996 and one on 13 May 1998. The first defendant was negligent in relation to the first and the second defendant in relation to the second. She held that the injuries received in the 14 June 1996 accident did not cause “significant impairment within the meaning of s 79A(4)” of the Motor Accidents Act 1988. She said that the first defendant contributed “five per cent of the most extreme case”. She said that the injuries in the 13 May 1998 accident did not cause significant impairment either. She said that the second defendant contributed “10 per cent of the most extreme case”. Accordingly, she made no award for non economic loss for either accident.  
      
       
     5 She appeared to accept what she described as “medical opinion” that the plaintiff’s health would improve and said her award of damages reflected that opinion. 
      
       
     6 It is not necessary to go to the details of the ingredients of the award at which she arrived. In my opinion, there ought to be a new trial and because there is to be a new trial, it is undesirable to say too much about the facts. 
      
       
     7 One of the principal attacks launched by Mr C Hoeben SC, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, against the judgment was that at numerous key places no satisfactory reasons are given. In general it may be said that the reasons for judgment are ill-ordered, very short of reasoning at key points, affected by admitted mathematical error which led to a significant outcome in point of costs from the plaintiff’s point of view and redolent of an unfamiliarity with both the legislation and the field generally. 
      
       
     8 As to unfamiliarity with the legislation, see in particular the passages at the top of page 24 and 27 of the red book, together with the passage at 29.3 of the red book and compare the judgment of this Court in Agostino v Pham [2002] NSWCA 114 at [21] in relation to an appeal from the same judge. 
      
       
     9 Mr Hoeben’s address demonstrated that the trial judge arrived at a number of findings either without evidence, or in the face of evidence. He demonstrated that there was no proper analysis of those factors which must be analysed if an assessment of damages for non economic loss is to be made pursuant to the decision of this Court in Mallah v Keti (1999) 46 NSWLR at 291. 
      
       
     10 So far as economic loss was concerned, the reasoning which appears from page 28.2-.9 was damagingly analysed by Mr Hoeben. The errors which Mr Hoeben has highlighted are in my opinion such as to make it inevitable that the appeal must be allowed. Counsel for the first defendant echoed some of Mr Hoeben’s criticisms, and counsel for neither respondent attempted to refute them.  
      
       
     11 The question then arose as to whether this Court should reassess the damages for itself, or whether the matter should be remitted to the District Court for a new trial. A further question arose as to whether it should be a new trial only against the second defendant but also against the first defendant. 
      
       
     12 In my opinion, it should be a new trial against both defendants, though Mr DJ Russell, who appeared for the first respondent/first defendant, endeavoured to demonstrate that the award of damages against his client, however flawed in the reasoning process which led to it, was nonetheless a not unjust outcome.  
      
       
     13 There is some medical evidence to suggest that the first accident caused significant harm to the plaintiff, in particular an injury was revealed to the plaintiff’s spine, which according to one body of medical opinion though revealed after the second accident could not have been caused by it. 
      
       
     14 As a matter of justice to the second defendant and to the plaintiff, it cannot be said in my opinion that the case of the first defendant is so strong as to preclude its participation in the second trial. 
      
       
     15 Mr Hoeben’s submission in relation to the issue of the second trial was essentially this. He said that this Court could reassess damages by taking into account those parts of the plaintiff’s evidence on which he was not directly challenged, the medical evidence on which there was no cross-examination and other documentary evidence. 
      
       
     16 The difficulty is that in numerous respects the plaintiff’s credibility was challenged, particularly by counsel for the second defendant/second respondent at the trial. It is not clear whether to the mind of the judge those challenges succeeded. It is I think true that there are important areas of the plaintiff’s evidence in chief which were not the subject of challenge, but there was undoubtedly a general challenge to the credibility of the plaintiff. 
      
       
     17 I do not think, without prejudice to the outcome of the second trial, that it can be said that those challenges would be certain to fail at a second trial. 
      
       
     18 Some time was spent in argument as to the impact of a video film made of the plaintiff over some days while at work. The second respondent contended that there were inconsistencies between that film and what doctors reported about their investigations and observations of the plaintiff in consultation with him. The second respondent arranged for the plaintiff to be seen by two doctors after the video was taken but those doctors did not give evidence. However, the fact remains that submissions based on the video were made. 
      
       
     19 In my opinion, issues of credit could have been important at the first trial and it is extremely difficult for this Court to take them into account without having seen the plaintiff personally. That is particularly so in relation to the assessment of non economic loss, because, like the assessment of credibility generally, the assessment of whether a plaintiff’s enjoyment of life has been damaged and to what extent depends on a judgment of the whole human being. 
      
       
     20 In all the circumstances, it seems to me to be unjust for this Court to proceed to assess damages when the issue turns in part on controversial questions resting on the plaintiff’s credibility. That there should be a new trial is a lamentable result, a result which is highly regrettable from the point of view of all parties but in particular no doubt from the point of view of the plaintiff. 
      
       
     21 Accordingly, I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
       (1) That the award of damages made by her Honour in favour of the appellant be set aside. 
        
       (2) The matter be remitted to the District Court for a new trial on damages. 
        
       (3) That the order for costs made by her Honour be set aside and that the costs of the proceedings to date below be in the discretion of the judge hearing the second trial.  
       
     (4) That the respondents pay the appellant’s costs of the appeal. 
      
       
       (5) That each respondent if qualified is to have a certificate under the  
       Suitors Fund Act 
       . 
        
       
     22 HANDLEY JA: I agree. I will only add some very brief reasons of my own.  
      
       
     23 The trial judge assessed the plaintiff’s non economic loss at 5 per cent as a result of the first accident and 10 per cent as a result of the second. Her Honour gave no specific reasons for these assessments. This Court can of course draw inferences or conclusions from the rest of her Honour’s reasons but in my judgment these provide no clear guidance to her Honour’s reasons for these assessments. Her Honour’s assessments could have been based on implicit credit findings, or conclusions drawn from the medical evidence, or could, as Mr Hoeben suggested, be vitiated by errors of law, or could be the result of some combination of all these three matters. 
      
       
     24 When an appellate court concludes that the trial judge has given inadequate reasons, the inevitable result, however regrettable, is that there must be a new trial. 
      
       
     25 Subject to that, I agree entirely with what has fallen from my brother and the orders will be as he announced.

      Judgment 
       
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON, J: I agree with Greg James, J. 
      
       
     2 GREG JAMES, J: The applicant seeks an extension of time to appeal against his conviction on one count in an indictment and leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him on that count and the other count in the District Court of New South Wales held at Campbelltown on 7 September 2001. The applications were lodged on 27 February 2002, almost four months out of time. 
      
       
     3 The reason for the failure to comply with the time limit prescribed by s.10 of the Criminal Appeal Act was given as ""the solicitor received instructions late"". The solicitor had signed the notice of application for extension of time on the applicant's behalf. The reason given is hardly attractive. 
      
       
     4 The applicant had originally pleaded not guilty but on re-arraignment on 23 July 2001 had changed his pleas to guilty. 
      
       
     5 Two grounds of appeal are asserted: that the plea of guilty entered to the first count in the indictment was made in circumstances amounting to a miscarriage of justice and that the sentences were too severe, in particular, having regard to that passed on a co-offender. 
      
       
        
       The sentences 
        
       
     6 The sentences that had been passed on the applicant were in respect of offences comprised in the two counts and one offence of having goods in or on premises reasonably suspected of having been stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained (shortly referred to as the offence of goods in custody) on a Form 1 taken into account. 
      
       
     7 On the first count, the applicant was charged with having supplied a prohibited drug (heroin) on 2 May 2000. That offence is provided for by s.25(1) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985 and is punishable by a maximum penalty of 15 years. There was a similar offence charged on the second count of supply, but an amount of not less than the trafficable quantity of the drug was pleaded. The same maximum penalty, however, applied. That reference to the quantity of the drug indicates reliance by the DPP on s.29 of the Act, the effect of which, in summary, is to deem the accused to have had the drug in possession for supply (and hence to have supplied it) where the accused had that quantity in possession and did not prove the possession was for some other purpose. Both charges were not particularised beyond reference to the date and place of the offence. 
      
       
     8 Having originally pleaded not guilty to both counts, on arraignment before the trial judge, the applicant asked his Honour to take into account the matter on the Form 1 and pleaded guilty to both counts. 
      
       
     9 On count one, the trial judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for a period of three years to commence 28 August 2001, having regard to the applicant's prior custody. His Honour imposed on that count a non-parole period of 15 months to commence on the commencement date of the sentence to expire on 27 November 2002. On count two, and taking into account the matter on the Form 1, the trial judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for three years and three months to commence on 28 November 2002 and directed a non-parole period of one year and nine months to commence that day and to expire on 27 August 2004. 
      
       
     10 The total effective sentence, therefore, was six years and three months imprisonment with a total non-parole period of three years. The co-offender who was dealt with for only one charge was sentenced to three years imprisonment with 15 months non-parole. 
      
       
     11 The first count related to the assistance provided by the applicant to an actual supply on 2 May 2002 of some 111 grams of heroin by the co-offender to an undercover police officer at Canley Vale, the second to the applicant on that day having in his possession for supply more than the trafficable quantity, viz., some 164.9 grams, of heroin at Bonnyrigg. The trafficable quantity is three grams. 
      
       
     12 The goods in custody offence related to the applicant having had some $9,000 in cash on a shelf in his bedroom. 
      
       
        
       The Facts – the first count 
        
       
     13 Shortly, the underlying facts relevant to the first supply charge were that the co-offender was alleged to have been supplying large quantities of heroin in the Fairfield area. As a result, an operation was set up to enable an undercover police officer to purchase heroin from him. 
      
       
     14 On 2 May 2000, that officer met the co-offender in the car park of a hotel at Canley Vale. The officer was wearing a listening device. There was an agreement that the officer would purchase six ounces of heroin for $4,200 per ounce from the co-offender. A small sample was supplied. Later that day, the co-offender and the officer met again in the car park, at which time the officer displayed some $25,000 cash to the co-offender. Shortly thereafter, the applicant and another male arrived and the co-offender spoke to the applicant. Someone from the car shouted ""where's the money"". At the point of exchange of money for drugs then produced by the co-offender, police officers moved in, arrested the applicant, the other male and the co-offender. It was these events and the applicant's admissions which gave rise to the charge on count one. The relevant drugs were those produced to the undercover officer by the co-offender shortly after the arrival of the car. 
      
       
     15 In an interview with police, the applicant told them he was driving around the area when he received a mobile phone call from his co-offender asking him to come to the hotel to pick up money to store at his home. He admitted to police that at least when he was at the hotel he knew that the money would be the proceeds of a drug deal. He asserted, apparently, that it had been agreed between the co-offender and he that he was to receive some financial benefit for receiving and holding the money on behalf of the co-offender. He denied that he had attended the car park for the purpose of delivering the heroin to be sold and denied delivering the heroin to the meeting. 
      
       
        
       The second count 
        
       
     16 After the offender had been arrested, while a search of his premises authorised by warrant was occurring, the police observed him to kick a shoe box behind the bedroom door. That box contained three separate bags containing a total of 164.9 grams of heroin. Also found were a set of Tonga scales, a quantity of empty plastic bags, a roll of brown paper, a hammer, loose plastic tiles, two pairs of scissors, a yellow cutting instrument, nine pieces of foil and two mobile phone cards. I have already referred to the presence of the $9,000 cash which was found. 
      
       
     17 It was the presence of this heroin on his premises with the indicia of dealing in it and the applicant's admissions that gave rise to the second count charged particularly since the circumstances appeared to create an insuperable problem for any attempt to suggest possession for any purpose other than supply whether by the applicant or another. 
      
       
     18 In his interview with police, he told them that he had thought the contents of the shoe box was heroin and said that it was not his but the co-offender had given it to him to mind and had given him some money for doing so. 
      
       
     19 The $9,000 was found next to his bed on a shelf with a Casio calculator and two rolls of adhesive tape. 
      
       
        
       The basis for the pleas of guilty 
        
       
     20 In support of the first count, initially, the Crown had asserted that the applicant had brought the drugs to the meeting. The applicant denied this. The statement of facts eventually tendered to his Honour omitted express reference to the matter. 
      
       
     21 In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge referred to the various circumstances which supported the inference that it was the applicant who had transported the heroin referred to in the first count, the subject of the negotiations with the police officer, to the hotel car park and to the applicant's denial of doing this. However, his Honour concluded that there was little difference in the culpability of the offender if, rather than transporting the heroin to the hotel car park, he was there willing to assist and collect the proceeds of the drug sale. 
      
       
     22 He had earlier noted, when considering whether the applicant should receive the benefit of a plea of guilty having been entered at the earliest reasonable opportunity, that the Crown's earlier assertion that the applicant was the person who brought the drugs to the hotel was, in consequence of the applicant's denial of that matter, withdrawn and the plea entered at a time at which it was first indicated that the facts would be presented in a fashion the applicant did not dispute. Thus it was that the statement of facts came not to contain any assertion of that. The trial judge recognised that was the nature of the plea and that was the basis on which it was entered. 
      
       
     23 Having regard to the principles in Regina v. Thompson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and s.22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, he gave a reduction in sentence to the applicant in the order of 20%, having regard to the pleas of guilty having been entered at the time they were. 
      
       
     24 In referring to the applicant's culpability on the first count, his Honour concluded:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""So far as that count is concerned, he, knowing that a drug deal was taking place, was prepared to render assistance to a person who was to supply the drug to another. He was prepared to do that for reward and in the context where at the same time he was prepared to store a significant quantity of heroin, namely 164 odd grams worth, along with other paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking, in the bedroom of his home. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to each of the separate offences, he demonstrated, in my view, a preparedness to assist those engaged in illicit drug trafficking to a significant extent. 
         
        
        
         
         That assistance is given to and sought by those high up the drug trade hierarchy in order to prevent such individuals being detected and brought to justice. Without the assistance of individuals such as this persons, the drug trade would be less likely to flourish in the way that it does and those whose criminal culpability in relation to the drug trade is greater than this man's, would be more likely to be exposed."" 
         
        
        
        
       Appeal against conviction 
        
       
     25 It is argued that, notwithstanding the applicant was represented by senior and junior counsel who had, on the occasion before the court on 23 July, prior to the applicant's plea being entered, indicated that the applicant would plead guilty and notwithstanding that, when the applicant pleaded guilty to both counts, he was advised by and represented by that Queen's Counsel and junior counsel, the plea of guilty to the first count should be set aside as having been induced by a misapprehension on the applicant's part that the Crown only intended to proceed with the second count and would not be seeking a plea in relation to the first count. The applicant was however arraigned on two counts and did, distinctly plead guilty to those two counts. It is difficult to see how, in the light of what transpired, as is recorded in the transcript of proceedings in the District Court, there was any room for any such misapprehension as was claimed. I will, however, turn, later in this judgment to the applicant's evidence and contentions in this court, that there was a misapprehension. 
      
       
        
       The Transcript  
        
       
     26 The plea was taken on 23 July 2001. The court was informed by senior counsel for the applicant that no interpreter was necessary. On that occasion the transcript records discussion in the presence of the applicant concerning the weight of heroin involved in count one as relevant to the facts that had been tendered to the trial judge concerning that count and the reference to the weight of the drugs relevant to count two. There is reference to discussion concerning both counts carrying a maximum of 15 years imprisonment and discussion with the trial judge concerning the events to which each count related. The transcript records senior counsel for the applicant drawing his Honour's attention to the facts on the applicant's plea as being different to those on the plea for the co-offender and the agreement with the Crown (which matter apparently relates to whether the applicant had brought the drugs to the hotel). It also records senior counsel referring to his clerk going over the facts with the applicant.  
      
       
     27 Bail was successfully sought and the matter was stood over for about a month and a half to 7 September 2001. His Honour directed a pre-sentence report. That report refers to the applicant as disputing a portion of the police facts but there is no suggestion of any such doubt or misapprehension as is now asserted. On 7 September, his Honour received the report, written references and the undisputed summary of his fiancé, Miss Tomas', character evidence from the bar table. After hearing counsels' addresses, his Honour delivered sentence. The applicant was not called. 
      
       
     28 The applicant's ERISP which was before his Honour, clearly shows the applicant has a reasonable command of English and, in particular, in his answers to questions 172-240 where the applicant gives a clear account in English of attending at the hotel for the purpose of picking up what he knew to be the proceeds of a drug transaction and in the answers to questions 365-383, where the applicant clearly disputes any suggestion that he had provided the co-offender with the heroin to supply the undercover police officer. The applicant's command of the English language was entirely appropriate to make his position clear on the matter of specific concern to him. Further, there appears no reason from that interview to apprehend any misunderstanding arising from a language handicap. His evidence in this court and his facility with English before us does not lead me to conclude there was any material language difficulty. 
      
       
        
       Evidence on appeal 
        
       
     29 The complaint seems to be that the applicant did not intend to plead guilty to the first count so far as that count charged an offence of supply by reason of any involvement of his with the bringing of heroin to the hotel. 
      
       
     30 He says that a private investigator had told him that the barristers would speak to the Crown and ask them to withdraw the first charge if he agreed to plead guilty to the second charge on the basis that although he knew the material at his home was the drug, he was minding it for the co-offender. He further says he was told by the enquiry agent, ""it's done, they will drop the first charge. There is going to be no trial."". He says that the agent told him he was to ""plead for knowing the drug was at your house and for the money that was in our premises"". I note that such references are apposite to the second count and the offence on the Form 1 but not to the first count. 
      
       
     31 He affirms that the first and only time he saw the Queen's Counsel was on 23 July 2001 at the District Court. Notwithstanding this, he says that when the court officer read out to him the first charge, he did not know what it was about but since the Queen's Counsel nodded his head to him, he took this to be a motion to him to say ""guilty"". He says he was still confused and when the Queen's Counsel nodded a few more times, he said, ""guilty"", as he trusted the Queens' Counsel. 
      
       
     32 He spoke to the private enquiry agent later asking him what he had pleaded guilty to and was told that he had pleaded guilty to knowing the drug was at his house and for the money that was in his premises. In cross-examination, however, he asserted that the money was his mother's and was not ""drug money"". On such a basis it is hard to see how there could have been any basis for a plea of guilty to that count as involving that money. In his interview with the police he had asserted the money was ""hard working money"" his mother had obtained while working part-time. 
      
       
     33 He says that when he received the two sentences he was shocked and did not know what was going on. He asserts that although he had been in Australia since he was seven, he cannot read and write English, speaks in broken English but did not request an interpreter because he trusted the enquiry agent to explain all the court proceedings to him. He makes no mention of the barrister's clerk going over the facts with him nor of any conversation with either of his barristers. 
      
       
     34 In cross-examination, the applicant contended he was not guilty of the first charge because he had not brought ""the truck"" to the hotel although he accepted that when there he became aware of what was occurring. He denied assisting or being prepared to assist the supply. He contended he was not guilty of the first charge and that his barristers had not told him the prosecution had refused to drop the first charge. In re-examination, he claimed he thought he was pleading guilty to having the $9,000 at his house. He said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""BELLANTO: Q. You said the $9,000 was from your parents? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You knew the judge was taking that into account on your sentence, did you not, as being money form drugs? A. I don't understand. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did Mr. Lloyd explain to you about a Form 1? A. What is Form 1? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did Mr. Lloyd explain to you or discuss with you what would happen to you about the $9,000? A. He said that they take into account of you plead guilty to the second charge. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you pleaded guilty to the first charge, what did you think you were pleading guilty to? A. To having the money at my house. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the second charge? A. For knowing about the drugs. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you mean Aaron's drugs? A. Yes, Aaron's drugs."" 
         
        
        
       
     35 Such an explanation does not square with the trial judge's explanation to the applicant on 23 July 2001 of the matter comprised in the Form 1:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""FOX: Your Honour I also present a Form 1. 
         
        
        
         
         LLOYD: It relates to the $9,000 your Honour, found in my client's bedroom. 
         
        
        
         
         FOX: It's charge of goods in possession reasonably suspected and relates to the $9,000. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Narong Van in sentencing you to the matters you have pleaded guilty to, you ask that I take into account a further matter being in possession – sorry being on premises where there were – sorry goods in premises suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained on 2 May 2000 which relates to the $9,000. Do you acknowledge your guilt in relation to that matter? 
         
        
        
         
         OFFENDER: Yes."" 
         
        
       
     36 Or again on 7 September 2001:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""SINGH: Your Honour, I also have a Form 1 to hand up which has been signed by the offender. 
         
        
        
         
         COLEMAN: Yes, that's correct, your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well he's already signed a Form 1. 
         
        
        
         
         COLEMAN: I thought he did on the last occasion. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: It doesn't refer to the $9,000. It's Canley Heights 2 May 2000 goods in premises were reasonably suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained. He acknowledged his guilt in relation to that and I have a vague recollection that it was indicated that related to the $9,000 cash. 
         
        
        
         
         COLEMAN: Yes, yes, correct your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         SINGH: Your Honour, maybe the Form 1 has been amended because a confiscation application is to be made. That's by consent. 
         
        
        
         
         COLEMAN: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         SINGH: If I could rely on the Form 1 that is handed up today. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well then there is no objection to that being substituted for the old -- 
         
        
        
         
         COLEMAN: Not at all your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Well I will go through the formalities, nonetheless. Narong Van, in sentencing you for the matters which you pleaded guilty on indictment you asked the court to take into account a further offence knowingly that on 2 May 2000 at Canley Heights, goods in premises reasonably suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained, being $9,000 cash in various denominations located in the side drawers within your bedroom. Do you acknowledge your guilt in relation to that matter? 
         
        
        
         
         OFFENDER: Yes, sir."" 
         
        
       
     37 In her affidavit, his fiancée confirms the conversation with the private enquiry agent and the circumstances as related by the applicant of the entry of the plea of guilty. 
      
       
     38 In oral examination in chief, she asserted the private enquiry agent, in the presence of the Queen's Counsel and junior barrister, assured them the applicant would not be sentenced to gaol. She had the view the first count was dropped and the $9,000 was to be given to the Crown. In re-examination she denied being told the first charge would not be dropped and that there would undoubtedly be a gaol sentence. 
      
       
     39 The solicitor for the applicant has sworn an affidavit as to her attempts to contact the enquiry agent and to her lack of success in having him provide material for the appeal. 
      
       
     40 Mr. Lloyd, QC., the applicant's senior counsel, swore an affidavit in which he deposes to his conversations with the applicant in the present of junior counsel. He asserts that he was not privy to nor did he have any knowledge of any conversation that may have taken place between the private investigator and the applicant, although he says that it was likely to have been that person to whom he referred when he used the words ""my clerk"". 
      
       
     41 He swears that on 23 July 2001, he met the applicant in the precincts of Campbelltown Courthouse and confirmed in a detailed conference with the applicant what he had been told were the applicant's verbal instructions to the junior counsel, which were to seek to negotiate a plea of guilty to the second count in full discharge of the indictment but on the basis that, failing this, the applicant would plead guilty to both counts but only on the basis that the brief facts did not assert that he had taken the drugs to the hotel. His affidavit refers to the Crown indicating an intention to proceed on both counts to him but, preparing a statement of facts containing no assertion that the applicant had brought the drugs to the hotel. He says he had formed the view, after speaking to the applicant at some length in the presence of junior counsel, that the applicant did not need an interpreter, even though his command of English was not perfect. 
      
       
     42 With reference to the conference with the applicant, he gives evidence in paragraphs eight, nine, 10, 11 and 12 of his affidavit as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""8. I explained to Mr. Van that the prosecution would not drop the first count on the indictment and that as a consequence he would have to either plead guilty to it or defend the matter at trial. I showed Mr. Van the admissions made by him as reflected in the transcript of his ERISP interview with the police (in particular Q & Q's 165 to 244) and asked him if what he told the police was the truth. He confirmed it was. I advised him that his own admissions and the police observations of him made a strong case against him and that his chances of acquittal were slim. 
         
        
        
         
         9. I recall Mr. Van asking me what sentence he was likely to receive if he pleaded guilty. I told him it would undoubtedly be a custodial sentence and unlikely to be any less than the co-accused who had earlier pleaded guilty but that I would do my best. 
         
        
        
         
         10. I informed Mr. Van that the thrust of the mitigation would be his instructions to me that he was only going to the hotel to obtain from the co-accused (Aaron) the proceeds of the drug transaction and then hold the money on Aaron's behalf, but that he himself did not deliver the drugs to the hotel car park. I informed Mr. Van that I would submit that his position was lesser than that of Aaron and that he should receive concurrent sentences on both counts and a full discount for his guilty pleas. Mr. Van appeared to understand what I had told him and indicated he would plead guilty to both counts. 
         
        
        
         
         11. I told Mr. Van that the two counts on the indictment would be read to him in the courtroom and that he was required to say 'guilty' when this took place. I then returned to the courtroom leaving Mr. Van with Mr. Coleman. 
         
        
        
         
         12. At some stage later on 23 July, Mr. Van's matter was called on and Mr. Van was required to plead to the two counts. It is my clear recollection that he pleaded guilty to both counts. I have read paragraph nine of Mr. Van's affirmation. I have no particular recollection of nodding to Mr. Van. I may well have done so to indicate to Mr. Van that this was the appropriate time to enter his plea."" 
         
        
       
     43 In cross-examination, he admitted the desirability of clear written instructions, he referred to his having gone through the incriminating answers in the record of interview with the applicant and having obtained a clear admission of guilt from his client. His evidence proceeded on the basis that he had advised nothing untoward and that nothing untoward had happened. 
      
       
     44 Mr. Coleman, junior counsel, in his affidavit gave evidence to the same effect, also that when he spoke to the applicant later on the day of arraignment and again on the day of sentence he appeared aware he was being sentenced on two charges and made no suggestion or complaint about pleading wrongly. In cross-examination, he confirmed that he had advised the applicant in detail as to the legal position before the plea of guilty was entered and that it had been entered after a change from the initial pleas of not guilty after he had negotiated successfully for the Crown to drop its contention that the applicant had brought the drugs to the meeting. 
      
       
        
       The submission 
        
       
     45 It is contended that the plea was equivocal or its integrity affected as not being attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt in that the applicant understood the trial was not to proceed if he pleaded guilty to the second count and that in that event the Crown would not proceed with the first count; that he did not believe he was pleading guilty to the first count; that he did not intend to plead guilty to the first count; that he was misled as to the basis upon which he would be required to plead by the private investigator; that he was encouraged to plead guilty in respect of the first count by the action in court of his senior counsel; that his inability to read or write English vitiated the plea; that his speaking broken English had a similar effect and that he did not intent to admit the essential ingredients of the offence charged. Further, it was put, but faintly, that the factual basis for the plea did not support the availability for such a charge in law. 
      
       
     46 It is therefore contended leave should be given to withdraw the plea, as the plea was tainted by ""a mistake or other circumstance effecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt"" (see Regina v. Sagiv (1986) 22 A. Crim. R. 73 at 80). 
      
       
     47 Before turning from the evidence, I note that the trial judge has provided to us a report pursuant to s.11 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In that report his Honour refers to some transcript errors which appear in the transcript of the proceedings on sentence. Notably, that transcript shows the applicant on 23 July 2001 pleading not guilty to the first count. It will be apparent from what I have said that it is plain from the applicant's affidavit and from the submission to this court of his counsel, that it is accepted that in fact the transcript is in error at that point. 
      
       
        
       Legal Basis 
        
       
     48 What is necessary to be shown before an appeal might be successful from a conviction entered up as a consequence of a plea of guilty, has been variously expressed. See Regina v. Boag (1994) 73 A. Crim. R. 35; Regina v. Meissner (1995) 184 CLR 132; Regina v. Maxwell (1995) 184 CLR 501; Regina v. Ross (NSWCCA, unreported 20 February 1994); Regina Liberti (1991) 55 A. Crim. R. 120 and the cases referred to by Spigelman, CJ. in Regina v. Houra  [2001] NSWCCA 61 at paras.32-33. The principles have been conveniently summarised in the applicant's submissions taken from Houra (supra) as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""• Where the appellant 'did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered' ( 
         Regina v. Ferrer-Esis 
          (1991) 55 A. Crim. R. 231 at 233). 
         
        
        
         
         • Where the plea was not 'a free and voluntary confession' ( 
         Regina v. Chiron  
         (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 220 D-E). 
         
        
        
         
         • The 'plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' ( 
         Regina v. Murphy  
         [1965] VR 187 at 191). 
         
        
        
         
         • Where there was 'mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt' ( 
         Regina v. Sagiv 
          (1986) 22 A. Crim. R. 73 at 80). 
         
        
        
         
         • Where the 'plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the appellant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty … some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' ( 
         Regina v. Concotta 
          (NSWCCA, 1 November 1995, unreported)). 
         
        
        
         
         • The 'plea of guilty must either be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt' ( 
         Maxwell v. The Queen 
          (supra) at 511). 
         
        
        
         
         • If 'the person who entered the plea was not in possession of all of the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt' ( 
         Regina v. Davies  
         (NSWCCA, 16 December 1993, unreported)). See also  
         Regina v. Ganderton 
          (NSWCCA, 17 September 1998, unreported) and  
         Regina v. Favero 
          [1999] NSWCCA 320."" 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     49 To the cases cited should be added reference to Regina v. Iral [1999] NSWCCA 368 in which the failure of the appellant to appreciate the nature of the charge and difficulties with an interpreter lead to the appeal being upheld; Regina v. Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97 where the advice of trial counsel to enter the plea was held to be imprudent and inappropriate thus occasioning a miscarriage of justice; Regina v. McLean [2001] NSWCCA 58 in which senior counsel's inappropriate advice on the applicant's ability to challenge a relevant matter of fact occasioned a miscarriage of injustice; Regina v. KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273 involving improper pressure by counsel and Regina v. Becheru (CCA, unreported 6 April 2001) and Regina v. Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 A. Crim. R. 533. 
      
       
     50 In Liberti (supra) at 122, Kirby, P. referred to the court's approach to a proposed change of plea or to an asserted want of understanding of what was involved in a plea of guilty as with ""caution bordering on circumspection"", since such a plea in law is an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence and is the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: see Lee, J. in Sagiv (supra). In Meissner (supra) Brennan, Toohey and McHugh, JJ. at 141 said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""A court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, provided the plea is entered in the exercise of a free choice in the interests of the person entering the plea. There is no miscarriage of justice if the court does act on such a plea, even if the person entering it is not indeed guilty of the offence."" 
         
        
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     51 I am unable to accept the applicant's submission. In my view the evidence of the Queen's Counsel where it is at odds with that of the applicant and his girlfriend is to be preferred since it appears to be directly borne out by the transcript and confirmed by Mr. Coleman. I see nothing in the evidence to admit of any basis on which the applicant could doubt that he was being dealt with for his role in two separate events. Indeed, the very importance to him of his contention that he had not taken the drugs to the hotel, underlined his awareness of the charges. When both charges were read to him, he entered a plea of guilty with no suggestion of any mistake. The participation in the drug supply transaction as an accessory present to assist by taking away the proceeds was an adequate basis for the charge. It was the Form 1 offence that related to the keeping of the $9,000 and that was carefully explained to him. I see no room for the suggestion that the keeping of the drug dealer's money could apply to anything other than count one. 
      
       
     52 I see no reason to doubt the integrity of this plea. 
      
       
     53 I note the Queen's Counsel's evidence that he had advised the applicant that he would do his best to achieve concurrent sentences before the plea was entered. Such advice could not have left the applicant in any doubt but that pleas of guilty to both counts were what was going to occur. In my view this challenge is wholly without merit. 
      
       
     54 I am unable to accept the assertions of the applicant to the contrary. I do not consider that having regard to his earlier disquiet concerning the plea raising an admission that he brought the drugs to the hotel, he did other than enter the plea in the circumstances advised by his senior counsel and accepting that his admission of guilt to that charge would be received upon a different basis to that involved in the assertion that he had himself carried the drugs to the meeting. 
      
       
     55 That is precisely how the matter was dealt with by the learned trial judge. It appears to me that the applicant's present disquiet arises from the fact that he received what might not necessarily have been hoped for by him in consequence of that denial, that is, partly cumulative rather than wholly concurrent sentences on the two counts. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       Appeal against sentence 
        
       
     56 I turn to the second ground of appeal which asserts that the sentence is overly severe in that his Honour wrongly applied the principle of parity since he held that the co-offender would have a justifiable sense of grievance had wholly concurrent sentences been passed. 
      
       
     57 In my view, his Honour would have been in error if that was the sole rationale for the sentence. It is inappropriate, as has been submitted, to have regard to whether a co-offender would have a justifiable sense of grievance if an otherwise appropriate sentence were to be passed. That is not, however, the case here. I turn to consider the severity of the sentence in comparison with that passed on the co-offender. 
      
       
     58 When passing sentence, the trial judge referred to the applicant's prior circumstances, the applicant's conviction and sentence for armed robbery on 4 December 1997, upon which sentence other offences, including aggravated armed robbery, possession of a firearm, possession of a prohibited article and kidnapping were taken into account. 
      
       
     59 His Honour also referred to the bond on which the offender had been placed on 12 April 1999 for two years by the Cobham Childrens' Court. It therefore appeared that the offender had been both in breach of parole and in breach of that bond at the time of the commission of these offences. His Honour noted that supervision on the bond and parole by the Probation and Parole Service were terminated six days before the offences with which his Honour was dealing. Particularly, his Honour had regard to the sentences he had imposed on the co-offender who had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and adhered to that plea in the District Court. 
      
       
     60 His Honour noted the differences in the co-offender's circumstances and the differences in their respective culpability but in particular, the aggravating feature that the applicant's offence was committed whilst on bond and parole. It was appropriate, having regard to the trial judge's view, that the two offenders should receive for the count one offence, equivalent sentences. Similarly, it was appropriate after considering all matters that they should receive similar non-parole periods for that offence. 
      
       
     61 The co-offender, however, had been sentenced for only one matter so that parity between the two offenders in the total sentence was not possible. His Honour concluded that the sentences for the two crimes should be partly cumulative but found special circumstances, in particular arising from that accumulation and the applicant's age and that these sentences would be the first to be spent in an adult custodial institution so that the non-parole period was less in proportion to the total sentence than it might have been. Overall, the sentences and non-parole periods were not excessively severe nor overly disparate from that passed on the co-offender. 
      
       
     62 As to the submission that the sentences should have been completely concurrent, his Honour exercised his discretion to make the sentences partly cumulative and partly concurrent when sentencing for two discrete offences. It was submitted that the storage of drugs in the applicant's bedroom and the assistance in receiving the money in the car park formed part of one continuous course of criminal conduct and as such the sentences should have been concurrent. I do not accept that submission. 
      
       
     63 The trial judge held that they were distinct and separate offences. Had the applicant supplied the co-offender with the relevant heroin, there might have been the relevant connection. But in that regard, the applicant's culpability may well have been assessed as very much greater than the trial judge assessed it to be. 
      
       
     64 This court sits to correct error, if any, in the sentence. Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that it is only in the event that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed, that the court may intervene. The question of the exercise of discretion in making sentences cumulative or concurrent is one which attracts the well known principles in House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. (See Regina v. Pearce (1998) 103 A. Crim. R. 372.) I see no basis here on which I might conclude that there was any error in the sentences or non-parole periods fixed by the trial judge or in his decision to make those sentences partly cumulative and partly concurrent. 
      
       
     65 As it has been necessary to hear full argument, I would propose the court grant the extension of time sought and the leave to appeal against sentence, but dismiss the appeal against both conviction and sentence. 
      
       
     66 KIRBY, J: I agree with Greg James, J. ********

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: In this matter, the applicant was sentenced following entry of a plea of guilty in the District Court of New South Wales at Bathurst to one count of supplying heroin on an ongoing basis contrary to s.25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. She had pleaded guilty to that charge in the Local Court and that plea was accepted on sentence as having been made at the earliest opportunity. 
      
       
     2 On 9 February 2001, his Honour the trial judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of 12 months, to commence on 4 February 2001. 
      
       
     3 Application is made for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against the sentence and for that leave. That application for extension of time is supported by an affidavit, which has been filed in court and which has been read. The Crown does not oppose the grant of that extension of time. 
      
       
     4 Shortly summarising the background to the application, the applicant was dealt with at the same time as her de facto husband, Scott Christopher Boardman, who also pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to three years, nine months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years, 10 months. His sentence was backdated to the date of his arrest, 12 July 1999. 
      
       
     5 He sought leave to appeal against sentence in the Court of Criminal Appeal and this court, differently constituted by Grove and Howie, JJ. granted that leave, allowed the appeal and re-sentenced the applicant (Regina v. Boardman [2001] NSWCCA 431). It noted the argument put to it that there was a degree of disparity between the sentence originally passed upon that applicant and that passed upon this applicant. In so doing, it also noted the particulars of the two sentences and the circumstances to which the trial judge had made reference when the sentences were imposed. It however allowed the appeal upon a ground, which is common to the sentences that were imposed upon both applicants and which ground is put forward by Mr. Dhanji of counsel on behalf of the applicant before us. That is, his Honour erred in sentence by assessing the criminality of the applicants on the basis that there was an intention in the two of them to expand the scope of their criminal operations, their joint enterprise, in the small scale selling of the prohibited drug. 
      
       
     6 His Honour the trial judge had concluded and held expressly that that intent was made out beyond reasonable doubt and, although it was open, so it was held by the Court of Criminal Appeal, for the sentencer to rely upon that matter to rebut any suggestion by the offender or by this applicant, his wife, that the particular incidents which constituted the charge were isolated, or any suggestion that they intended to close down or desist from criminal activity, it was not open to be relied on as it apparently was relied on by the trial judge to assess the total criminality and in particular to afford a basis of imposing a greater sentence than would otherwise have been imposed. 
      
       
     7 The Court of Criminal Appeal in Boardman (supra) did conclude that the error had had the result of increasing the sentences that would otherwise have been appropriate. (See paragraph 15 in the judgment of Grove, J.) 
      
       
     8 So much was said at paragraphs 13 to 19 in the judgment of Grove, J., with whom Howie, J. on that aspect agreed. 
      
       
     9 The submission before us is that the trial judge similarly erred when sentencing the present applicant. 
      
       
     10 The Crown has conceded that error but has submitted that when one has regard to the proved circumstances of the offence nonetheless and having regard particularly to the finding of special circumstances, the sentence notwithstanding that error is “as low as it could go”. 
      
       
     11 Having regard to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, there would appear a considerable degree of at least procedural and some degree of substantive disparity were this court to conclude that that error had not affected the quantum of this sentence. For my part, I would conclude that the trial judge fell into the error submitted so that an adjustment of sentence is necessary and that accordingly the extension should be granted, leave to appeal allowed, the appeal upheld and the applicant re-sentenced. 
      
       
     12 In that regard, it should be noted that the applicant is presently at liberty and it has been conceded by the applicant’s counsel, the applicant having already served the non-parole period as originally passed, that an interference with the non-parole period of the sentence is to some extent academic. Nonetheless, the course that I consider the court should adopt is to reduce both the head sentence and the non-parole period of the sentence to reflect the view of the effect of the error taken by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the decision in Boardman (supra). The sentences passed by the learned trial judge should be quashed and in lieu the applicant sentenced to a head sentence of two years four and a half months, to date from 4 February 2001 and to expire on 17 June 2003, with a non-parole period of some eight and a half months, to expire 17 October 2001. 
      
       
     13 I would propose those orders. 
      
       
     14 CARRUTHERS, AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     15 GREG JAMES, J: The orders will be therefore as I have proposed.

     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence passed upon the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales, in consequence of his plea of guilty to having knowingly taken part in the supply of a prohibited drug, to wit methylamphetamine. That is an offence constituted under s.25(1) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985, for which the maximum penalty prescribed is 15 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     2 The applicant had pleaded not guilty at trial but was found guilty by the verdict of the jury, and convicted of the offence in consequence thereof. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three years, to commence on 6 December 2001 and expiring on 5 December 2004. A non-parole period of two years, expiring on 5 December 2003 was imposed. The applicant had been on bail, prior to the verdict, which had been reached on 6 December 2001. 
      
       
     3 The usual written submissions on behalf of the applicant, required prior to the matter coming before the court, in support of the application for leave to appeal against sentence, have not been filed. Mr. Simpson, of counsel, appearing on the applicant's behalf this morning, informed us of the reasons why that course had not been taken. With commendable skill and frankness, he has, with the court's leave, made oral submissions on the only ground that he said appeared to him to be of substance, that is that the sentence passed was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     4 His approach to this matter, in the circumstances of his having received a late brief, and the matter being in the condition he referred to, was entirely realistic and appropriate. He has contended that the learned trial judge fell into error, in that the sentence imposed manifestly exceeded that which was appropriate, having regard to the crime of which the applicant stood convicted. Such a ground requires some examination of what was proved at trial. 
      
       
     5 Shortly, it was the Crown case as apparently accepted by the jury that the applicant knowingly took part in the supply, on the date in question, of some six ounces, that is, 155 grams roughly, of methylamphetamine, being sold by a man named Brett Butcher to an undercover police officer known as ""Sam"", at the car park at Town Beach at Port Macquarie. 
      
       
     6 The applicant's involvement in that sale was said to have been established in a number of ways particularised by the Crown, that is, providing the amphetamines for sale, providing the premises from which the drugs were uplifted for sale, and standing ready to receive the proceeds of that sale. It was on those bases that his guilt was established before the jury. 
      
       
     7 The trial judge concluded that the jury accepted each of the three ways in which the prisoner's involvement was particularised as being made out beyond reasonable doubt, and that, he himself, was also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the prisoner was engaged in the crime in those ways. 
      
       
     8 The trial judge, in his remarks on sentence, set out in detail the matters relied upon in evidence to support the charge as so particularised, and in particular, that there had been conversations between the applicant and Butcher, referring to a car and tyres, which in the circumstances it was submitted to the jury by the Crown, were coded references to drug transactions. His Honour noted that it was necessary, the jury acting in accordance with his directions at trial, for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the references in those conversations were, in fact, references to drugs. 
      
       
     9 Having regard to the grounds taken, and the argument in support thereof, it is not necessary for me to go into more detail of the background to the verdict of the jury. It is necessary however, to refer to the fact that there were a continuing series of transactions between Butcher and Sam, but there was no indication whatsoever, in the observations, surveillance or telephone intercepts, of any involvement of the prisoner in any of those other transactions, and that on the prisoner's arrest, there was no discovery of any material suggesting any course of involvement in drug dealings, or the indicia of supply or fingerprints on bags of drugs, or any such matter as might indicate that the prisoner was involved in the other transactions. 
      
       
     10 Indeed, there was none of the money, which had been paid by the undercover officer to Butcher, located in the prisoner's home. The proceeds of Butcher's last transaction with the undercover officer, were located still in Butcher's possession. The culpability of the relevant offence is to be assessed having regard to the conduct of the offender on the occasion charged. However it should be noted, the innocent explanation as to the association between the two at the time of the events charged that the applicant propounded at the trial, was obviously rejected. Thus, the offender's conduct must be assessed in the circumstances of Butcher's conduct with Sam. 
      
       
     11 The conversations between the applicant and Butcher, which are set out by his Honour in the remarks on sentence, are plainly indicative of coded references, which in the circumstantial case made by the Crown at the trial, were plainly capable of being accepted as relating to the drugs. 
      
       
     12 The Crown submitted on sentence, and his Honour accepted, that the offender was not simply allowing his premises to be used as a storage facility for drugs belonging to Mr. Butcher, but his role went beyond that, to the extent that he was substantially and intimately involved in the supply of drugs. 
      
       
     13 His Honour further accepted, that the conclusion was inescapable that Butcher turned to the prisoner, not as some willing repository of the drugs, but as a person who was, in a real sense, intimately involved in the transaction, to the point where he appears to have had, at least in practical, or commercial terms, a controlling say. It was not Butcher, for example, who was apparently able to specify a price. 
      
       
     14 It was Butcher who sought his guidance, or approval, as to a larger transaction, where his Honour held the only rational conclusion open, was that it was on the say so of the applicant that such a transaction might be contemplated. 
      
       
     15 The only rational conclusion, according to his Honour, was that the prisoner took part in the transaction, intending to receive the proceeds of providing the drugs, and providing such control over the circumstances, as to require Butcher to contact him in order to carry out such a significantly larger transaction, than those Butcher had formerly carried out. 
      
       
     16 His Honour's conclusion was that as a central finding ""the prisoner was intimately involved in the transaction at a substantial level of culpability"", although his Honour was of the view that the evidence did not allow him to make a more precise finding than that. 
      
       
     17 Totally at odds with that picture, were the subjective circumstances of the prisoner, who was a person who had not been previously involved in substantial criminality (unlike Butcher); who was a family man, and who apparently had a strong commitment to his family, providing a stable environment, and a stable educational upbringing for his children. His Honour noted the offender's acts of kindness and compassion, not only to members of his family but to others in need and his participation in charitable activities and assisting those who have been the subject of domestic violence, particularly in women's resource centres. His Honour accepted the offender had encouraged young people to continue with their TAFE courses, and he had assisted children with recreational and educational activities. His Honour found he was well established businessman in the Port Macquarie area. 
      
       
     18 His Honour noted that these characteristics were at odds with the applicant's involvement in this transaction, particularly since, by reason of those activities, that he would have had a good insight into the problems associated with drugs, and particularly into those associated with drugs and youth. 
      
       
     19 His Honour concluded that it was almost impossible to explain the prisoner's involvement in this offence. He noted there was no financial stress or temptation arising from drug addiction, which might provide some mitigation. 
      
       
     20 His Honour noted that the prisoner, at 48 years of age, would be facing his first gaol sentence, and nonetheless concluded, having regard to the other activities of Butcher, that the applicant should be regarded as a person further up the chain of distribution of drugs, but only in relation to this transaction. 
      
       
     21 His Honour concluded that the appropriate course to take was one reflecting his view, that the prisoner's involvement merited a substantial period of imprisonment, and in those circumstances, he should pass sentence as he did, finding factors amounting to special circumstances which require some re-adjustment of the sentence that his Honour would otherwise have been minded to pass, and mitigating the non-parole period. 
      
       
     22 The submission was made that the sentence exceeded what was proportionate to the culpability of the crime, having regard to the fact that there was no evidence the prisoner had participated in the other activities of Butcher. 
      
       
     23 It is trite law that this court will not interfere with a finding of fact, or a failing to find a fact by a trial judge, where the course taken by the trial judge, was open on the evidence. See Regina v. Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505, in particular at paragraph 41. 
      
       
     24 The ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive, is a ground which will only be made out in the circumstances set out in that decision, and in accordance with the principles expressed by the High Court in House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 where the sentence as passed, can be seen to be entirely out of accord with the circumstances under which the prisoner comes forward for sentence. 
      
       
     25 In House (supra) at 504-505, in the judgment of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan, JJ. appears the oft quoted passage concerning such a ground at 505:- 
      
       
        
         
         “It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred"". 
         
        
       
     26 In the latter circumstance an error of the kind referred to in the former circumstance, but unexpressed, is detected. It is only however, where the conclusion is unreasonable, or unjust, having regard to facts found, that this court may interfere, and indeed, such a conclusion is itself reinforced by the very terms of s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, which only empowers the court to intervene if some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
      
       
     27 Having regard to the sentence passed here, and the facts as found by the learned primary judge, I see no basis upon which it might be concluded that the sentence was, in the relevant sense, unreasonable or unjust. 
      
       
     28 Further, I see no basis upon which it could be concluded that the trial judge erred in his regard to the circumstances of this single offence by the applicant, in failing to find that the offence was isolated, as it was submitted he should have found. What his Honour did was to assess the criminality of the offence charged, while expressly disclaiming that that criminality should be aggravated in any way by any involvement, or any perceived involvement of the applicant in the other offences of Butcher. Such an approach was not only, in my view, not in error, it was patently correct. His Honour did not have to find the offence was isolated or aberrant. 
      
       
     29 I am of the view therefore, that the application for leave to appeal the matter, having been argued to this extent before us, should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     30 CARRUTHERS, AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     31 GREG JAMES, J: The orders will be as I have proposed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
        
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed upon the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales at Moree in respect of an offence of break, enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation. That offence is provided for by s.112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, and for that offence is provided a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     2 On his plea of guilty the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three years and four months commencing on 22 November 2001, the date upon which sentence was imposed, and expiring on 21 March 2005. A non-parole period of 18 months expiring on 21 May 2003 was imposed.  
      
       
     3 The applicant had been arrested on 24 July 2001. He was refused bail for this offence. He remained continuously in custody between arrest and sentence and at the time of his arrest, as was noted by the trial judge, he was on bail waiting to be dealt with on a similar charge in the Children's Court. At the time of the sentence he had not been dealt with on that charge. 
      
       
     4 Subsequently he came before a magistrate in the Children’s Court on that charge, that being 7 March 2002. On that occasion, in circumstances to which I will refer later, the learned magistrate feeling constrained by the nature of the sentence passed in the District Court, and the limited options available to him dismissed the charge with a caution under the relevant legislation. 
      
       
     5 At the time the Magistrate noted the papers “serving three years as an adult”.  
      
       
     6 The applicant came forward for sentence, he having been born on 27 April 1983, aged 18 years. The offence occurred on 21 July 2001. It had been committed in combination with a co-offender, Graham Edward Smith. That co-offender had been born on 14 November 1979. He came forward for sentence aged 22 years. Both offenders had very substantial prior criminal records. 
      
       
     7 The facts giving rise to the charge were set out in a statement of facts which is part of an exhibit tendered before the learned sentencing judge. They are set out in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. I will not repeat those facts in detail. However, by way of short summary it is sufficient to note that at about 6.30 am on the morning of the day in question the two offenders, affected by liquor or some other substance, went to a dwelling house in Moree, kicked the front door in, forced the door and went into the lounge room where they confronted the occupants of the house. At that time each of them was holding a piece of wood with protruding nails. They brandished these pieces of timber. They were aggressive and abusive towards the occupants of the house. They threatened to strike the occupants. They did not in fact strike them, nor did they make any effort to strike them. They demanded bongs. They demanded money. A wallet was taken by one of the offenders and $50 was taken. The rooms of the premises were searched but apparently nothing was taken. 
      
       
     8 Their abuse and aggression continued throughout what was undoubtedly a very frightening episode. When the police were called and attended the premises the offenders attempted to say nothing was wrong and that they were there at the invitation of the frightened occupants of the house.  
      
       
     9 In due course the police left to attend to another matter and the occupants of the house, dissatisfied with the lack of police attention to the matter, went to the police station and disclosed to the authorities what had occurred. Subsequently the offenders were arrested. 
      
       
     10 The trial judge found that the offences were committed under the influence of alcohol and some other illicit substance, having regard to the fact that each of the offenders asserted they had been drinking and smoking cannabis from 9.00 am the previous day.  
      
       
     11 As to the co-offender, the trial judge noted his extensive record and the reference in the pre sentence report to his serious problems with alcohol, cannabis and amphetamine use in respect of which he had sought no assistance. He had taken whilst in gaol, apparently for the first time, steps to seek to come to grips with that problem. 
      
       
     12 He is a person of whom, it could be said, having regard to what was said in the Probation and Parole report, that although he expressed a desire to address the drug problem, he appeared to be a person of whom the Service considered that further involvement by the Service would be unproductive. It was questionable, so the trial judge found, referring to an earlier report, that he could sustain an interest in further eduction long enough to fulfil his potential. The trial judge noted the potential within the accused and the pity his lack of utilising that potential engendered. He had a dysfunctional background and had led an aimless life, leaving school at an early age. 
      
       
     13 The co-offender was on bail at the time of the commission of the offence and he was subsequently sentenced to prison terms totalling five months.  
      
       
     14 The trial judge accepted in the case of the co-offender that the plea of guilty was a genuine indication of remorse and contrition for his criminal conduct on this occasion and this entitled the offender to a discount. 
      
       
     15 He then turned to consider the circumstances of the present applicant. He noted that the applicant was younger, and indeed much younger than his co-offender. He referred to his domestic circumstances, his dysfunctional family, and the abuse he and his mother had suffered in the family relationship. That abuse had caused him to leave home and suffer a disrupted early life. An interrupted schooling had barely left him able to read and write, and although he had a substantial prior record and involvement in alcohol, he had not infringed the rules whilst he had lived with his grandmother, who had been a disciplinarian. His Honour noted he had apparently thrived under the regime but eventually could not stomach it and returned to Moree where he again commenced to get into trouble. 
      
       
     16 Before the court there was material from the Roy Thorn Rehabilitation Centre and the Orana Rehabilitation Centre, which had assessed the applicant as suitable to attend programs run by those services. The drug unit of the Tamworth Correctional Centre had made a number of observations about the applicant, to which his Honour referred. In particular, reference was made to observations on many of the matters to which I have referred, such as the applicant being a weekly binge drinker, who drinks to inebriation. His Honour referred to an episode in the report in which the counsellor said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Although Alfred has paid lip service to wanting to address his substance abuse, it is the writer’s opinion that he has not felt the full consequences of his offending behaviour, therefore, minimising his motivation to change at this stage”. 
         
        
       
     17 His Honour continued in the quote from that report he included in his reasons for sentence to refer to some prospects of rehabilitation, notwithstanding the alcoholism, and to the counsellor’s view that the domestic circumstances of the applicant’s de facto wife were such as might assist in rehabilitation, although it was noted that the applicant was a “strong candidate for relapse” and “he is already fairly institutionalised”.  
      
       
     18 His Honour said that he accepted the plea entered at the first practical opportunity as and a sign of full remorse and contrition. There is no reason to apprehend his Honour did not in that regard sufficiently take those matters into account and apply an appropriate discount. 
      
       
     19 His Honour noted this applicant too was on bail waiting to be dealt with “on a similar type charge in the Children’s Court”. I have referred to this matter already. 
      
       
     20 His Honour turned to a consideration of the objective facts and submissions of counsel and concluded:- 
      
       
        
         
         “To my mind the criminality displayed by each offender in committing this offence is so identical that I cannot and I am unable to differentiate between either accused, even bearing in mind that the offender Duncan is some years younger than Smith, but I do not feel in the light of their prior criminal history, and the fact that both of them were on bail at the time this offence was committed, that I can or should distinguish between the sentence I propose to subject each of them to.” 
         
        
       
     21 His Honour referred to the sentence the co-offender had been serving at the time of sentence for this offence, and the fact that this applicant was awaiting the proceedings in the Children’s Court in respect of the matter on which he was on bail. He concluded rightly, one can only agree, that it was a most serious invasion of a home in which three persons were subject to a period of terror, even of short duration. He concluded that from a specific and general deterrent point of view it had to be brought home to these offenders and others that such conduct in such circumstances would be severely dealt with. He concluded, having regard to the matters for which the discount was appropriate, to the applicant's remorse and rehabilitation as well his having come from a disadvantaged background (referring, I apprehend, to what the Chief Justice said in Regina v. Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28), that nonetheless in both cases a full-time sentence was required to reflect the community’s abhorrence of this type of behaviour. His Honour concluded the appropriate sentence was a full time custodial sentence of three years and four months with a non-parole period in each case of 18 months. 
      
       
     22 His Honour passed sentence accordingly on the co-offender, but having regard to the sentence he was serving and which would expire on 13 January next, his Honour passed sentence in such a way that the sentences would run in part concurrently. 
      
       
     23 In respect of the present applicant, whilst noting that sentence would ordinarily date from the date on which the offender entered into custody, his Honour concluded he would not do that in this case, taking into account that “Duncan on the other hand is not subject to any gaol sentence but was on bail awaiting to be dealt with on a similar type offence in the Children’s Court at the time of his arrest.” 
      
       
     24 His Honour decided that the sentence should date from the day of sentencing in anticipation that the Children’s Court, if it returned a finding of guilt in relation to the matters presently outstanding, or if those matters were proceeded with, would take into account the fact that he had dated the sentence from its passing. His Honour noted he did not know what would happen in the Children’s Court but thought in all the circumstances of the case he should subject both offenders to the same sentence and to the same conditions. His Honour noted both offenders appeared to him to be street wise and there appeared to be no reason for distinguishing between them. 
      
       
     25 He made various recommendations that might assist the rehabilitation of the offenders whilst on parole. 
      
       
     26 It was the first occasion on which the applicant had been sentenced to full time adult custody. 
      
       
     27 When the matter came before the learned magistrate the District Court sentence was noted and it was submitted, both on behalf of the prosecution and by the applicant’s counsel, that from a practical point of view there was nothing much the learned Children’s Court Magistrate could then do and it was in recognition of those matters that the magistrate disposed of the matter in the way I have already referred to. Thus the applicant did not receive the benefit of concurrence his co-offender did. 
      
       
     28 The submissions that have been made on this application contend for four errors in what the learned trial judge did, the first being that the learned sentencing judge erred in mis-applying principles as to parity by determining not to distinguish between the offenders, notwithstanding the difference in their ages. The second, that the learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to give adequate weight to the applicant’s extreme youth. I will deal with those two grounds together.  
      
       
     29 It is apparent that the learned sentencing judge entirely understood the distinction between the two in terms of age but further understood there was no basis to distinguish between them as to criminality or as to prior record. Insofar as his determining that the sentence should date from the date it was passed in each case, he did in the upshot confer a benefit upon the co-offender which was not shared by this applicant. But otherwise I see no basis of error in what the trial judge did in failing to distinguish between them. True it was the applicant was some three months off the age in which he would have been by law a juvenile, but nonetheless he was an adult and his criminality was the same as that of the co-offender, an adult. 
      
       
     30 There is no basis for distinguishing between them on the basis that one was the instigator or one was a follower, as has been conceded on this appeal. Although the applicant was youthful, his youth had been marked by his extensive criminal record and the circumstances that the trial judge referred to, he did not seem to show any substantial signs of change. In my view it is not possible to say that the trial judge erred so as to warrant any interference with the sentence on either of the two grounds so far referred to.  
      
       
     31 Two further grounds are taken, that the learned sentencing judge erred in failing to back date the sentence to the date the applicant was arrested and entered custody; and the resultant sentence predicated upon errors outlined in the other matters that had been put forward, and taking into account the plea of guilty, is manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     32 The commission of offences whilst on bail is regarded by the courts most seriously and it has been stated that sentences for offences so committed will frequently be longer than they would otherwise be, absent such an aggravating factor, particularly where there is a lengthy criminal record showing a contempt for the law, or a lack of indication of rehabilitation. In such cases, the sentence is likely to be greater than it will be for those who commit such an offence for the first time, ie., without such a criminal record, or such circumstance of aggravation. But even given those matters, it would appear to me there is no reasonable basis for his Honour refusing to follow the long standing practice in this court of dating the sentence from the time at which the applicant first entered into custody and thus allowing for the period in pre-existing custody solely referable to the offence. 
      
       
     33 It appears as if his Honour sentenced on the supposition that something would be done in the Children’s Court by way of sanction for the conduct for which the applicant was before that court which would be in addition to the sentence, which his Honour had passed. Because of the timing of events such a thing did not occur but, in any event, as I have earlier pointed out, his Honour intended to deal with them alike, although he recognised he was giving some form of leniency to the co-offender by the two sentences running partly concurrently. I apprehend it was only because he expected that some countervailing effect would be caused by the sentence of the Children's Court and did not intend compensating some advantage to this applicant to preserve parity. 
      
       
     34 In those circumstances, although I would reject the ground that the sentence is in the circumstances manifestly excessive, I accept the submission that the learned trial judge erred in failing to back date the sentence to the date he was taken into custody. Otherwise, in my view the sentence should not be disturbed. 
      
       
     35 In those circumstances I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal, quash the sentence imposed below and in lieu thereof substitute a sentence of imprisonment for three years and four months commencing on 24 July 2001 to expire on 23 November 2004, and a non parole period to date from 24 July 2001 and to expire on 23 January 2003.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 KIRBY J: Lee Ghisolfi (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Keleman DCJ on 15 August 2001. 
      
       
        
       The Charges 
        
       
     2 Mr Ghisolfi pleaded guilty to two charges of armed robbery with an offensive weapon (s97(1) Crimes Act 1900), the weapon being a knife. He asked his Honour to take account of two further charges of armed robbery with an offensive weapon, the weapon in each case again being a knife (Form 1). The maximum penalty under the section is 20 years imprisonment. Mr Ghisolfi was sentenced, on count 1, to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7-1/2 years, to commence on the date of his arrest, 26 January 2001. On the second count, taking account of the offences on Form 1, Mr Ghisolfi was sentenced to a concurrent term of imprisonment of 12 years, with a non-parole period of 9 years. 
      
       
     3 The offences followed a pattern. Each involved a small business run by a woman. Mr Ghisolfi presented with a large knife. He demanded and was given money. 
      
       
     4 The offences took place at a time that Mr Ghisolfi was on parole, having been released on 27 December 2000. The parole was for 2-1/2 years. It was to expire on 27 June 2003. The first offence (part of the Form 1) occurred on 19 January, that is within three weeks of Mr Ghisolfi's release. The second (also on the Form 1) took place the next day, 20 January 2001. The offence in count 1 was committed less than a week later, the 25 January 2001. The offence in count 2, occurred the day after, 26 January 2001. A matter of hours after the fourth robbery, Mr Ghisolfi was arrested. He was returned to custody, where he has remained. 
      
       
     5 Turning to the circumstances of each offence, the offence charged in count 1 took place, as mentioned, on 25 January 2001. Mr Ghisolfi entered a hairdressing salon. There were four women in the salon, the owner and three customers. He produced a large knife which had been concealed inside his trousers. He demanded money. The women scattered, leaving the salon by the rear door. One of the customers left a handbag behind. Mr Ghisolfi took the handbag and left the salon. The bag contained a mobile phone and cash ($140), as well as credit cards. 
      
       
     6 Mr Ghisolfi is said to have distinctive features. He was identified to the police by the customer who owned the handbag, she having been shown a selection of photographs. 
      
       
     7 The second offence occurred the next day, 26 January 2001. It replicated many of the features of the earlier offence. The target on this occasion was a kiosk at the St George Hospital. Mr Ghisolfi waited until the customers had left the kiosk, and the female shop assistant was alone. He then entered the kiosk and produced a knife. He demanded the contents of the cash register. The money was placed in a plastic bag which he was carrying. He escaped with approximately $700. The shop assistant was shown a selection of photographs by the police. She identified Mr Ghisolfi. 
      
       
     8 The offences on the Form 1 again employed the same modus operandi. On 19 January 2001, the applicant entered a hairdressing salon. There were two women in the salon, a customer and the owner. Mr Ghisolfi produced a knife. He demanded money. He was given $300 and then left. Again, he was identified by the salon owner from a selection of photographs. He also left a fingerprint on the front door of the salon. 
      
       
     9 The second offence on the Form 1 took place the next day. Mr Ghisolfi entered a hairdressing salon. There were two women inside. He demanded money, brandishing a knife. Again, he was identified from photographs by the salon owner. 
      
       
     10 Within hours of leaving the salon Mr Ghisolfi was recognised by police as matching the description provided by those who had been robbed. He was interviewed. He denied the offences. He was returned to custody. Ultimately, he pleaded guilty once certain rulings had been made on the admissibility of evidence. 
      
       
        
       The Issue on Appeal 
        
       
     11 The issue on appeal can be stated simply. Counsel for Mr Ghisolfi acknowledged that his Honour's remarks on sentence were a comprehensive and careful analysis of the relevant issues. His Honour correctly identified the principles which should guide him. The views he reached on various issues were views which were open to him. The only indicia of error, therefore, according to the applicant, was the length of the sentence. In written submissions, counsel for the applicant said this: 
      
       
        
         
         ""15. The sentence was a severe one. It was too severe. Twelve (12)years for four (4) armed robberies was out of proportion to the objective seriousness of the offences even taking into account as his Honour did all the aggravating features."" 
         
        
       
     12 There was an element of preventative detention, which was impermissible.  
      
       
     13 The Crown contended otherwise. It said this: 
      
       
        
         
         ""9. ... There is no doubt that the sentences imposed on the applicant were severe. But severe penalties were called for in this case. It must not be overlooked, in assessing the sentences imposed on the applicant, that the maximum penalty for  
         one 
          armed robbery is 20 years imprisonment. Section 97(1) Crimes Act 1900."" (emphasis in original) 
         
        
        
       Past History 
        
       
     14 To understand the sentencing task which confronted his Honour, it is necessary to state in some detail Mr Ghisolfi's criminal past. He was born on 10 October 1961. He was almost forty when he faced these charges. He arrived in Australia from Italy at the age of nine. He first came before the Children's Court at the age of 13. He appeared thereafter from time to time. In 1980 and 1981 he was charged with a number of offences, including assault female and malicious injury. On some of the offences he was fined. On the charge of malicious injury, he was placed upon a recognizance for a period of 12 months. 
      
       
     15 On 1 October 1981, as Mr Ghisolfi was about to turn twenty, he came before the District Court. He was sentenced for six armed robberies to a term of imprisonment of 12 years. A non-parole period was fixed, which was effectively 3 years (expiring on 24 April 1984). It was the commencement of a period of incarceration which was to continue, with only short interruptions, to this day.  
      
       
     16 Soon after his release, Mr Ghisolfi offended again. On 21 September 1984, he was sentenced by the District Court for malicious wounding and break, enter and steal. The sentence was 2 years imprisonment. On this occasion a non-parole period was not specified. The sentencing Judge recommended that he not be released before 1 January 1986. 
      
       
     17 In June 1988, Mr Ghisolfi was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was placed on a 3 year recognizance. In the same month, he was sentenced by the District Court for malicious wounding. The sentence on this occasion was 4 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years. 
      
       
     18 Soon after his release on parole, Mr Ghisolfi again faced multiple charges. In August 1990, he was sentenced in the Local Court to 12 months imprisonment on three counts of stealing, three counts of making a false instrument, three counts of using a false instrument, as well as break and enter. At the same time he was sentenced to a further term of 2 years imprisonment for an offence of break, enter and steal. The non-parole period specified in respect of that offence was 12 months. That sentence was to be cumulative upon the first sentence of 12 months. 
      
       
     19 In April 1992, Mr Ghisolfi was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment for goods in custody. On 31 January 1994, he pleaded guilty before her Honour, Judge Karpin, to five counts of armed robbery, one count of robbery with wounding, and one of attempted robbery. He asked her Honour to take into account a further seventeen matters of a similar kind. The pattern in respect of each robbery was broadly the same. It was the same pattern that can be seen in the offences which are now under review, although involving a different weapon. Judge Karpin described that pattern in these words: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The Crown submits, and I am of the view, correctly, that this prisoner happened upon an efficient means of robbery. Armed with a syringe he entered a number of what appeared to be small shops in which, in all but one case, as far as I can tell from the facts, women were the victims. He presented the syringe, and on two occasions he also was armed with a knife. But his modus operandi was to enter the shop premises, produce the syringe, and made a demand for money."" 
         
        
       
     20 These offences took place at the end of the parole which Mr Ghisolfi was then serving. Her Honour imposed a sentence which effectively was 10 years with a minimum term of 7-1/2 years, and an additional term of 2-1/2 years. Mr Ghisolfi was, as mentioned, released to parole on 27 December 2001. As set out above, he offended again within three weeks of his release. Within the month he was back in gaol. 
      
       
        
       His Honour's Remarks on Sentence 
        
       
     21 His Honour recognised that the offences were most serious, and the more so because they occurred so soon after release on parole for offences of the same type. Plainly deterrence, both general and personal, was important. His Honour included in his remarks the following passage from Veen [No 2] v The Queen (1987-88) 164 CLR 465, as providing appropriate guidance as to the significance of the truly appalling criminal history of the applicant. The High Court in that case said this: (at 477) 
      
       
        
         
         ""... the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences:  
         Director of Public Prosecutions v Ottewell 
          (1970) AC 642, at p 650. The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind."" 
         
        
        
       The Subjective Case of Mr Ghisolfi 
        
       
     22 Judge Keleman was assisted by a comprehensive report by Ms Anna Robilliard, psychologist, who examined Mr Ghisolfi. It identified a number of issues which his Honour dealt with in the course of his remarks. Mr Ghisolfi had been addicted to heroin from time to time. He told Ms Robilliard, as he told Judge Karpin almost a decade earlier, that he managed to remain drug free whilst in gaol, but quickly returned to drugs upon release. Ms Robilliard expressed the view that Mr Ghisolfi was in need of rehabilitation. However, the urge to change the hopeless pattern of his life had to come from within himself.  
      
       
     23 Mr Ghisolfi is a diabetic. He was diagnosed approximately three years ago. He requires a number of insulin injections each day. Again, his Honour dealt with these issues in his careful remarks.  
      
       
     24 As recently stated by this Court in R v AEM Snr & Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58, para 63, sentencing does not involve a process of mathematical formulae, nor admit a single correct answer. The sentencing Judge is given a discretion. In the course of argument, the Court has been taken to statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission, and to other cases in which offenders have been sentenced for armed robberies. Some of these cases involve offences which appear to be more serious, either because of the weapon used, or because of the professionalism which is said to be absent from the offences committed by Mr Ghisolfi. This material is helpful. However, I am not persuaded that there is error. Whilst the sentence imposed upon Mr Ghisolfi is at the upper end of the range, it is, in my view, within the range. 
      
       
        
       Order 
        
       
     25 I would therefore propose the following order: 
      
       
        
       1. That leave to appeal should be granted. 
        
        
       2. But that the appeal should be dismissed. 
        
       
     26 SMART AJ: The facts and circumstances are set out in the judgment of Kirby J. The appellant's point is that with the particular offences of armed robbery involved in the present case, the sentences imposed are excessive and that sentences of the order imposed are reserved for grave cases of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. 
      
       
     27 The armed robbery, the subject of count 2, was a serious offence. The applicant waited until the customers had left the St George Hospital kiosk and then confronted the one female shop assistant on her own with a knife, demanded money, and took about $700. He threatened to come back if she reported the incident. She would have been terrified. On this count, two further armed robberies with an offensive weapon were taken into account. Each involved the applicant entering a hairdressing salon where the female owner and one customer were present, the applicant producing a knife and demanding and obtaining money. The ladies would have been terrified. 
      
       
     28 Taking into account the two further armed robberies, the correct sentence on this count, in my opinion, was one of ten years with a non-parole period of 7 and a half years. 
      
       
     29 As to the first count, the applicant entered a hairdressing salon and confronted the female owner and three female customers. He produced a large knife and walked around the salon. The ladies fled from the shop via a rear door. The applicant took the handbag of one of the customers which had been left in the salon. It contained a mobile phone, a purse, two bank keycards and $410 in cash. All offences were committed whilst the applicant was on parole and within less than one month after release on similar offences. He had over two years to serve on parole. In my opinion, the correct sentence was one of eight years with a non-parole period of six years. 
      
       
     30 I have not overlooked that the maximum penalty is 20 years. I would make the sentences partially concurrent and partially cumulative, as this is necessary to reflect adequately the criminality involved in the offences. An overall result of twelve years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years is correct. Inter alia, this gives effect to the principles of totality. 
      
       
     31 In these circumstances I will withdraw my reasons. I agree with the orders proposed by Kirby J. 
      
       
     32 KIRBY J: The order of the Court will be as proposed by me.

     Criminal law – aggravated sexual assault – Crimes Act 1900 s 61J – aggravation consisting in commission of offences in company – meaning of “in company” – whether trial judge erred in interpretation of phrase – whether misdirection of jury resultedSection 61J Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) relevantly provided: 
      
       
       “(1) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 
        
       (2) In this section, circumstances of aggravation means circumstances in which: … 
        
         
         (c) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons …” 
         
        
       
     The complainant alleged that she was sexually assaulted by five men in a remote area after accepting an offer of motor transport in the early hours of 1 January 1999. Relevantly, the Crown charged G with aggravated sexual assault within the meaning of s 61J(2)(c) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The relevant assault occurred at a distance of fifty metres from other members of the group. The jury found G guilty both of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault. G appealed, arguing that the assault was not aggravated because it was not committed “in company”, and that the trial judge therefore erred in failing to direct the jury not to find G guilty on the count of aggravated sexual assault.Held (Kirby J, Heydon JA and Greg James J agreeing), dismissing the appeal:1. The physical presence of another was required for an alleged crime to be committed “in company” within the meaning of s 61I(2)(c): [121].2. The correct test for physical presence is whether there is such proximity between co-defendants to enable the inference that the coercive effect of the group operated, either to embolden or reassure the offender in committing the crime, or to intimidate the victim into submission: [125].

      Judgment 
      
      
       
        
       
     1 HEYDON JA: Shannon Michael Button appeals against his convictions on 14 December 2000 after a trial by a jury presided over by Viney DCJ, QC, on two charges of having sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting, and in circumstances of aggravation, on 1 January 1999 near Kempsey. Each charge was of an offence against s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900. William James Griffen appeals against his convictions on the same day on two charges to the same effect. Each appeals against conviction only. Button was sentenced on each charge to seven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. Griffen was sentenced on each charge to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years.  
      
       
        
       Background 
        
       
     2 The trial was a joint trial of five co-accused on a total of eleven counts. The general circumstances were described thus by the trial judge in his remarks on sentence.  
      
       
        
         
         “On the evening of 31 December 1998 the complainant …was at Crescent Heads celebrating New Year’s Eve. After the celebrations, in the early hours of New Year’s Day, 1 January 1999, she sought a lift back to Kempsey with Robert Jarrett, who was driving a black Ford Falcon car, which was occupied by the other accused. She knew Jarrett and some of the other young men. The car left Crescent Head and Jarrett stopped it at a secluded location a few kilometres west, where Marr had sexual intercourse with the complainant on the back seat of the car while Jarrett held her arms above her head. Marr was found guilty of this offence as principal in the first degree. That was count one in the indictment. Jarrett was found guilty as a principal in the second degree, count two. 
         
        
        
         
         After Marr finished, the accused Button then thrust his penis into the mouth of the complainant while she was still being held by Jarrett. Button was found guilty, count three, and Jarrett found guilty as principal in the second degree, count four. 
         
        
        
         
         The party moved off and after one or two further stops, which are recounted in the evidence and the summing-up, they eventually arrived at a remote area known as [Dondingalong]. There Jarrett put the complainant on the boot of the car and licked her on the vagina, count five, and also inserted his fingers into her vagina, count six. Ricky Mark Dungah also put his fingers into her vagina, count seven, while she was on the boot of the car. Then Jarrett took her into bushland nearby where he got the complainant to suck his penis, count eight. After Jarrett ejaculated Button emerged from the creek and had sexual intercourse with the [complainant], count nine. When Button finished the accused Griffen took the complainant to a location some 50 metres away and had her suck his penis, count ten, and then had vaginal intercourse with her, count eleven. 
         
        
        
         
         Subsequently the whole party returned to Kempsey about 7.45 am, where the complainant disembarked from the car and then went to the police station and complained that she had been raped by a number of men.  
         
        
        
         
         It is clear that the jury accepted beyond reasonable doubt the version given by the complainant so far as the essential elements of the charges are concerned, and I must say there were abundant reasons for doing so. 
         
        
        
         
         She was a young person, I think 19 at the time. She complained virtually immediately and to the police. She nominated four men, although there was some confusion about the identity of what I think she said was a fellow from South Kempsey. Despite that the woman was clearly distressed and injured, as the medical evidence showed. She was not gravely injured in a physical sense, but it is obvious from the jury’s verdicts that this young, slightly built, woman was totally at the mercy of a group of young men through several terrifying hours of sexual abuse. 
         
        
        
         
         I am conscious, of course, that apart from Jarrett at the quarry none of these prisoners is charged as a principal in the second degree with the offences that his co-accused committed. So in determining the sentence each man has to serve I am not ascribing to him any accessorial liability in regard to offences committed by his co-accused. In this trial each man has only been charged with and convicted of, the offence which he personally perpetrated, saving, of course, the part Jarrett played in holding [the complainant] down in the back of the car at the quarry while Marr and then Button committed their offences upon her at that location. 
         
        
        
         
         Objectively this is a most serious example of individuals taking advantage of the vulnerability of a young woman early in the morning in remote locations and individually venting their lustful designs upon her. Clearly the jury thought so. 
         
        
        
         
         Subjectively, I take into account that just about all of these young men were affected by alcohol. While that is not excuse it might indicate a departure from the usual restraints of human conduct.  
         
        
        
         
         Another feature is that it was not a group of men setting out to find some female prey for their lustful desires. They were all coming back from celebrating the New Year’s Eve at Hat Head, or some such place, and just happened upon [the complainant], who was looking for a lift home to Kempsey from Crescent Head. Thus, subjectively, the circumstances are not those of a sober mean spirited group of predators desirous of despoiling a female at whatever cost. Having said that though the conduct of all of these young men was despicable. [The complainant] is a slightly built person and clearly no match for any of them. They individually had their way with her in what can only be described as a callous abuse of a fellow citizen. The detail of the evidence of her experiences is sufficiently set out in the transcript and I need not repeat it.” 
         
        
        
       Button: Ground 1 
        
       
     3 Ground 1 in Button’s Notice of Appeal was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned trial judge erred in his directions as to the manner in which the jury should consider the issue of lies told by the Appellant [to] investigating police officers.” 
         
        
       
     4 Button’s submissions were: 
      
       
        
         
         “The prosecution case against the appellant included evidence of lies told to investigating police. When interviewed by police on 4 January 2000 the appellant denied having intercourse with the victim. His case at trial was he had consensual intercourse with her.  
         
        
        
         
         He explained this lie by reference to his being ‘bashed badly’ the day before this interview [T 537]. This apparently was motivated by a belief on the part of his attackers that he had committed a rape. He also explained the lie by reference to his co-accused having been charged already and his wanting to avoid getting similarly charged [T 540]. The judge [at summing up 26-27] gave the jury a direction about the use to be made of the lie in the following terms: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           There is another direction I must give to you, members of the jury and it concerns the matter of lies. The Crown argued to you in his address that some of the accused had told lies in their interviews with the police. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Well you will make up your own minds whether the accused, and I speak of them individually, you will make up your own minds whether the accused was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case. You will bear in mind, that according to the evidence there was a lot of alcohol consumed on this night and some of the accused smoked marijuana as well. … Button was interviewed on 4 January, after he had been bashed by some other people he said, on the 2nd. You will take all of that into account in regard to each accused. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           But I must give you this warning, do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that, just because a person has told a lie about something, that is evidence of his guilt. There may be any one of a number of reasons for telling lies. For example, out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid some other consequence. If you accept the explanation given for the lie, for example Mr Griffen’s explanation, you cannot use it as an admission of guilt of these offences by the accused.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that this direction is confusing and erroneous. It does not conform with the directions suggested in  
         R v Edwards 
          (1993) 178 CLR 193. (See also  
         R v Zoneff 
          (2000) 112 A Crim R 114). 
         
        
        
         
         It suffers from the following defects: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) It fails to make it clear to the jury that the onus of proof lay on the Crown to show that the reason for the lie was a realisation by the appellant of his guilt of the offence. It was incumbent on the Crown to exclude alternative reasonable explanations, such as panic or some extraneous fear. [See  
         R v Heyde 
          (1990) 20 NSWLR 234 at 244). 
         
        
        
         
         (b) As a corollary of the above the direction, it is submitted, inverts the onus of proof and made it incumbent upon the accused to provide an explanation which the jury accepted. If he failed to do so the jury could use the lies as an ‘admission’.” 
         
        
        
       
     5 The Crown submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The appellant lied to the police when he was interviewed and denied that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant. There was no issue at trial that what he told the police were lies. There was no dispute at the trial that those lies were deliberately told. There was no dispute at the trial that the lies were about a material issue, namely whether the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         The appellant, at the time of telling the lies to police was, on his account, motivated by two (2) factors: 
         
        
        
         
         i. firstly, as he had been earlier bashed by attackers who believed he had raped the complainant, and, 
         
        
        
         
         ii. secondly, because he was aware that a ‘co-accused’ had already been charged with offences arising out of the events of 1st January 1999 with Miss Chatfield, and he wanted to avoid being charged as well.  
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that the essential elements of lies required by the principle in  
         Regina v Edwards 
          were all met by the evidence in the trial and conceded by the appellant. Those elements included that the appellant feared of telling the truth as he might be charged and was so motivated to lie.  
         
        
        
         
         In the circumstances there was no need for the trial judge to take the jury through the laborious process of going through the check-list of elements of lies with the jury. 
         
        
        
         
         The jury had to be made aware that before they could use lies as evidence of guilt they had to be satisfied that the appellant lied because he was guilty of the offence. It is submitted that the trial judge’s directions as to lies made it clear that this was so. Summing up pp 1.7, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 3.8, 3.9, 4.1 and more importantly at 27.1. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that the alternate explanations for the telling of lies by the appellant were excluded by his explanation of the reasons for telling those lies, see paragraph 3 above. It was not necessary for the Crown to exclude other hypotheses in those circumstances, nor was it necessary for the trial judge to direct the jury to consider such hypotheses. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that all the jury had to consider was whether, when telling those lies for the reasons he gave in evidence it was because of his realisation of guilt of the offences. The directions did not mislead the jury in that task, rather, by telling the jury that if they accepted the explanation given the lies could not be relied upon by the jury, it was to the appellant’s advantage.” 
         
        
        
       First complaint: non-conformity with Edwards v R 
        
       
     6 In Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 210-211 Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “A lie can constitute an admission against interest only if it is concerned with some circumstance or event connected with the offence (i.e. it relates to a material issue) and if it was told by the accused in circumstances in which the explanation for the lie is that he knew that the truth would implicate him in the offence. Thus, in any case where a lie is relied upon to prove guilt, the lie should be precisely identified, as should the circumstances and events that are said to indicate that it constitutes an admission against interest. And the jury should be instructed that they may take the lie into account only if they are satisfied, having regard to those circumstances and events, that it reveals a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it and that it was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in [the commission of] the offence, or, as was said in  
         Reg v Lucas (Ruth) 
          [1981] QB 720 at 724], because of ‘a realization of guilt and a fear of the truth’. 
         
        
        
         
         Moreover, the jury should be instructed that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realization of guilt. A lie may be told out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid a consequence extraneous to the offence. The jury should be told that, if they accept that a reason of that kind is the explanation for the lie, they cannot regard it as an admission. It should be recognized that there is a risk that, if the jury are invited to consider a lie told by an accused, they will reason that he lied simply because he is guilty unless they are appropriately instructed with respect to these matters. And in many cases where there appears to be a departure from the truth it may not be possible to say that a deliberate lie has been told. The accused may be confused. He may not recollect something which, upon his memory being jolted in cross-examination, he subsequently does recollect.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     7 The words “the commission of” have been inserted in square brackets because in Zoneff v R (2000) 200 CLR 234 at [16] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said that these words should be included for the sake of clarity. 
      
       
     8 Edwards v R appears to lay down six requirements. First, the alleged lie should be precisely identified. Secondly, the circumstances and events said to indicate that it constitutes an admission against interest should be identified. Thirdly, the jury should be told that they may take the alleged lie into account only if they are satisfied, having regard to those circumstances and events, that it reveals a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it. Fourthly, the jury should be told that they should take the alleged lie into account only if they are satisfied that it was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matters about which he lied would implicate him in the commission of the offence. Fifthly, the jury should be told that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from a realisation of guilt, and that if such a reason is the explanation for the lie, it is not an admission. Sixthly, the lie must be deliberate.  
      
       
     9 The written arguments assumed that Edwards v R applied in New South Wales without any modification by the Evidence Act 1995. Though in the course of debate about the oral argument advanced on behalf of Griffen in relation to Ground 6 of his Notice of Appeal, which overlapped with Ground 1 of Button’s Notice of Appeal, there was discussion about the effect of the Evidence Act, there was no suggestion that the position of either appellant would be improved by recourse to any argument based on the Act, and its possible impact can thus be left out of account in deciding these appeals.  
      
       
     10 Before considering the terms of the summing up, it is useful to examine the background to it. The evidence concluded on 11 December 2000. The Crown addressed for most of the afternoon of that day. Crown counsel referred to lies by Button, Griffen and Jarrett, and said that the trial judge would direct the jury as to how they could use those lies. At the end of the address by Crown counsel, counsel for Marr criticised the terms of the Crown’s address in relation to lies. Counsel for Griffen asked for an indication to counsel as to what the trial judge proposed to say about lies. Counsel for Button (who is not the counsel who appeared for him in this appeal) asked the Crown to particularise the lies which the Crown wanted the trial judge to give a direction on. Crown counsel said he would do so. Thus the attention of counsel for four of the accused, and in particular counsel for Button, was closely focused on the significance of lies and the directions about them. On the following day, 12 December 2000, the Crown provided the list for which it had been asked and handed it up. The trial judge then responded to counsel for Griffen’s invitation to indicate what he proposed to say by delivering what was described as a “judgment”. After setting out the events just described, the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Before counsel resume any arguments or further discussion on this matter, I want to record these observations having looked at the decision in  
         Zoneff 
         . First of all, it seems to me that this is only marginally a ‘lies case’ such as to invoke the  
         Edwards 
          direction. The issues in this trial in regard to each accused are; one, lack of consent and two, knowledge of lack of consent. Each accused was interviewed by the police. As already indicated in these remarks, there are instances where an accused has denied an allegation of sexual conduct but later admitted sexual conduct claiming consent or belief in consent. This is a frequent scenario in sex trials. 
         
        
        
         
         In those circumstances it is quite proper for the Crown to point to those responses and characterise them if he sees fit as lies told by the accused. That, in my view, is a legitimate avenue of advocacy. Indeed, in this case, as in many contested sexual assault trials, the complainant is cross-examined minutely about variations in her testimony and effectively alleged to have lied and defence counsel pursued these lines with the jury. 
         
        
        
         
         Since the Crown has addressed first in trials in New South Wales, he has to anticipate and meet prophetically the likely submissions of their opponents. In this case, the Crown has anticipated that the defence will argue respectively and perhaps consecutively what they see as a consistent thread of attitude by the various accuseds: that the complainant was a willing and enthusiastic participant in sexual conduct with them. 
         
        
        
         
         Thus, he is entitled and indeed obliged to point to perceived flaws in the individual cases of the accused, including inconsistent answers or changes of stories and characterise them as lies. The Crown is not permitted to put to the jury that they will accept the complainant’s evidence as to the truth to the extent that any denial by the accused is a lie which demonstrates his consciousness of guilt. That concept has long since been laid to rest and is finally buried in  
         Zoneff 
         .  
         
        
        
         
         I do not think the learned Crown Prosecutor has done that in this case. He has pointed to contradictory versions said by Griffen in his record of interview where he firstly denied any knowledge of anything, and then after a short break told a vastly different story. He referred to Button who denied in his record of interview any sexual connection but then gave evidence that he did have sexual intercourse but with consent. Then in cross-examination admitted putting his penis in the complainant’s mouth earlier. Jarrett, in a convoluted discussion with police, in his record of interview denied touching the girl and later said he did so with her consent and so on. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown, in my view, is entitled to point to those matters. True, he once used the phrase ‘consciousness of guilt’ in regard to Griffen and that is frowned upon by the High Court. But this was an address that started at 2.15 and concluded at 3.50. Because there were five accused and a number of areas he had to cover, the Crown chose to divide his submissions into segments dealing with the contents of the 11 counts in the indictment, the specific evidence applying to each accused, the evidence available against all accused and the peripheral evidence from the witnesses Mr Cook, Mrs Cook, Mrs Stanley, Mr Blunden, the elements of alcohol and drugs involved and so on. In the context of such a necessary detailed submission, the matter of lies was but a portion. 
         
        
        
         
         It is against that background that I have considered the comments of counsel and that is why I am delivering these remarks before I hear any further arguments on the matter. It seems to me at this stage that this question of lies told by the accused can best be met with a direction to the jury along the lines indicated by the majority in  
         Zoneff 
         .” 
         
        
       
     11 The direction which the trial judge indicated he would give was in substance what he told the jury, though he added at the end the words: 
      
       
        
         
         “There may be any one of a number of reasons for telling lies. For example, out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid some other consequence. If you accept the explanation given for the lie, for example Mr Griffen’s explanation, you cannot use it as an admission of guilt of these offences by the accused.” 
         
        
       
     12 Following that indication by the trial judge, various counsel made submissions about lies and about other matters. On lies, the contribution of counsel for Button was made after counsel for Jarrett said (transcript 586 lines 21-29): 
      
       
        
         
         “The other thing I wanted to raise was the particularization of the matters led by the Crown which amount to lies as far as Jarrett is concerned. In his address according to my note, in particular 205 to 206 which is he never touched her and 260 which is a question about kissing, motive but to others. The schedule that has been handed up deals with 234, 235, 249, 261, 263, 294. It makes it very difficult for me to address those when he in fact addressed different questions.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge responded (transcript 586 lines 30-40): 
        
        
         
         “That’s why I tended to suggest the direction I had in mind would be more effective. I thought if you start particularising particular questions in the circumstances of this case, you are highlighting the particular question more than once. The Crown has been asked to provide these matters and has done so and I have pre-empted that by what I said this morning. If people are happy with the sort of direction I have in mind then I will not make reference to it.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel for Jarrett said: “I certainly am”. Counsel for Button said (transcript 586 lines 42-47): 
        
        
         
         “Yes, I am generally happy with that direction. As I commented yesterday my position was a bit different from the others because of the nature of the accused Button’s evidence. Of course, I am a bit concerned but my friend might touch on consciousness of guilt, I understand.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge then said (transcript 586 lines 49-50): 
        
        
         
         “Perhaps you can have a chat with him or something.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel for Button then turned to other subjects.  
        
       
     13 In short, the direction now complained of is precisely the direction which counsel for Button said he was “generally happy” with, save that the written submissions additionally complain about the last three sentences. They were sentences which had been foreshadowed by reason of an application by counsel for Griffen, as will shortly be seen.  
      
       
     14 At the end of the summing up on 13 December 2000, the trial judge invited submissions on any further directions which counsel desired. After counsel for Marr put various submissions about matters other than lies, counsel for Dungah said he had nothing. Counsel for Button said: “I’ve nothing your Honour”. Counsel for Jarrett put various submissions about matters other than lies, as did counsel for Griffen.  
      
       
     15 It follows that Button requires the leave of the court under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to advance this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     16 Further, the last three sentences of the summing up on lies were added after counsel for Griffen had asked that this be done immediately after the “judgment” of 12 December 2000: transcript 581 lines 31-36. Counsel for Button voiced no opposition to that course.  
      
       
     17 The first issue is whether the lie was precisely identified. The trial judge referred to the Crown argument that some of the accused told lies in their interviews with the police. After referring to a lie by Griffen, the trial judge then said: “Mr Button denied having sex with the complainant, but gave evidence here that it did occur at [Dondingalong], but she was consenting.” By that the trial judge meant that Button denied vaginal intercourse to the police, but admitted vaginal intercourse in his address to the jury. Button, the only accused to give evidence, at the start of his examination in chief denied the charge that he put his penis in the complainant’s mouth, but admitted consensual vaginal intercourse at Dondingalong (transcript 519 line 49-520 line 11). Button also admitted in evidence in chief that he had denied vaginal intercourse to the police on 4 January 1999 (transcript 537 lines 7-16). That was correct: record of interview questions 330-332, 411 and 435-449. The change of tack by Button would have come as no surprise to the jury, since this position had been foreshadowed in his counsel’s opening address, at the start of the trial. In chief Button assented to the proposition that what he told the police about vaginal intercourse was a lie (transcript 539 lines 12-16). He repeated that language in two of his answers in chief (transcript 540 lines 8-17). Button had also denied oral intercourse in his record of interview (questions 260-261), but after maintaining that denial in chief and for some of his cross-examination, he admitted oral intercourse at the quarry, consistently with the complainant’s evidence, later in his cross-examination (transcript 557 lines 50-54, 558 lines 6-21 and 35-52 and 559 lines 9-24).  
      
       
     18 Button’s evidence was given on 11 December 2000. He was the last witness. Addresses took place on 11 and 12 December, and the summing up took place on 13 December. The lie which Button had told about penile intercourse, which was the only one identified in the summing up, would have been clearly in the minds of the jury in view of the references to it in the opening of Button’s counsel, the evidence in chief, the cross-examination, and the Crown’s closing address, as well as the summing up. Considerable attention was devoted to Button’s explanations for the lie both in evidence in chief and in cross-examination. In short, the lie was precisely identified.  
      
       
     19 The second requirement of Edwards v R is that there be identification of the circumstances and events said to indicate that the lie constitutes an admission against interest. It must have been very plain to the jury that a deliberately untruthful attempt by Button to distance himself from any misconduct on the night in question in the course of his record of interview, despite his admitted presence at the scene of the alleged crimes, went to a material issue in circumstances where he knew that to tell the truth about having had penile intercourse – the actus reus of one of the crimes charged against him – would implicate him in the offence.  
      
       
     20 The third and fourth requirements can be taken together. The third requirement is that the jury be told that the lie should only be taken into account if it reveals a knowledge of the offence. The fourth requirement is that the jury be told that the lie should only be taken into account if satisfied that it was told because the accused knew that the truth about which he lied would implicate him in the commission of the offence. The jury was not told either of these things in terms, but it would have been obvious that the truth about which Button lied was that he had committed the actus reus of one of the crimes charged, and hence to that very considerable extent knew of the offence and was implicated in it.  
      
       
     21 The fifth requirement is that the jury be told that there may be reasons for the telling of the lie apart from a realisation of guilt, and that if there was such a reason, the lie was not an admission. The trial judge did tell the jury this, though counsel for Button at the trial did not see, or at least did not call attention to, any flaw in the original direction proposed by the trial judge, which did not contain that statement. The trial judge did not deal in terms with Button’s particular explanations for having lied (the earlier bashing and the fear of being charged). But Edwards v R does not itself require this, Button does not complain about it, and anyway the explanations had been examined in detail both in examination in chief and cross-examination only two days earlier.  
      
       
     22 The sixth requirement is that the lie must be deliberate. The trial judge told the jury they had to make up their own mind about that.  
      
       
     23 In short, all six of the requirements of Edwards v R were either met in terms in the trial judge’s summing up, or were so obviously met that it was not necessary to do so. Indeed, for the trial judge to have gone line by line through the relevant passage of Edwards v R in circumstances where it was so obvious that some of the requirements had been satisfied might well have been confusing to the jury rather than helpful, and inimical to Button’s interests. Hence the first of Button’s complaints about the direction should be rejected.  
      
       
     24 There is another answer to Button’s complaint that Edwards v R was not complied with. Let it be assumed that there was an absence of full compliance. The genesis of the trial judge’s lies direction was the concern of defence counsel at what the Crown said on that subject. This Court does not know what the Crown said on that subject, but the draft direction in the “judgment” of 12 December 2000 was intended to meet those concerns. Counsel, by their non-protest, or, in the specific case of counsel for Button, by his express concurrence, accepted that the draft direction met the defence concerns. In those circumstances, subject to any just criticism of the last three sentences of the actual direction, it was not necessary for the trial judge to do more than he did. He was unspecific as to how the lies could be used against the accused, though he was specific about how they could not be used. He said the mere fact of a lie was not evidence of guilt. He also said that if there was an explanation for the lie it could not be used as an admission. In drawing attention to the role of alcohol and marijuana on 1 January 1999 and in relation to Jarrett’s interview that day, and in drawing attention to Button’s bashing, the judge was neutralising the possible adverse significance of the lies. Had the lies been crucial to the case, a more detailed direction might have been called for. As it was, the only function of the direction was to negate some difficulty with the Crown submissions. The lies were relied on by the Crown in an unclear way; they were marginal in the light of the conflict between the detail of the complainant’s evidence on the one hand and, on the other hand, Button’s evidence and ERISP; the trial judge did not suggest that they could be used in any decisive or explicit way against the accused. In all the circumstances, even if the summing up did not comply with Edwards v R, the non-compliance did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
        
       Second and third complaints: onus of proof 
        
       
     25 The second and third complaints, which are related, contend that the direction did not make it clear that the onus of proof lay on the Crown to show that the reason for the lie was a realisation by Button of his guilt, and suggested that the onus lay on Button to provide an explanation acceptable to the jury. The bulk of the oral argument on the appeal was directed to these complaints.  
      
       
     26 It is implicit in Edwards v R, and it has been held by this Court (R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234 at 244), that the Crown bears the onus of establishing that the lie proceeds from a realisation of guilt. It is true that the trial judge did not, in that part of his summing up which dealt with lies, specifically direct the jury that the Crown had to prove that the lie proceeded from a realisation of guilt. But most of the first four pages of the summing up were devoted to an explanation of the onus and standard of proof. The trial judge did not there suggest that there was any exception to what he said in relation to any issue in the case. The question is thus whether the last three sentences of the summing up on lies, read in that context, are capable of suggesting a reversal of the onus at that point. In my opinion they cannot be read as suggesting a reversal of the onus. Were they to be capable of being so understood, that fact would have been likely to have attracted a protest from counsel for Button either after he heard counsel for Griffen’s request for the addition of the last three sentences, or after the summing up. There was no protest at either point. It is, in fact, instructive to compare what the majority said in Edwards v R, what counsel for Griffen said in asking for the addition to the direction on 12 December 2000, and what the trial judge said. In Edwards v R the majority said: 
      
       
        
         
         “the jury should be instructed that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realisation of guilt. A lie may be told out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid a consequence extraneous to the offence. The jury should be told that, if they accept that a reason of that kind is the explanation for the lie, they cannot regard it as an admission.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel for Griffen said that he wanted a direction of the kind appearing: 
        
        
         
         “in  
         Edwards 
          along the lines of there may be reasons for the telling of the lie, that is out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person, or to avoid some other unrelated consequence, and if the jury accepts the explanation given for the lie they cannot accept it as an admission made by the accused.” 
         
        
       
     27 The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There may be any one of a number of reasons for telling lies. For example, out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid some other consequence. If you accept the explanation given for the lie, for example Mr Griffen’s explanation, you cannot use it as an admission of guilt of these offences by the accused.” 
         
        
       
     28 In these circumstances it does not appear valid to contend that the trial judge erred in giving a direction in the same language as that used by the majority in Edwards v R and that used by counsel for Griffen in requesting the direction, particularly where counsel for Button had an opportunity to protest about or improve upon the direction requested but did not take it. The suggestion that the trial judge failed to explain the onus of proof properly encounters a very significant obstacle in view of the fact that the majority in Edwards v R did not say anything about the onus of proof at that point in their reasons for judgment: in each case the explanation is that there was no need to because it went without saying. It went without saying in the summing up because the point had already been made clear at the outset.  
      
       
     29 The submission by Button that it “was incumbent on the Crown to exclude alternative reasonable explanations, such as panic or some extraneous fear” might have force in a case where an accused does not testify or where there is no particular indication advanced on behalf of an accused as to what explanations there might be. It can have no force here, since Button did give evidence and advanced specific explanations, for it can be concluded that there were no others.  
      
       
     30 Even if there were any arguable merit in Button’s arguments in relation to Ground 1, they cannot be acceded to unless leave is given pursuant to r 4.  
      
       
     31 Wood CJ at CL in R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208 at [40] spoke of that appeal as being “a classic example of an ‘armchair appeal’, in which counsel not involved in the trial has gone through the record in minute detail looking for error, without reference to the manner in which the trial was conducted.” These words may not necessarily apply to counsel appearing before this Court in this case. However, some of the passages in earlier cases to which Wood CJ at CL referred bear repetition. 
      
       
     32 In R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536 Hunt CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The requirements of r 4 of the  
         Criminal Appeal Rules 
          do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the requirement that no misdirection or non direction may, without leave, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance from counsel to which he or she is entitled in the task of giving appropriate directions to the jury. If a summing-up contains some error which could easily have been cured once the judge’s attention had been drawn to it, and if counsel for the accused to whose detriment the error operates fails to comply with his or her duty to draw the judge’s attention to that error ( 
         R v Knight 
         , Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 December 1990, unreported at 46), any suggestion that such detriment automatically entitles the accused to a new trial does not strike a sympathetic chord in the hearts of those who see the right to a fair trial as operating in favour not only of the accused but also of the Crown, which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community. The  
         Criminal Appeal Act 
          1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted under one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial. There are, of course, cases in which the error made is of such a nature that, notwithstanding the failure of counsel for the accused to comply with that duty, leave will be granted to avoid a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     33 In R v Sanderson (CCA, 18 July 1994, unreported, pages 7-8) Gleeson CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “This case provides a striking and clear illustration of the reason for the presence in the Criminal Appeal Rules of rule 4. If trial counsel had apprehended that there was any significant risk that the jury might have misunderstood the true nature of their function in relation to this matter of corroboration, then the point was available to be taken by trial counsel. If the point had been taken, and if there really had been a problem, it was a problem that was capable of simple correction. It would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to permit appellants, in such circumstances, to come to the Court of Criminal Appeal and complain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.” 
         
        
       
     34 In R v DH [2000] NSWCCA 360 at [115] Stein JA (Smart and Ireland AJJ concurring) referred with approval to what Mahoney JA said in R v Jeffrey (CCA, 16 December 1993). At pages 6-7, Mahoney JA said of the principle embodied in r 4: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion, this principle plays an important part in the criminal trial process. It is important that any objection to the summing-up or that any defect or omission at the trial which can be cured or mitigated by steps taken at the trial, be raised at the time of the trial. The judge should be asked to, and should have the opportunity to, correct any error or deficiency of this kind. … But it is important that, if a citizen is to be tried, he be tried once and for all. The evil both of objections ‘held in reserve’ and raised only on appeal and of second and subsequent trials is great. 
         
        
        
         
         Errors will occur and r 4 provides for them. But unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level. Not infrequently this Court is asked to act under r 4 when the reason why the defect was not dealt with at the trial has not been established and where it is at least possible that there were tactical reasons why it was not. It is not easy for the court on appeal to satisfy itself that the reason why the matter was not raised was error rather than choice. In such circumstances, the court should be slow to act under r 4. In the end, the court must exercise the power given to it by r 4 according to the merits of the individual case. However, in my opinion, in exercising that power, the court should keep steadily in mind the function which r 4 performs in the criminal trial process.” 
         
        
       
     35 Finally, in Papakosmas v R (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 319 McHugh J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant’s conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of the evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant.” 
         
        
       
     36 The following matters must be noted. If there is an error in the trial judge’s summing up on lies, it was easily capable of simple correction by drawing it to his attention. Further, the search for an explanation for the failure to request a correction must be conducted bearing in mind the intense concentration of the parties and the judge on the issue of the lies direction on 11 and 12 December 2000. Any perceived problem cannot have been simply overlooked, in view of the following facts: the matter was examined in the afternoon of 11 December; counsel for Button then requested a list of the materials said to be lies; the Crown supplied it on 12 December 2000; the trial judge delivered his careful “judgment” including his proposed draft direction that morning; the matter was then debated for some time; and the trial judge gave counsel a lengthy opportunity to request redirections after his summing up concluded on 13 December 2000. No affidavit has been read explaining why no redirection was sought. The explanation must either be that it was not sought for tactical reasons (which might include a wholly reprehensible desire to preserve an appeal point – a tactical reason which r 4 was enacted to thwart), or that it was not sought because the actual directions given were seen to be sound, or because the actual directions given were seen not to be adverse to Button’s interests while better directions might be adverse. There can be no suggestion in this case that trial counsel were seeking to preserve an appeal point reprehensibly. In those circumstances leave should not be granted unless it is arguable that the trial judge made an error of law or that there is some other miscarriage of justice. On McHugh J’s approach there can be no error of law unless a ruling is sought, and none was. A different approach, more favourable to appellants, is that a misdirection on the burden of proof is an error of law even if no redirection is sought. But whether there was a misdirection in the burden of proof depends on what construction the jury would be likely to have understood the trial judge to be intending in the light of the summing up taken as a whole, and the impressions of those who heard him are much more likely to be reliable guides to what he was saying and what the jury would have understood him to have been saying than impressions to be gained by detailed syntactical analysis of a few words at one point of the summing up. Counsel for Button at the trial was experienced, having been called twelve years earlier. The other defence counsel concerned with the lies issue, not to mention Crown counsel, who was entitled and obliged to seek to correct plain errors in the summing up, collectively had vast experience. If one puts aside the unattractive possibility of any counsel seeking to hold a good appeal point in reserve without enlightening the trial judge, it follows that none of the six counsel thought that the trial judge had erred in relation to the burden of proof or indeed in any other way. That is a powerful indication of how the summing up should be construed. It is also a powerful indication that if the summing up should be construed so as to reveal error in relation to the burden of proof or if it contains any other error, it was not error of a kind which might produce a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     37 Accordingly leave to rely on Ground 1 is refused by reason of r 4. Even if leave were granted pursuant to r 4, Ground 1 would fail in any event.  
      
       
        
       Button: Ground 2 
        
       
     38 I agree with Kirby J. 
      
       
        
       Button: Ground 3 
        
       
     39 I agree with Kirby J.  
      
       
        
       All three grounds considered together 
        
       
     40 In oral address counsel for Button submitted, in effect, that even if neither Ground 1 nor Ground 2, nor Ground 3 by itself established a miscarriage of justice, taken in combination they did. The court has concluded that no error has been established in relation to any of these three grounds save for an erroneous direction in relation to intoxication, and it has concluded that the error did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice because of other remarks the trial judge made. Accordingly the issue of whether in combination any errors amounted to a miscarriage of justice does not arise.  
      
       
        
       Griffen: Ground 1 
        
       
     41 I agree with Kirby J.  
      
       
        
       Griffen: Ground 2 
        
       
     42 Ground 2 was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The accidental receipt by the jury of a version of the ERISP of the appellant that included questions about motive on the part of the complainant to lie constituted a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     43 Griffen’s written submissions state: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was agreed between defence counsel and the Crown Prosecutor that an edited version of the ERISP between police and the appellant would be tendered at trial. That was because the ERISP contained questions asked of the appellant to the effect of ‘Why would the complainant lie?’ However, by way of oversight, the unedited ERISP was played to the jury. All defence counsel then sought a discharge of the jury, on the basis that, having been alerted to an impermissible line of reasoning, the jury would inevitably be inclined to pursue it: trial transcript 356-361. The learned trial judge refused that application, and gave a judgment in support of doing so.” 
         
        
       
     44 They also state: 
      
       
        
         
         “Since the decision of the High Court in  
         Palmer v The Queen 
          (1998) 193 CLR 1, this question has been one of sensitivity. It is inevitable that the jury, having heard the offending question asked of the appellant by a police officer, and having heard the unsatisfactory answer of the appellant, would have been tempted to reason along the same lines. No direction could have removed that temptation.” 
         
        
       
     45 The Crown submits: 
      
       
        
         
         “The appellant’s submission about the accidental receipt by the jury of material in the appellant’s ERISP interview with the police about: 
         
        
        
         
         i. ‘reasons for the complainant to lie about him having sexual intercourse with her’, and 
         
        
        
         
         ii ‘reasons for others to say that the appellant was present at relevant times’. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that, notwithstanding the accidental admission of those questions and answers contained in the ERISP, in the context of the trial there was no miscarriage of justice. 
         
        
        
         
         The relevant ‘offending’ questions and answers ERISP Q&A 394, 395 and 402 were considered by the trial judge when dealing with applications to discharge the jury made by Counsel for Griffen and Counsel for Marr during the trial. See transcript of Judgment on application pp 1-7 of 6th December 2000 found after transcript page 364.  
         
        
        
         
         The trial of the accused commenced on 27th November 2000 and concluded on 14th December 2000. During the trial interviews, by way of ERISP recordings, between police and the appellant, Griffen, as well as the accused Button, Jarrett, Marr, and Dungay were tendered.  
         
        
        
         
         The interview of Griffen, which was played to the jury on 6th December 2000, contained 691 questions and answers. The playing of the tapes of the Appellant’s interview took about 2 hours. 
         
        
        
         
         The interviews of Button, Jarrett, Marr and Dungay were also played and they were each of similar length, for example the Button ERISP was of 502 questions and answers. 
         
        
        
         
         It is not at issue that questions referred to should not have been played to the jury as it had been agreed between the parties that they would not be. It is submitted that the reason for such agreement is consistent with the principle that it is not for the accused to establish his innocence but for the Crown to prove its case and the reasoning that it is inappropriate to speculate about motive of the complainant (or others) to make allegations. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted, however, that the playing of those questions in the interview did not cause a miscarriage of justice. The questions were not further referred to in evidence (the appellant did not give evidence) and were not canvassed in addresses before the jury. The contest between the Crown and the appellant was on two issues, the first, whether the complainant consented and the second, whether the appellant knew she was not consenting at the time of sexual intercourse. The ‘offending’ questions and answers related not to those issues but the issues of whether the appellant was one of the persons present at the relevant time and whether he had intercourse with the complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         As the appellant later said in the ERISP that he was in fact present at the relevant time and he did in fact have intercourse with the complainant the line of reasoning that the appellant complains of did not arise. If the jury were to think anything about the ‘offending’ questions and answers they were answered, almost immediately by the appellant when he admitted his presence and having intercourse.  
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that the issue here does not fall within the difficulties found in  
         Palmer 
         , nor in those cases where the prosecutor has sought to cross examine the accused or make submissions about the absence of a motive in the complainant to lie. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that the present case is distinguishable from the cases referred to additionally because the questions and answers are in an indirect piece of evidence, namely, the playing of an ERISP interview, as opposed to the direct questioning of a witness where the witnesses reactions are being assessed by the jury, or, submissions in address directed to the members of the jury.” 
         
        
       
     46 The ERISP contains the following material: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Could you give any reason why firstly [the complainant] would say that you were one of the persons responsible? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I wouldn’t know, Sarge. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Could you give any reason why Robert Donovan, sorry, Robert Jarrett, Shannon Button and Ricky Dungay would say that you were present in the car whilst [the complainant] was in the car? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I was in the car, yeah, when --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Right. 
         
        
        
         
         A. ‘Cause I’d have to be in the car if I was asleep --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Right. 
         
        
        
         
         A. --- and jumped off at South. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. No. They’re saying that you were in there whilst --- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Oh --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In, you were in the car while Julie was in there, do you understand that? So that’s after they’d been to Crescent Head. You were in the car while Julie was in the car. 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, well I’d have to be in the car from, if they did go to Crescent Head, to come back to Kempsey. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. All right. And can you give me any reason why they’d say that you were present in and out of the car when these allegations were made that she was mistreated? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I wouldn’t know, Sarge. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How well do you get along with Robert Jarrett? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I talk to him whenever, whenever I see him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yeah, and what about Shannon Button? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just the same as all, whoever’s name’s there, that’s --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What about Ricky Dungah? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yeah, whenever I see him I talk to him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. OK. So is there any reason why you’d think that they’d say, tell the police these things? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I wouldn’t know, Sarge.” 
         
        
        
         
           
         
        
       
     47 The ERISP was Exhibit P. It was played on 6 December 2000 before lunch. The problem was drawn to the trial judge’s attention just after the jury left and just before the luncheon adjournment. After argument, the trial judge delivered a judgment in which he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown Prosecutor in this case has conceded the questions should have been deleted and they were only erroneously allowed to go to the jury for the reasons I have mentioned, but the Crown argues that this is not quite the situation that was condemned in those authorities I have referred to. The interview of this particular accused went on for some time. Those questions appeared at the stage I have mentioned and that part of the interview had been played to the jury up to 1 o’clock when we took the adjournment. The rest of the interview was resumed and the accused changes his version he had given thus far. His version up to that point being to the effect he had been asleep in the car all the time and didn’t even know they went to Crescent Head and didn’t know anything about events at any other location other than when he woke up, got out of the car in Kempsey and went off to his relatives after the rape mentioned. The interview indicates he wanted to tell the truth or something to that effect and goes on from question 452 to set out that he did, in fact, go with these others to various places and they went to Dondingalong where he said he had consensual sexual relations with the complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         As I said, the Crown has conceded that the material should not have gone in. Defence counsel argue that the fact it is in is fatal, firstly so far as the trial of Mr Griffen is concerned, but counsel for the other accused say the impact also impinges upon their clients getting a fair trial because of the prejudice that might flow from the jury perhaps raising in its mind this question of the motive the complainant might have to falsely accuse people and thus bring about the problems that are referred to in the other authorities I have mentioned.  
         
        
        
         
         Clearly, as I said, the material should not have been admitted, but upon a view of all of the circumstances of it and the trial it does not seem to me that it focuses on that particular issue. It is not something that has arisen in the course of evidence otherwise or in cross-examination in the trial. It is peripheral to this extent and so far as Mr Griffen is concerned the only outcome was he ultimately changed his story and told a version in which the issue was nothing to do with why the complainant would lie, but whether she consented to the activities he acknowledges occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         As the Crown Prosecutor points out, in this trial the only issues so far as all accused are concerned appear to be whether the complainant consented or, alternatively, whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew she was not consenting. It seems to me that is the flavour of the trial thus far and thus the erroneous admission of that material before the jury, it seems to me, does not create the necessity for me to discharge the jury.”  
         
        
       
     48 Counsel for Griffen then asked for an immediate direction to the jury to disregard the offending material. The trial judge does not appear to have given any direction of that kind, but no complaint about that is now made; indeed it is said that no direction would have had utility. It may be said that a sound reason for the trial judge’s silence would have been that to give a direction would have merely made worse whatever problem already existed. Nor did counsel contend that it was wrong for the trial judge to refuse to discharge the jury. He simply contended that the events in question constituted a miscarriage of justice, because questions 394-404 would “inevitably” lead to the line of reasoning discussed in Palmer v R (1998) 193 CLR 1 “that reverses the onus”.  
      
       
     49 The offending material is of miniscule volume when considered in the light of Griffen’s record of interview, lasting two hours and with 671 questions; the similarly bulky records of interview of the other accused; and the overall length of the trial. The chance that the jury would have been attracted by the type of reasoning exposed in the offending questions is virtually nil, given that in the course of the long trial no other reference was made to it, and given that the addresses and summing up took place a week later. The offending material related to whether Griffen was present: by the time of the trial that had ceased to be an issue, as had the question whether the actus reus of the two crimes charged had taken place. The only issue was consent. Indeed Griffen later in the record of interview admitted presence and admitted the actus reus. That narrowed down even more the possibility of the jury engaging in the impermissible reasoning. The only topic on which any impermissible reasoning could have focused would be what reason the complainant had for lying about whether she was consenting or not. That was not what the offending questions were directed to. Accordingly no miscarriage of justice flowed from what happened in relation to questions 394-404.  
      
       
        
       Griffen: Ground 3 
        
       
     50 Ground 3 was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The address of the Crown Prosecutor regarding the witness Jason Cook, in the light of the approach of the Crown Prosecutor to the witness in the trial, constituted a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     51 Griffen’s written submissions state: 
      
       
        
         
         “The complainant gave evidence that one Jason Cook was present on the morning and had remonstrated with some of the men when they were sexually assaulting the complainant. For doing so, according to the complainant, Cook was bashed. There was some evidence to support the proposition that Cook had indeed been bashed on the day in question. That evidence was relied upon by the prosecution as supporting the version of the complainant. At trial, Cook was called as a prosecution witness but gave evidence that he could not remember the events of the day in question. 
         
        
        
         
         Although on a  
         voir dire 
          in the absence of the jury the Crown Prosecutor made an application under Section 38 of the  
         Evidence Act 1995 
          to cross-examine Cook, there was no such application when Cook gave evidence before the jury. Furthermore it was never put or suggested to Cook in the trial by the Crown Prosecutor that Cook was not telling the truth.  
         
        
        
         
         However, it appears from page 580.1 of the trial transcript that the Crown Prosecutor in his final address ‘invited the jury to speculate that Cook was not telling the truth’. No transcript of that address is available.” 
         
        
       
     52 The submissions also state: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was erroneous for the Crown Prosecutor not to at least try to cross-examine the prosecution witness about matters affecting his credibility, but then to proceed to criticise that witness in a way that was adverse to the interests of the accused in the trial: see  
         R v Kennedy 
          (2000) 118 A Crim R 34 at [35] to [40] and  
         R v MRW 
          (1999) 113 A Crim R 308 at [20] to [51]. 
         
        
        
         
         That was not just an infringement of the rule of fairness to the witness contained in  
         Browne v Dunn 
          (1894) 6 R 67 (HL). It was also unfair to the appellant, in that it asked the jury to draw an inference adverse to the appellant without having at least tried to establish the basis for the inference in the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     53 The written submissions of the Crown state: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is submitted that, in the context of the trial, the Crown Prosecutor’s address, as to possible reasons why the witness said that he did not remember the events of that day did not offend the rule that the Crown had to present the case fairly for these reasons: 
         
        
        
         
         i. the witness, Cook, was present in the car when the complainant was picked up near the roundabout, 
         
        
        
         
         ii. the witness was present when the events complained of took place, 
         
        
        
         
         iii. there was evidence that Cook had received a beating (having suffered injuries) consistent with the complainant’s evidence, 
         
        
        
         
         iv. there was evidence that the witness was visited and went with two of the accused shortly after the incident and before he was interviewed by police, 
         
        
        
         
         v. the witness’ statement to police was to the effect that he could not remember the events of the day in question, 
         
        
        
         
         vi. the relevant parts of the witness’ evidence was consistent with his statement (transcript page 454.12, 454.6), 
         
        
        
         
         vii. the appellant in his ERISP conceded that Cook was bashed that night, 
         
        
        
         
         viii. each of the other accused acknowledged, in their ERISP interviews, or in the case of Button, in evidence that Cook had in fact been present and had been bashed that night. (Button was the only accused who gave evidence at the trial). 
         
        
        
         
         As Cook had said from the outset that he had little memory of the night, and no memory of the relevant events, there was little or no foundation to lay an application under Section 38 that the witness was unfavourable in the relevant senses therein. 
         
        
        
         
         While it is conceded that the Crown Prosecutor should not have made the submission he made to the jury the matter was fairly resolved by the trail judge in his summing up at p. 23.7 to 26.3. 
         
        
        
         
         The jury were told by the trial judge at p 25.3 ‘So you cannot speculate on what Mr Cook might have given evidence about if his memory was better’. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that the directions to the jury about Mr Cook were sufficient and appropriate and the jury were not invited to speculate about Cook’s evidence in any way adverse to the appellant.” 
         
        
       
     54 In his summing up the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Another area of evidence you would probably look at is this matter of Mr Jason Cook. The complainant said Mr Cook remonstrated with these men, firstly at the quarry when she was being held down by Jarrett, when Marr had sexual intercourse with her and she was saying, ‘Stop it, stop it’ and then when Button followed. She said Mr Cook said, if they did not stop he was going to put them all in when we got back to town, then everyone stopped what they were doing. Then Button threatened Mr Cook he was going to bash him and when they drove a bit further on and down a lane, Button and Jarrett did bash Mr Cook and he bled profusely. Later, at the Tourist Information Centre, Jarrett and Button again bashed Mr Cook and kicked him several times. He bled a lot more and someone wiped blood from his face and you have the photograph of the bloodstained towel found in the boot later that day. 
         
        
        
         
         In their records of interview each of the accused acknowledged that Jason Cook was bashed although none of the accused conceded it was because he remonstrated with them for sexually assaulting [the complainant]. Marr said, when Shannon was getting a head job, Jason was yelling black cunts, but Mr Marr said Jason was just drunk and lost it. Jarrett said Jason had been nagging most of the night and Shannon busted him, but Mr Jarrett did not know why. Button said Jason was carrying on saying, ‘You bunch of black bastards’ and going on and calling us all this heap of shit, so Mr Button clouted him. Dungay said, Jason called Mr Button a ‘black cunt’ and Shannon smashed Cookie. Griffen said he saw Jason get punched, but didn’t know what for and could not recall Jason saying anything. 
         
        
        
         
         Well as we know, Mr Jason Cook was called to give evidence, but he said he simply could not remember much about that night at all. He was in the car, but had no recollection of where they went. He walked home, but he did not know where from. He was missing one of his shoes, he had a bleeding nose, but did not know he had been hit until the police told him and he did not see anyone hit him. He had had a fair bit to drink and had smoked a lot of marijuana that night. 
         
        
        
         
         Well I think it is only fair to say, members of the jury, that Mr Cook’s evidence does not help you much at all. It confirms that he was hit, at least in the face and he did leave the rest of the group at some stage. His mother, Mrs Carmel Cook confirmed he was injured when he got home and saw he had scratches all over his body, from the waist up and he had no shirt on. So you cannot speculate on what Mr Cook might have given evidence about if his memory was better. The fact of his injuries and the admission by, I think just about all of the accused, that Cook was abusing them, could be said to be support for the version given by the complainant, but you have to be careful in assessing that material, because we do not have from Mr Cook why he was abusing them. From the Crown’s point of view it is consistent with the version given by [the complainant]. From the defence point of view it was an incident not associated with any of the sexual activities of those involved. 
         
        
        
         
         However, the bashing of Jason Cook is an objective fact in the trial and clearly he was assaulted on more than one occasion and bled quite profusely. Firstly, not far from the events at the quarry and later at the Tourist Information Centre before the journey to Dondingalong. That fact is relied upon by the Crown in relation to the question of whether the complainant consented to the sexual acts relied upon and why she did not put up any resistance. She told you she was frightened what might happen to her if she tried to make a run for it, that, in effect, she realised that resistance was useless. The fact that Jason Cook was dealt with so savagely might assist you in assessing the atmosphere that prevailed in this black Ford car during these hours and the state of mind of the accused persons and the state of mind of the complainant. You have seen her and observed her, you would perhaps ask yourselves whether she impressed you as the sort of woman who would be seeking sexual favours from all these men, first at the quarry and later at Dondingalong in that atmosphere of violence shown towards Mr Cook, but that is a matter for you.” 
         
        
        
       That part of the summing up is not the subject of complaint.  
        
       
     55 The first difficulty in relation to this ground is that though counsel for Marr complained, at the close of the address presented by Crown counsel, that “he has invited the jury to speculate that Cook was not telling the truth”, he did not ask for a discharge of the jury or ask for any redirection. Nor did any other counsel, including counsel for Griffen, on that day or on the following day, 12 December 2000. Nor did any counsel ask for a redirection after the summing up. Accordingly leave is needed under r 4. The affidavit of counsel who appeared for Griffen at the trial deals with his failure to seek redirections in relation to the mental element of the offence of sexual intercourse without consent, intoxication and lies, but not with the failure to make any application in relation to the Crown address.  
      
       
     56 The second difficulty is that given that Cook said he could not remember the events in question, it might have been very difficult to make a successful application under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995.  
      
       
     57 The third difficulty is that it was open to counsel for any accused to go further than the Crown could have done under s 38, since they each had a right of full cross-examination. Three defence counsel did cross-examine briefly, but not counsel for Griffen. It is true that at that stage the Crown had not specifically raised the issue of whether and why Cook was not telling the truth, but it was an available question.  
      
       
     58 The fourth difficulty is that the written submissions do not identify what inference adverse to Griffen it was which the Crown was asking the jury to draw. Indeed the failure of Griffith to have placed before this Court evidence of what the Crown actually said makes it difficult to deal with the argument. It seems that addresses were not recorded, but it would have been possible to file an affidavit of some lawyer who heard the address.  
      
       
     59 In oral argument it was suggested that the jury might speculate that the reason why Cook said he could not remember that he had been bashed was that the accused had done it, and that he had said he could not remember untruthfully, either because he was afraid of them or because he was an associate of theirs. If he was afraid of them, that reflected badly on them. If he was an associate of theirs, and was prepared to perjure himself, that too reflected badly on him. In my opinion the incident was too minor to create a possible miscarriage of justice. To reason as it was suggested the jury might reason would have been to speculate. The trial judge distinctly and explicitly forbad the jury to speculate about what Cook would have said if his memory had been better. There is no sufficient reason to suppose that there was any possibility that the jury would either attribute any significance to whatever it was that Crown counsel said, or failed to comply with the trial judge’s direction.  
      
       
     60 Since it has not been shown that any miscarriage of justice has occurred by reason of the conduct of the trial by the trial judge after the Crown address, there is no reason why leave should be granted under r 4.  
      
       
        
       Griffen: Ground 4 
        
       
     61 I agree with Kirby J.  
      
       
        
       Griffen: Ground 5 
        
       
     62 I agree with Kirby J.  
      
       
        
       Griffen: Ground 6 
        
       
     63 Ground 6 was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned trial judge misdirected the jury about the approach to lies relied upon by the prosecution.” 
         
        
       
     64 Griffen submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was an implicit reversal of the correct onus in those directions with regard to alternative explanations for the telling of a lie at page 27 paragraph 1. It was for the prosecution to prove that the reason for the telling of a lie was consciousness of guilt; it was not for the jury to determine whether it accepted the explanation of the appellant. The effect of the erroneous passage is exacerbated by the explicit reference to the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         None of the other directions given by the learned trial judge about the onus being on the prosecution to prove the elements of the offence could have cured this error. The jury may well have understood that, in the general context of the prosecution bearing the onus of proving its case, it was up to the jury to determine whether, with regard to the particular question of lies, it accepted the explanation of the appellant.” 
         
        
       
     65 This argument is similar to the second and third arguments advanced by Button in relation to Ground 1 of Button’s Notice of Appeal. The other Button argument was not advanced. The argument should be rejected for the same reasons as the reasons given for rejecting the corresponding arguments of Button. As the Crown submitted, there is no reason to suppose that the jury would have misunderstood the directions in the manner for which Griffen now contends. 
      
       
     66 Further, r 4 should be applied to debar Griffen from relying on this ground. The affidavit of counsel who appeared for Griffen at the trial (who was not the counsel appearing before this Court) says that he did not seek a redirection on lies for any tactical reason and thought them to be correct. Indeed, not only did counsel for Griffen fail to seek a redirection, but the impugned part of the direction was actually urged upon the trial judge by counsel for Griffen. It is true that counsel for Griffen, unlike counsel for Button, has expressly excluded the possibility of tactical reasons existing for the failure to object. It is also true that counsel for Griffen at the trial was inexperienced. The fact remains that collectively the counsel appearing who were concerned with the lies direction were experienced and that none noticed any error in the summing up on lies. That points very strongly against any miscarriage of justice. No argument to the effect that any error of the type discussed in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 was advanced; indeed it was specifically disavowed. The leave needed under r 4 to rely on Ground 6 is refused. Even if it were granted, Ground 6 would fail.  
      
       
        
       Cumulative effect of errors 
        
       
     67 Griffen submitted that the cumulative effect of the second-sixth grounds in his Notice of Appeal should be taken into account by this Court in determining whether a miscarriage of justice has been established. In my opinion, even taken together, the grounds do not establish any miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
        
       Proviso 
        
       
     68 Even if Griffen had demonstrated any error, the case would be an appropriate one for the application of the proviso. The Crown case was extremely powerful. It was greatly assisted by Griffen’s admission. The complainant was completely unshaken in her evidence. The probability of any one in her position consenting to the acts done to her in the circumstances in which they were done is extremely slight. An examination of her evidence reduces that probability to nil. Even if any or all of the errors alleged have been made out, they are of a marginal, peripheral and insignificant character compared to the force of the Crown case.  
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     69 Despite the arguments advanced by each of the counsel for the appellants, and the conspicuous ability with which they were advanced, the appeals fail. I propose the following orders. 
      
       
        
       1. The appeal of Button against conviction be dismissed. 
        
        
       2. The appeal of Griffen against conviction be dismissed.  
        
       
     70 GREG JAMES, J: I agree with the orders proposed by Heydon, JA. and with the reasons given by him and by Kirby, J. I only wish to add some short further observations to what is said by Kirby, J. concerning the construction of the aggravating circumstance in s.61J(2)(c). 
      
       
     71 In my view, the degree of proximity to others which could amount to physical presence, as required by the case law, such as to satisfy that element in the requirement of being ""in the company of another person or persons"", is not fixed in absolute terms. 
      
       
     72 That same requirement of physical presence also exists as a relevant feature to discriminate between accessories before the fact and principals in the second degree. The distinction between the liability of, eg., a lookout and that of others more nearly present would seem to turn on the degree of physical separation from the scene of the crime and the nature of the involvement in the criminal conduct. 
      
       
     73 A lookout around the corner or at a location physically detached or remote from the scene of the principal's activities would not lend encouragement or reassurance to that principal by reason of being at the scene and able to influence the events occurring there. A similar distinction is drawn by Street, CJ. in Regina v. Johns [1978] 1 NSWLR 282 at 286D-286F and 289G-290D between accessories before the fact and principals in the second degree (formerly described as accessories at the fact). 
      
       
     74 The analogy one could propose of a robbery performed by one person physically taking property from the person of a victim who is directly threatened by an accomplice sniper armed with a rifle, a long distance away, is such that it would be difficult in logic and morality to conceive of any reason why the offence should not be that of robbery in company. The purpose is shared, the requirement of presence is satisfied by the influence of the sniper on the criminal conduct constituting the offence. There is a sufficient effective proximity. I do not consider that the law should so little reflect the considerations of logic and morality when it comes to construing either an element of such an offence as this or such an aggravating circumstance as artificially to limit the ambit of words which after all are common English expressions. 
      
       
     75 That analogy illustrates that the concept of presence includes a purposive element which is to be related to the influence or potential influence of the other person or person with whom an accused is alleged to be in company having retard to where that person is located. The purpose and the nature of the criminal acts may cause the relevant physical distance to be more or less, having regard to that influence to which I have referred. 
      
       
     76 The concept does not merely relate to physical distance. In any given case appropriate directions will need to be given ensuring the jury understands not only the geographical connection but also the connection in purpose. 
      
       
     77 KIRBY J: 
      
       
        
       BUTTON: Ground 1 
        
       
     78 I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Heydon JA in draft. I agree with his Honour's conclusion in relation to this ground, and the reasons his Honour provides. 
      
       
        
       BUTTON: Ground 2 
        
       
     79 Many of the accused, including Mr Button, were affected by drugs and alcohol. The directions on intoxication were therefore given in general terms. The complaint made by Mr Button in respect of those directions was also made by Mr Griffen. It is dealt with below in the context of the Griffen appeal. Error has been demonstrated. However, as in the case of Mr Griffen, no point was taken at the trial by counsel then appearing for Mr Button. Rule 4 therefore applies. The issue arises whether, in the context of Mr Button's trial, there may have been a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     80 Mr Button said that, in the course of the New Years celebrations, he had consumed a substantial quantity of alcohol, and smoked marijuana. He described himself as ""pretty drunk, and stoned"". He gave the following evidence: (T 547) 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. Not knowing what is going on, out of it? 
          
         A. I just, you know just like not right out of it probably just - I knew what I was doing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You knew what you were doing so you were just a bit out of it were you? 
          
         A. Yes."" 
         
        
       
     81 It was a strong Crown case. The complainant had made an immediate complaint. She had sustained injuries consistent with her complaint. 
      
       
     82 Mr Button gave evidence at the trial. He provided a detailed recollection of the events of that day, and, indeed, some recollection of the evening before, New Years Eve, including his consumption of alcohol. He described the circumstances in which the complainant entered the car, including his conversation with her before she got in. Mr Button described the journey to the quarry and what happened thereafter. He described the way in which the accused, Marr, ""jumped"" into the back seat and had sexual intercourse with the complainant. 
      
       
     83 Mr Button then described the journey from the quarry to Kempsey, and the altercation with Mr Cook. He furnished a description of the journey from Kempsey to Dongdingalong. He went for a swim. He returned somewhat refreshed. Upon his return he noticed the accused, Jarrett, coming out of the bushes. He asked the complainant, ""Are you going to see me?"" She responded, according to his testimony, by saying, ""Yes"". They then went into the bushes and had sexual intercourse. The detail of his evidence coincided with that of the complainant, apart from his insistence that she had consented. 
      
       
     84 Mr Button said that, whilst he was alone with the complainant, he had the following conversation: (T 534) 
      
       
        
         
         ""I said, 'Why don't you come and live with me?' And she said, 'where?' I said 'Out to Billy Goat at my dad's, Billy Goat Hill.'"" 
         
        
       
     85 His Honour dealt with the issue of intoxication, in the context of the arguments put by Mr McColm, counsel for Mr Button. He correctly identified the issue which the jury was obliged to consider. His summing up included the following: (S/U 44) 
      
       
        
         
         ""One other matter of considerable importance that Mr McColm addressed you about, is the condition of Mr Button. He had had a lot to drink that night and was clearly very much affected by liquor. So much so, that when they got to Dongdingalong, Button went for a swim to try to clear his head and to some extent it did, but it also confirms that the was not present at any of the other alleged activities there, on the boot of the car et cetera and when he emerged from the creek he simply asked the complainant for sex, 'Are you going to see me' and she did. This is where the question of his state of sobriety comes in. Was he so affected by liquor that he did not realise there was a possibility she was not consenting? In the result Mr McColm argues you could not be satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused and you must find him not guilty."" 
         
        
       
     86 I do not accept, therefore, that the error of the trial Judge, in his earlier directions on intoxication, may have given rise to a miscarriage of justice. I would refuse leave under Rule 4. 
      
       
        
       BUTTON: Ground 3 
        
       
     87 Complaint is made on behalf of the appellant Button concerning his Honour's directions as to the mens rea required to prove an offence under s61J of the Crimes Act 1900. The same complaint is made by Mr Griffen, and is considered in the context of that appeal. For the reasons there given, there was no error by his Honour. Ground 3 should be rejected. 
      
       
        
       GRIFFEN: Ground 1 
        
       
     88 Ground 1 of the Notice of Appeal was in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The learned trial Judge erred in failing to direct a verdict of Not Guilty with regard to the offences that featured the aggravating feature ""in company"". 
         
        
       
     89 Mr Griffen faced two counts of aggravated sexual assault (s61J of the Crimes Act 1900), the circumstance of aggravation being that he was in the company of another person, or persons (s61J(2)(c)). The first count was based upon an act of fellatio; the second upon vaginal intercourse, the accused suggesting in each case that the complainant had consented. It was common ground that both acts occurred fifty metres from other members of the group. Counsel for Mr Griffen argued that such geographical separation meant that the offence was not committed in company. His Honour, therefore, ought to have directed a verdict on the circumstance of aggravation, leaving it to the jury to determine whether the crime of sexual assault had been established in the circumstances identified by each count. 
      
       
     90 His Honour found that the evidence was capable of establishing that the offences were committed in company. The issue was left to the jury. Mr Griffen was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault on both counts. 
      
       
     91 Before going to the terms of his Honour's judgment, I should set out more fully the Crown case. The complainant entered the vehicle early on New Year's Day. The vehicle was driven to a quarry. The complainant was then held down by one of the five accused whilst other members had sexual intercourse. Mr Griffen was not the perpetrator of these crimes, although, on the Crown case, he was present throughout. The vehicle was then driven to another location, Dongdingalong, which was remote bushland. Certain group members took it in turns to sexually assault the complainant. According to the complainant, after the accused Button had sexual intercourse, she walked out of the bushes towards the car. As she approached the car, Mr Griffen said to her: ""Come up this way."" The other men were nearby. Mr Griffen started walking in the direction ""that he wanted me to go"". The complainant responded by saying to Mr Griffen these words: (T9) 
      
       
        
         
         ""A. I told him that I was in enough pain and did not want to do anything."" 
         
        
       
     92 One of the group (Bobby) Jarrett, then said this: (T9) 
      
       
        
         
         ""A. Bobby told me to just do it or I would not be going home."" 
         
        
       
     93 The complainant then walked fifty metres into the bush, following Mr Griffen. She provided her reasons for having done so in these words: (T10) 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. Did you go with Mr Griffen? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why did you go with him? 
          
         A. Because I was scared. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why were you scared? 
          
         A. Because I was on my own and I had five blokes there pressuring me to do stuff that I didn't want to do and I felt threatened if I did not do it I would not make it home."" 
         
        
       
     94 In his judgment concerning the application for a directed verdict, Viney DCJ carefully reviewed the authorities. In determining whether the sexual assault was committed in company the circumstances were relevant. It was a remote area. The complainant was alone with the five accused. On the Crown case, the offences committed by Mr Griffen followed other acts of non-consensual intercourse where he had been present. His Honour said this: (p 3) 
      
       
        
         
         ""In normal circumstances one might say fifty metres distance from other people is perhaps sufficient to take that accused away from the company of others. But when one looks at the situation it seems to me that the aggravating feature in this case is the coercive effect of a number of men congregated together, while individuals on occasions, perhaps more than one, perpetrated sexual acts on the complainant."" 
         
        
       
     95 His Honour, having drawn attention to the threat said to have been made by Bobby Jarrett, then said this: (p 4) 
      
       
        
         
         ""It seems to me the fact that Griffen took her to a spot some fifty metres away does not, of itself, take his sexual acts out of the company of the others in the circumstances of this case. 
         
        
        
         
         It seems to me it is a matter of fact for the jury. ..."" 
         
        
       
     96 In challenging that ruling, the appellant, broadly, relied upon two arguments. The first was based upon the construction of the section creating the offence of aggravated assault (s61J Crimes Act 1900). The second was based upon the authorities, where the expression ""in company"" has been considered, whether robbery in company (s97(1) Crimes Act) or sexual assault in company (s61J). According to the appellant, the cases, whatever else they may say, insist upon the physical presence of a co-offender during the commission of the offence. 
      
       
     97 Dealing, first, with the construction argument, s61J is in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         "" 
         61J 
           
         Aggravated sexual assault 
         
        
        
         
         (1) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) In this section,  
         circumstances of aggravation  
         means circumstances in which: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender threatens to inflict actual bodily arm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby by means of an offensive weapon or instrument, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) the alleged victim is under the age of 16 years, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (e) the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (f) the alleged victim has a serious physical disability, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (g) the alleged victim has a serious intellectual disability."" 
           
          
         
        
       
     98 The offence of aggravated sexual assault, therefore, required the conjunction of two matters: 
      
       
     · Sexual intercourse with another person without that person's consent, where the offender knows the person is not consenting, 
      
       
     · in circumstances of aggravation. 
      
       
     99 Some of the circumstances of aggravation in s61J(2) are defined narrowly, and others expansively. Subsection (2)(c), according to the appellant, is defined narrowly, whereas (2)(a), (b) and (e) are all defined expansively. Subsection (2)(a) and 2(b), for instance, permit variation in the time at which the circumstances of aggravation may occur (""at the time of, or immediately before or after the commission of the offence ...""), as well as matters of geography (in the case of the secondary victim) (""present or nearby""). Subsection (2)(e) also permits variation on the question of authority. Subsection 2(c) relied upon by the Crown in this case, however, permits no such variation. 
      
       
     100 Hence the Crown must, according to the appellant, prove that sexual intercourse took place in company, that is the physical presence of another person or persons. Sexual intercourse is defined, relevantly, as penetration. According to the appellant, penetration must therefore take place in the physical presence of another person. 
      
       
     101 There is force in these arguments, although they choose to concentrate upon one aspect of the offence, namely the act of sexual intercourse, that is, penetration. That aspect is obviously fundamental. However, the offence involves other elements, namely, an absence of consent, and knowledge, on the part of the offender, that the victim is not consenting. How should the offence be defined for the purposes of determining whether it occurs ""in company""? 
      
       
     102 It is not difficult to think of situations where defining the offence by reference to the act of penetration may seem unreasonable. Assume that a group of men bound and gagged a female at one location. Assume, somewhat incongruously, that out of concern for each other's privacy, they made an arrangement whereby each member of the group would, in rotation, have sexual intercourse with the victim, whilst other members waited their turn one hundred metres away in the bush. The victim, in that example, would be powerless because of the actions of the group. Yet penetration would, in each case, occur in the absence of other members of the group. Is it not aggravated sexual assault in company? If it is, is there a difference where, as here, instead of binding and gagging the victim, her will is broken by the group at one location, and penetration, for reasons of privacy, takes place at another? 
      
       
     103 Before fixing upon a construction of the section, it is convenient to consider the second argument, which depends upon the way in which the cases have defined the phrase ""in company"". Most of the cases are concerned with robbery in company, rather than sexual assault. You would expect the same meaning in the context of both offences, although there are obvious differences between the offence of robbery and the offence of sexual assault. The common purpose in robbery is the taking of property for division between participants. Sexual offences involve individual gratification. The common purpose is in achieving, or facilitating, that objective. 
      
       
     104 In The Queen v Joyce [1968] NZLR 1070, a service station owner was held up at gunpoint. Money was demanded. The accused was in the general vicinity, but not present at the time of the hold-up. The Court of Appeal held that the conviction of robbery in company could not stand. They said this: (at 1075) 
      
       
        
         
         ""In the case of a charge laid under that paragraph, in our opinion, the Crown must establish that at least two persons were physically present at the time the robbery was committed or the assault occurred. We reach this conclusion for the reason that we are of opinion that the Legislature, in enacting s235(b) carrying as it does a higher penalty, intended to provide for cases where the victim was confronted by two or more persons acting in concert."" 
         
        
       
     105 In the context of a charge of robbery in company, Walters J made the following comment in R v Cooper (1978) 17 SASR 472: (at 477) 
      
       
        
         
         ""... I think the intendment of the section is to prevent the commission of bodily violence by persons coming together with an intent to rob and to assist one another in the commission and the assault."" 
         
        
       
     106 His Honour added: (at 477/8) 
      
       
        
         
         ""Thus I think the participation by one party in the common unlawful purpose of an assault with intent to rob merely by his giving assistance or encouragement, such as is afforded by keeping watch to prevent the discovery of the other or others actually present together and committing their external or overt operations, or by his being near enough to give physical assistance if it be required, would not be enough to support a charge under s158(b) of the Act. In other words, I think that actual physical participation in the assault is essential."" 
         
        
       
     107 The Court of Appeal in New Zealand again considered the phrase ""in company"" in R v Galey [1985] 1 NZLR 230. A Japanese sailor entered an hotel. Two men in the hotel concocted a plan to rob him. With the assistance of a woman (who ultimately gave evidence for the Crown), the sailor was lured from the hotel. The two men followed at a distance. They walked separately. One of them, Hooper, attacked the sailor and robbed him. The other, Galey, was not far behind. The sailor, in his description of the attack, only saw one man. He was not conscious of the presence of Galey. Galey was nonetheless charged with robbery in company. 
      
       
     108 The Crown presented the case against Galey upon the basis that he was an accomplice of Hooper, who was the principal offender. The Court (McMullin and Greigg JJ and Sir Clifford Richmond) said this: (at 232) 
      
       
        
         
         ""With the wisdom of hindsight it may well have been open to the jury, on the basis of the girl's evidence, to treat Galey as being physically present at the robbery, not just as a bystander giving encouragement to Hooper, but for the purpose of giving physical assistance to Hooper if required."" 
         
        
       
     109 However, given the way in which the Crown put its case, the question was whether the presence at the scene of an accomplice, at the level of participation alleged against Galey, was capable of transforming the robbery committed by Hooper into one committed by Hooper and Galey, as alleged in the indictment. The New Zealand Act, in terms similar to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), identified a number of circumstances of aggravation in respect of robbery, including being ""together with another person or persons"". Commenting upon that section, the Court said this: (at 233/4) 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is clear enough in relation to (a) and (c) that the legislature has taken as aggravating circumstances matters directly related to the degree of violence, or threats of violence, employed by the offender. We believe that the expression 'being together with any other person or persons' should be construed as having a somewhat similar purpose, and therefore as intended to apply only in situations where the presence together is proved of two or more persons having the common intention to use their combined force, either in any event or as circumstances might require, directly in the perpetration of the crime."" 
         
        
       
     110 The Court added, commenting upon the decision in The Queen v Joyce (supra): (at 234) 
      
       
        
         
         ""Nevertheless the judgment in  
         Joyce 
          strengthens our view that s235(1)(b) was intended to apply only to cases where the forces of two or more persons, acting in concert, are deployed against the victim in the actual commission of the offence.  
         Joyce 
          demonstrates how a lack of physical proximity may negative the statutory requirement of 'being together'."" 
         
        
       
     111 In The Queen v Brougham (1986) 43 SASR 187, the Full Court of South Australia (King CJ, Mohr and von Doussa JJ) considered the offence of robbery in company. Two men hired a taxi. During the course of the journey one of them directed the taxi driver to stop. The driver then demanded the fare. One of the men, Brougham, then struck the taxi driver and demanded the money he was carrying. The other man assisted in various ways, but did not physically strike the driver. Brougham was convicted of robbery in company. He appealed, asserting that his conviction could not be sustained because both men must physically participate before the offence could be characterised as robbery in company. 
      
       
     112 The Court rejected that argument. King CJ (with whom other members of the Court agreed) said this: (at 191) 
      
       
        
         
         ""The true meaning of the provision emerges from the authorities just cited. A person commits a robbery, or an assault with intent, in company where that person participates in the robbery or assault together with another or others in the sense that the victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons or that the forces of two or more persons are deployed against the victim. It is not necessary that more than one participant actually strike or rob the victim; it is sufficient that the accused and one or more other participants be physically present for the common purpose of robbing, or assaulting with intent, and of physically participating if required. 
         
        
       
     113 KIng CJ said this, commenting upon the judgment of Walters J in The Queen v Cooper (supra): (at 191) 
      
       
        
         
         ""His Honour was stressing in that passage that participation in the common purpose at a distance or by mere encouragement or keeping a lookout was not sufficient. I do not think that his Honour was suggesting that presence at the scene with the intention of physically participating if required was insufficient."" 
         
        
       
     114 In R v Crozier (unreported, CCA, 8 March 1996), the appellant was convicted of the offence involved in this appeal, namely aggravated sexual assault in company (s61J). The Crown case was that the complainant was offered a lift in a vehicle in which there were two men. One of the men got into the back of the vehicle and had sexual intercourse with the complainant. The other man remained in the front of the vehicle. The issue on appeal was the adequacy of the trial Judge's direction to the jury as to the meaning of the circumstance of aggravation, being ""in company"". Grove J (with whom Cole JA and Ireland J agreed) said this: (at 10) 
      
       
        
         
         ""The matter was therefore left to the jury on the basis that the mere presence of Fitzgerald during the alleged offence by the Appellant amounted to 'company' so as to provide a circumstance of aggravation as defined. Mere presence of a person is not sufficient."" 
         
        
       
     115 His Honour then referred to the passage in King CJ's judgement in R v Brougham, set out above. He continued: (at 11) 
      
       
        
         
         ""I would apply a similar approach to the allegation of the circumstance of aggravation in this case in assessing the requirements for proof that the alleged offence occurred 'in company'. The evidence does not show that Fitzgerald was other than entirely passive during the action of the Appellant when he returned from his stated intention of urinating and got into the back seat of the car with the complainant. There is no evidence that Fitzgerald was encouraging the Appellant by word or action, indeed the complainant said that she recalled that he may have had a can of drink."" 
         
        
       
     116 The Court concluded that the evidence could not sustain the circumstance of aggravation. 
      
       
     117 Finally, in R v Leoni [1999] NSWCCA 14, the Court of Criminal Appeal again considered the offence of robbery in company. The prosecution arose out of what is termed a home invasion. A woman opened the door of her home, whereupon a number of individuals rushed into her home. One was disguised with a balaclava, and carried a weapon. Money was demanded. The robbers separated, searching the house. The appellant said that he only entered the foyer entrance of the home, although he spoke to others from that position in the presence of the victim. Adams J (with whom Abadee and Barr JJ agreed) made the following observation on the facts: (para 13) 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is clear on the appellant's case, that he was aware that Ms Walsh knew of his presence, at least at the front door, a position from which, of course, he was able to assist the other two offenders, if necessary. Furthermore, it is clear that the appellant at all times envisaged that Brincat and Crowther would enter the house, so that one would be in the position to assist the other in the robbery, if it became necessary."" 
         
        
       
     118 His Honour referred to the judgment of King CJ in R v Brougham (at para 16) and then said this: (para 17) 
      
       
        
         
         ""It seems to me that the essence of this offence is not that the accused intended that the victim should be overborne by the presence of more than one robber or that he should intend to come to the assistance of the other if necessary. In my opinion, the only relevant intent is that the offender placed himself in the position in which he knew or expected that the victim would know of his presence and ability to assist in the robbery if called on to do so."" 
         
        
       
     119 His Honour added: (para 20) 
      
       
        
         
         ""In my opinion, presence at the scene with the intention of physically participating, if required, is sufficient to satisfy the section, even if that presence is unknown to the victim. However, if the offender makes his presence known to the victim so that, to use the words of the Chief Justice in  
         Brougham 
          'the victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons' that will be sufficient to satisfy the section even if the offender did not, as it happened, intend to physically participate if required."" 
         
        
       
     120 What emerges from these cases? A number of propositions can be stated: 
      
       
     · First, the statutory definition (s61J(2)(c)) requires that the offender be ""in the company of another person or persons"". 
      
       
     · Secondly, the accused and such person, or persons, must share a common purpose (either to rob, or as here, sexually assault). 
      
       
     · Thirdly, the cases appear to assume that each participant is physically present. 
      
       
     · Fourthly, participation in the common purpose without being physically present (for example, as a look-out or as an accessory before the fact) is not enough. 
      
       
     · Fifthly, the perspective of the victim (being confronted by the combined force or strength or two or more persons) is relevant, although not determinative. If two or more persons are present, and share the same purpose, they will be ""in company"", even if the victim was unaware of the other person. 
      
       
     121 The physical presence of another is, therefore, required for the crime to be committed in company. However, two questions remain. First, what is meant by physical presence? Secondly, in respect of which aspect of the crime identified by s61J is physical presence required? That is the construction question identified earlier. Is it penetration, as the appellant asserts, or would it be enough that the events giving rise to the accused's knowledge of the absence of consent took place in company? 
      
       
     122 For the purposes of this appeal, I believe it is really only necessary to answer the first question, that is: what is meant by physical presence, and whether, in the context of this case, the separation of 50 metres was capable of satisfying that requirement?  
      
       
     123 Physical presence is an elastic concept. The concept is best explained by example. Assume the robbery of a large warehouse, with a number of persons involved. The robbers scatter in search of valuables. They may, at any point, be separated by 50 metres and yet, throughout, will remain ""in company"". Assume that one robber demanded the Bankcard of the owner, and his PIN number. He then separated from his companions, went to the bank one kilometre away, and used the card to withdraw cash, before returning to the warehouse. Is the theft of that money part of the crime committed in company? The Bankcard and the PIN number were, no doubt, obtained with the aid of the coercion exerted by the group. 
      
       
     124 Take another illustration, closer to the facts in this appeal. Assume a sexual assault in a large house, involving a number of individuals. If, for reasons of privacy, the victim were taken to an adjacent bedroom, and the door closed, the offence would plainly still be one committed in company. And the result, I suggest, would be no different if the bedroom were upstairs, so that some distance separated the offender at the time of penetration, and other members of the group. 
      
       
     125 However, there must be limits. The point must be reached where the separation between the offender and the group is such that the offence can no longer be characterised as being in the presence of a group. How are those limits determined? I believe the learned trial Judge accurately identified the test. The test is the coercive effect of the group. There must be such proximity as would enable the inference that the coercive effect of the group operated, either to embolden or reassure the offender in committing the crime, or to intimidate the victim into submission. 
      
       
     126 Here, the context was a remote area, and five persons who shared a common purpose to sexually assault the victim. In that context, applying that test, and assuming, for the purposes of argument that the offence is defined by reference to penetration (although I believe that remains an open question), the offence was capable of being regarded as having been committed in the presence of the group. His Honour was therefore right not to direct a verdict on the circumstance of aggravation. I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       GRIFFEN: Ground 2 
        
       
     127 I agree with Heydon JA. 
      
       
        
       GRIFFEN: Ground 3 
        
       
     128 I agree with Heydon JA. 
      
       
        
       GRIFFEN: Ground 4 
        
       
     129 Ground 4 was in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         ""4. The learned trial judge misdirected the jury regarding the mental element of the offender in the crime of sexual intercourse without consent."" 
         
        
       
     130 The Crown had to prove that Mr Griffen knew the complainant was not consenting to sexual intercourse. It is a subjective test. What is important is Mr Griffen's state of mind, not that of a hypothetical person. 
      
       
     131 Here his Honour, according to the appellant, impermissibly suggested an objective test. Attention was drawn to the following words used by his Honour: (S/U 7) 
      
       
        
         
         ""The Crown asks you to infer, from other facts which it has set out to prove, that he did indeed know, that he must have known."" 
         
        
       
     132 Attention was also drawn to the following: (S/U 7) 
      
       
        
         
         ""... you would be entitled to conclude that this was such an obvious sign of the absence of consent, that the accused could not have helped but know it."" 
         
        
       
     133 It was acknowledged that in proving intention, in the absence of an admission, the Crown must inevitably rely upon inference. It was also conceded that it was permissible to rely upon what was termed ""an objective mode of reasoning"", that is, pointing to certain objective facts and what they revealed, in order to infer the accused's subjective state of mind. However, where an objective mode of reasoning is used to arrive at a subjective state of mind, care must be exercised lest the jury gain the impression that an objective state of mind will suffice. Here, according to the appellant, the directions inappropriately suggested an objective test. 
      
       
     134 Our attention was drawn to R v O'Meagher (1997) 101 A Crim R 196, where Smart J said this: (at 197) 
      
       
        
         
         ""There is a real danger in the present case that having regard to the direction given, the jury may not have focused on the state of mind of the accused but on the objective test of whether it must have been apparent or it appeared that the complainant was not consenting."" 
         
        
       
     135 The Crown submitted that, in context, his Honour's directions made it clear that the focus was upon the state of mind of each accused. No complaint was made by counsel for Mr Griffen (nor, indeed, by any counsel). Rule 4 applies. 
      
       
     136 The summing up, taken as a whole, does I believe, make it clear that the jury was concerned with the state of mind of the accused. His Honour said this: (S/U 6) 
      
       
        
         
         ""The next element that has to be proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, is that the accused knew she was not consenting. The position taken by all of the accused is that she did consent, or they believed she was consenting to what happened at these various places. But the accused does not have to prove she consented or even that he believed she was consenting. The Crown has to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused knew (the complainant) was not consenting to the act of sexual intercourse, with which he is charged."" 
         
        
       
     137 There followed directions, which included the passages about which complaint is made. The directions were as follows: (S/U 6/7) 
      
       
        
         
         ""You might ask, how, in the absence of an admission by the accused, the Crown can prove that he was aware she did not consent. The Crown asks you to infer, from other facts which it has set out to prove, that he did indeed know, that he must have known. For instance, at the quarry, if you accept beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence of (the complainant), that she asked Mark Marr a number of times not to let anything happen to her, that she was held down on the back seat there by Jarrett while Marr had sexual intercourse with her and that she was crying and telling them to stop. If you accept that evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, then the Crown says, you would be entitled to conclude that this was such an obvious sign of the absence of consent, that the accused could not have helped but know it."" 
         
        
       
     138 I believe, in context, his Honour's words, ""he must have known"", and the concluding paragraph, simply mean that you, the Jury, would inevitably infer knowledge on the part of the accused if the evidence identified were accepted. 
      
       
     139 I would reject this ground. 
      
       
        
       GRIFFEN: Ground 5 
        
       
     140 Ground 5 was in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         ""5. The learned trial judge misdirected the jury regarding the interplay between the mental element of the offender in the crime of sexual intercourse without consent and intoxication."" 
         
        
       
     141 Mr Griffen, like many of the accused, had consumed a substantial quantity of both alcohol and marijuana on New Years Eve and in the course of New Years Day. 
      
       
     142 It was important in these circumstances, according to the appellant, that careful directions should be given concerning intoxication. Intoxication was relevant to the Crown's obligation to prove the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting. However, his Honour, according to the appellant, by his direction, posed the wrong question. He directed attention to the capacity of each accused to form the requisite intent. He should, rather, have directed attention to whether the accused did, in each case, form that intent. 
      
       
     143 The summing up, on this issue, was introduced by these words: (S/U 8) 
      
       
        
         
         ""There is material, in the evidence of the complainant and in the records of interview of the accused, that apart from Ricky Dungay, these men were somewhat intoxicated. Either from alcohol or a combination of alcohol and marijuana. Normally that has no bearing on the criminal responsibility of an individual for his acts. I mean you cannot say, in cases such as this, 'I was drunk and I didn't know what I was doing.' That might be a reasonable explanation if you were staggering down the street drunk and fell through a shopkeepers plate glass window, but what is alleged here, in regard to each accused, are deliberate acts of sexual assault. If a man tries to sexually molest a woman he cannot say, 'I didn't know what I was doing because I was drunk', that is no defence."" 
         
        
       
     144 His Honour then said this: (S/U 8/9) 
      
       
        
         
         ""But in this case there is room for the following argument. This was a group of men coming back from the New Year's celebrations, many of them were heavily affected by alcohol and or drugs. The point is, did the effect of those substances so affect the individual accused that he was unable to determine rationally and sensibly, whether (the complainant) was or was not consenting to have sexual intercourse with him. I am bound to give you this direction, members of the jury, because of the circumstances of this case."" 
         
        
       
     145 There followed the words about which complaint is made: (S/U 9) 
      
       
        
         
         ""If the given accused was so intoxicated that he could not put his mind to the question, 'Is she consenting', then you might think he was not reckless as to her consent, as I defined it earlier, and that element would not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt."" 
         
        
       
     146 His Honour then made a comment, which is said to be unjustified: (S/U 9) 
      
       
        
         
         ""Of course you would also bear in mind, that if a man was so intoxicated by alcohol or drugs, that he was in that condition, then he probably would not be able to perform sexually in any way at all, at least to his own satisfaction, but that is a matter for you."" 
         
        
       
     147 His Honour concluded his directions on the elements, including the mental element, with the following summary of the issues which the jury should address: (S/U 9) 
      
       
        
         
         ""Well if you have a reasonable doubt as to any of the first three matters, members of the jury, that is, that there was, in regard to each accused, an act of sexual intercourse, secondly that (the complainant) did not consent and thirdly that the accused knew she did not consent. If you have a reasonable doubt about any one of those three elements then you would find the accused not guilty of that charge."" 
         
        
       
     148 The appellant drew attention to The Queen v O'Connor (1979 -1980) 146 CLR 64 (and especially Barwick CJ at 87/88), as well as R v Coleman (1990) 47 A Crim R 306. In the latter case, Hunt J (with whom Finlay and Allen JJ agreed) dealt with precisely the same issue. His Honour summarised the appellant's argument in these words: (at 317) 
      
       
        
         
         ""The correct question in relation to each of the issues of voluntariness, basic intent, intention to injure, recklessness and specific intent, the appellant argues, is not one of ability or capacity to form the relevant state of mind; rather it is a question of whether the Crown has established that the appellant did in fact form the relevant state of mind."" 
         
        
       
     149 His Honour then said this: (at 323) 
      
       
        
         
         ""There can be no doubt therefore that the correct question for the jury upon the issue of intoxication is whether the Crown has established that the accused had in fact formed the state of mind which is relevant to the offence charged. If an issue of intoxication is sufficiently raised in the evidence, the Crown must remove any reasonable doubt as to that question which may have been raised by that evidence, whether or not the intoxication was self-induced and whether or not it has incapacitated the accused from forming the relevant state of mind. Those directions are applicable whether the relevant state of mind be the voluntary nature of the act done, basic intent, malice (intention to injure or recklessness) or specific intent."" 
         
        
       
     150 I accept that the issue was not the capacity of the accused to form the intent, but rather whether the accused did form that intent. I therefore accept that the appellant has established error.  
      
       
     151 No complaint was made at the trial concerning the direction now impugned. Rule 4 therefore applies. Leave is required. Can it be said, in the context of the trial, that the error may have led to a miscarriage of justice? 
      
       
     152 Mr Griffen did not give evidence. He was, however, interviewed by the police on 4 January 1999, that is, a matter of days after the incident. At first he denied knowledge of any of the events described by the complainant, asserting that he was asleep. The police then asked for a blood sample. Mr Griffen thereafter said that he wished to tell the truth. He described in detail what had happened that day. His account, in its detail and the sequence he described, was similar to that given by the complainant, except that he asserted that she had consented. 
      
       
     153 In the course of the summing up, having given the general directions to which I have referred (in respect of which there was error), his Honour then dealt with each accused individually. In respect of Mr Griffen, his Honour dealt with the arguments of Mr Formosa of counsel, then appearing for Mr Griffen, on the issue of intoxication, correctly posing the issue which the jury was obliged to consider. The summing up was in these terms: (S/U 50) 
      
       
        
         
         ""Mr Formosa argues further, that on this night Griffen had had a considerable amount to drink and had used marijuana and was, as he put it, full of dope. Thus his perceptions and recognition of any reluctance on the part of the complainant, if there was any, was considerably diminished. Thus counsel submitted, you could not be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Griffen knew or realised she was not consenting. Putting it another way, counsel argued that so far as Griffen was concerned the complainant was consenting and he had no reason to believe otherwise. And when you look at the objective evidence of her and him strolling along some fifty metres away from all the others and simply engaging in sexual acts, you must have a reasonable doubt that (a) she did not consent, and (b) he knew she was not consenting. Well members of the jury, that is a matter for you to determine in light of all the evidence admissible against Mr Griffen and the directions I have given to you."" 
         
        
       
     154 I do not accept, in these circumstances, that the error by his Honour may have led to a miscarriage of justice. I would refuse leave under Rule 4. 
      
       
        
       Order 
        
       
     155 I agree with the order proposed by Heydon JA that the appeal in each case be dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 NEWMAN AJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence of imprisonment imposed by his Honour Judge O'Reilly QC in the District Court at Penrith on 11 April 2001.  
      
       
     2 Before his Honour the applicant had pleaded guilty to supplying heroin on an ongoing basis contrary to the provisions of s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
      
       
     3 That legislative provision provides for a maximum penalty of 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for twenty years or both. As I have said, the applicant pleaded guilty before his Honour which resulted in his Honour imposing a sentence of imprisonment for five years and six months to commence on 11 May 2000, the date, I should add, when the applicant was taken into custody and to expire on 10 November 2005. 
      
       
     4 His Honour imposed a non-parole period of three years and three months expiring on 1 August 2003. 
      
       
     5 S 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is a relevantly recent addition to the legislation of this State. It provides, so far as is relevant: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. A person who on three or more separate occasions during any period of thirty consecutive days supplies a prohibited drug, other than cannabis, for financial material reward is guilty of an offence”  
          
         
        
       
     and goes on to set out the maximum penalty to which I have already referred. 
      
       
     6 The objective facts of the matter may be pithily stated. The first of the three occasions adverted to in s 25A of the relevant Act was that on Wednesday, 3 May 2000, the applicant at Blackheath supplied to a man known as Bradley Curtis 1.9 grams of heroin at a cost of $120. Pausing there, heroin is a prohibitive drug in terms of the statute. Bradley was soon afterwards apprehended by police. Later he telephoned the applicant to report this event to him, a call which was monitored by police. 
      
       
     7 The second of the occasions, which was on 11 May 2000, is when the applicant supplied a man named David McCann with .11 grams of heroin at Katoomba charging him $50 for the drug. 
      
       
     8 The third occasion occurred on the same day, namely 11 May, at 3.20pm when the applicant sold a lady called Eschelle Seaton, again at Katoomba, .06 grams of heroin and charged her $50. 
      
       
     9 As part of his Honour's objective findings, which were entirely supported by the documentation put before him, he found that at 6.28pm on the same day, that is 11 May, the police executed a search warrant at the applicant's premises at Blackheath. There they found in excess of $1,000 in cash in three bundles. Furthermore they found .15 grams of heroin and some cannabis leaf and equipment usually associated with drug dealing. Prior to the applicant's presentation on 11 May 2000 the applicant had been subject to telephone surveillance in April of 2000 to that date. Of 887 calls intercepted in that relatively short period of time 777 were related to drug dealing, an average of 35 calls per day. Albeit, as his Honour found, certain of those calls, that is the 777 calls, would have been repetitive for customers either seeking more information or re-contacting the applicant for those reasons. 
      
       
     10 Thus, not only were the elements of the crime created by s 25A well and truly made out but there was cogent evidence before his Honour that the applicant was involved in drug dealing to some considerable extent. I should add that his Honour generously accepted the applicant's statement that his operation was not, to use the applicant's own words, a real large one. 
      
       
     11 Subjectively the matters taken into account by his Honour included the applicant's prior criminal record. Sadly that record was not one which would encourage the Court to deal with the applicant leniently. It did include convictions for drug dealing in the past which had resulted in the applicant serving custodial sentences. 
      
       
     12 His Honour had before him other material including a psychological assessment of the applicant by Miss Anita Duffy. His Honour took into account Miss Duffy's report and observed that the report was of use in that it provided an indication of the applicant's background. The applicant before this Court, as one of his written arguments states, submitted that the psychological report used had been prepared for a different matter. Be that as it was, the psychological report was before his Honour. His Honour took it fully into account and, looking at the language his Honour used, took it into account in a manner which was favourable to the applicant. 
      
       
     13 His Honour also did refer to the problems which the applicant had incurred in his dealings with DOCS in relation to his son. Again the applicant adverted to that matter in the passage I have already read from his written submissions. 
      
       
     14 The applicant also submitted that he did not think his Honour took into consideration how many drugs he was using at the time. His Honour, looking at the evidence, concluded that what the applicant was doing was buying about three and a half grams per day and selling about two grams per day, therefore using for himself about one and a half grams. My only observation is that his Honour did take into account the applicant's own use of drugs. 
      
       
     15 The question of the application of s 25A in sentencing matters has, because of its recent appearance in the statute books of New South Wales, received only limited attention from this Court. The first matter was a judgment of this Court on 14 April 2000 in R v Smiroldo 112 A Crim R 47 where Hulme J delivered the main judgment with which the other members of the Court concurred. His Honour there observed at page 4 of his judgment, paragraph 15: 
      
       
        
         
         “The persons at whom s 25A is directed are those who appear to be indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs. It must, it seems to me, be relevant to consider the magnitude of such an operation. The greater the quantity of a prohibited drug may be considered by a series of a few small transactions as a few large ones ... s 25A would have been involved in the supply of far more than the particular quantities the subject of the occasions which inspire the charge.” 
         
        
       
     16 His Honour then adverted to sentencing only on the facts proved referring to Di Simone 137 CLR 383 and also observed that the sentencing judge was entitled to take other matters into account which bore on the applicant's criminality and were proved in accordance with the standards referred to in The Queen v Allbrick 93 ALR 1550. The matter also received attention of this Court in Patek's case which was decided on 10 July last year in which the matters adverted to by Hulme J in Smiroldo's case were confirmed. 
      
       
     17 In his remarks on sentence his Honour adverted to the problem involved in using criminal statistics in attempting to arrive at an appropriate sentence. It seems to me that, as yet, statistics of a relatively recent piece of legislation such as 25A referred to in the Act do not give great guidance to those involved in the sentencing process. Earlier statistics relating to crimes such as supply of drugs of the amount we are dealing with here which would not give rise to long sentences are, in my view, inappropriate. S 25A establishes a crime which is one of great seriousness as is indicated by a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment stipulated by the legislation. 
      
       
     18 In the instant case his Honour took into account all the appropriate subjective matters. He dealt with the objective facts in the appropriate way and dealt with the findings he made in light of the most serious offence which could be found whereby the operation of s 25A would come into effect. In my view, having regard to the objective features of the case and the nature of the applicant's activities as indicated not only by the matters which created the offence but by the activity which was evidenced by the telephone surveillance in the matter prior to the applicant's presentation, would cause me to believe that his Honour's sentence in fact is very much at the lower end of the scale and could well be described as very lenient. However, there is no Crown appeal, a matter which does not surprise me and I make no criticism of the Crown in that regard but, having said that, it is apparent that, in my view, no error has been demonstrated on the part of his Honour. 
      
       
     19 Because of the seriousness of the matter to the applicant and the fact that in terms of the criminal law s 25A creates an offence of recent origin, I would grant the applicant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     20 CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     21 NEWMAN AJ: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

       Introduction 
        
       
     2 On 14 December 2000 the appellant, Ferney Soto-Sanchez, was found guilty by a jury of a charge under s 233B of the Customs Act 1901. The indictment maintained that on 4 November 1999 the appellant did, without reasonable excuse, have in his possession prohibited imports which had been imported into Australia, to wit a quantity of cocaine being not less than a commercial quantity. On 23 March 2001 the appellant was sentenced by Acting Judge Woods to imprisonment for a term of 24 years, to date from 4 November 1999, with a non-parole period of 18 years fixed. 
      
       
     3 The appellant appeals against the conviction and also seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
      
       
        
       The Crown case 
        
       
     4 The following is an edited summary of the Crown case taken from its written submission: 
      
       
        
         
         On 6 February 1999 the appellant arrived in Sydney from Columbia. He subsequently obtained rental accommodation in Pyrmont and worked as a labourer. 
          
         On 26 September 1999 two Spanish nationals, Salvador Salgado-Silva and Juan Cordero-Vidal travelled from Spain to Miami, USA. On 8 October 1999 they travelled from Miami to Venezuela. Three weeks later they travelled to Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, and then to Amsterdam, Holland. … On 3 November 1999 they arrived in Sydney airport on a flight from Amsterdam. 
         
        
        
         
         Silva’s accompanying luggage included a metal suitcase which was later found to contain 12.862 kilograms of 63% pure cocaine powder (totalling 8.105 kilograms of pure cocaine) concealed in two specially constructed video camera battery belts. 
         
        
        
         
         After a preliminary examination of the battery belts revealed the presence of cocaine, members of the Australian Federal Police … were called and Salgado-Silva and Cordero-Vidal were arrested … They both agreed to assist police in a “controlled delivery” of the drugs and they were taken to room number 302 in the Furama Hotel at Darling Harbour (sic Surry Hills) the next day. The AFP set up in room 301 to monitor events, including by way of video and audio recording. The battery packs, containing all the cocaine less some small samples … were taken along with the other items of luggage to the room. 
         
        
        
         
         At about 12.26pm Salgado-Silva made an outgoing telephone call to “Octavio Quintero” in Spain. He gave Quintero the hotel telephone number and room number. Quintero said that he would contact someone and that person would telephone Salgado-Silva soon. 
         
        
        
         
         A short time later an incoming call was received in room 302. Salgado-Silva answered. The caller asked where Salgado-Silva was located and he told him “Furama Central Hotel … 28 Albion Street … Surry Hills”. The caller said that a person would “soon” attend on Salgado-Silva and that he should take a walk with that person. Salgado-Silva said he preferred not to leave the Hotel room. 
         
        
        
         
         At about 2.57pm the appellant knocked on the door of room 302 and Salgado-Silva was seen to leave the room with him. They went for a walk along Albion Street and appeared to converse. Salgado-Silva returned to room 302 a short time later. 
         
        
        
         
         At about 4.00pm Salgado-Silva telephoned Quintero again and told him that he was concerned about things the appellant had said to him. Quintero indicated “they” were concerned that he had not telephoned Quintero the day before and told him to “follow their instructions”. 
         
        
        
         
         About 4.30pm the appellant returned to room 302 and went inside. Salgado-Silva opened the silver metal bag, which contained the two battery straps, and he and the appellant appeared to have a conversation. Salgado-Silva then closed the silver suitcase and a short time later the appellant left the room. 
         
        
        
         
         At about 8.19pm the appellant again entered room 302, carrying an empty black back pack. The appellant … assisted Salgado-Silva as he removed the two battery straps from the metal suitcase and placed them into a light coloured bag. They were unable to close the bag and Salgado-Silva then put it into the silver suitcase. Cordero-Vidal then emptied the contents of the light coloured bag into the silver suitcase while Salgado-Silva obtained a dark coloured suitcase, tipped the contents of that bag on to the bed and then removed the battery packs from the silver suitcase and put them in the dark suitcase. After Salgado-Silva had fastened the bag the appellant lifted it up. 
         
        
        
         
         At about 8.23pm Salgado-Silva and the appellant left room 302. The appellant carried the black suitcase containing the battery packs. The black back pack he brought to the room was left there. The appellant was arrested in the vicinity of an elevator near room 302 with the black suitcase in his hand. When asked by police what he was doing he replied “I don’t know anything”. When asked who owned the bag he again replied “I don’t know anything”. In his possession at the time of his arrest was an amount of cash totalling $930 plus a piece of paper with the handwriting “28 Albion Str, Surry Hills, Hotel Furama Central”.  
         
        
       
     5 The appellant made two records of interview with police, the first was after his arrest and the second on 18 August 2000 made at his request. In the second interview the appellant indicated that some of what he had said in the first interview was false. 
      
       
        
       The Defence case 
        
       
     6 The appellant gave evidence which may be summarised as follows. He said he had gone to the hotel on the first occasion and asked Salgado-Silva if he wanted to go sightseeing or to have a coffee. Notwithstanding Salgado-Silva’s refusal on the ground he was too tired the appellant ‘insisted’ and they then went out for a walk. They talked about unimportant things such as Salgado-Silva’s trip to Australia. On leaving Salgado-Silva the appellant returned to his flat and found his cousin Soto-Gallo there. He asked the appellant to return to the hotel to ask the men to come to the flat so they would not have to spend the whole day in the hotel. That offer, on his return to the hotel at about 4.30pm, was declined but whilst there Salgado-Silva showed him some ‘blue packets’ which he was offering him. The appellant told Salgado-Silva he was confusing him with someone else and he was just there to take him to the flat. 
      
       
        
       The appellant said he returned that evening carrying a back pack and the money because he proposed to do some shopping later that evening. Salgado-Silva asked if he could borrow his back pack because ‘he had to take some things’ and asked if he would assist him with taking a camera. The things did not fit into his back pack and Salgado-Silva then put the things into a suitcase and carried it from the room, whilst the appellant carried a video camera.  
        
        
       The Grounds of Appeal 
        
       
     7 There are four grounds of appeal against conviction. They are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The trial miscarried because his Honour erred when directing the jury about the onus and standard of proof. 
         
        
        
         
         2. His Honour failed to direct the jury about the manner in which they should deal with the evidence of the appellant’s good character. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The trial miscarried because the appellant was cross examined without leave about sharing premises with prostitutes and about not having paid tax. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The trial miscarried because of offensive questions put in cross examination suggesting that the appellant was a “compulsive liar” and a “liar”.  
         
        
        
       Ground 1 - Direction on onus and standard of proof 
        
       
     8 His Honour gave quite a short Summing-Up to the jury. In some trials this may be a virtue. However, its brevity in this trial may have contributed to error. Early in the Summing-Up, his Honour gave the jury perfectly usual and conventional directions on the onus of proof and standard of proof. No complaint is made about them, nor could it. 
      
       
     9 In dealing with the element in the offence of ‘possession’ his Honour touched on the need for knowledge by the accused. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         The question is, therefore, was the accused carrying the bag at that relevant time and at the time did he know that the bag contained, or was likely to contain the prohibited drugs. Once you are satisfied that the accused did carry the bag from the room, did he do so knowing that the bag contained a significant amount of prohibited drugs, or was aware that there was a significant or real chance that it did. And the Crown has the onus of satisfying you that he knew or was aware.  
         
        
       
     10 A little later his Honour turned to the case for the accused. He directed the jury as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         The accused has presented an explanation. Now you must consider whether his innocent explanation that he was asked by someone to meet some strangers and take them somewhere around Sydney is a reasonable explanation. Of course you would have noted that the arrangement for him to get them had to have only happened after the injury (sic). How he was set up that morning. It is noted that in an earlier statement to police he said he had been asked the day before to meet them at the Furama Hotel, but this was before the Furama Hotel became the venue, and before they had arrived in the country. But in his later statement and in his sworn evidence he has presented the explanation that he was merely helping two strangers to meet some other people. With respect to the accused’s explanation, you only have to consider whether it is a reasonable explanation in the circumstances. The accused does now admit that at time of his arrest in the first interview he did lie about some things, mainly how and why he had gone to the hotel. You must weigh all these things up. You have seen him in the witness box and you have the two records of interview of the police.  
         
        
       
     11 His Honour then immediately turned to the issue of the appellant’s character and said to the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         This does raise a matter of character. It is character first of accused has been raised in the case. He has stated that he is a person of good character. The Crown in some of its questions has suggested otherwise. This is a difficult matter to consider but you as members of the community who see persons acting in different ways around you in ordinary life can assess this. There is no evidence to show that the accused has been a person of bad character. Yes he agrees he told lies to the police at first. This must all be balanced as to credibility you must assess that from what he said in the witness box. But even if you find he is not a person of the best of character from some things he has admitted that still does not make him guilty of this offence.  
         
        
       
     12 It is this direction which is the subject of ground 2 of the appeal. 
      
       
     13 The trial judge then gave the following direction to the jury, which counsel for the appellant, Mr Boulten, describes as containing a fundamental and dramatic error. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         We must be very wary of the risk of the entrapment of an innocent man. So is there a chance that the police accidentally got the wrong person. So could it be that he did come innocently to assist to (sic) two apparent strangers who appeared to come into the country the previous night with a large quantity of prohibited drugs. At the end of all your analysis of the evidence, is the only reasonable or credible explanation the guilt of the accused, namely he had the drugs when he walked out of the room and he knew he had them. Or could there be another explanation. Is there a reasonable chance on the balance of probabilities that what the accused said in his record of interview that he was merely coming to the Furama Hotel to take the people there out to see the town or to meet other people. Because if so then you must have a reasonable doubt and the accused must be acquitted.  
         
        
       
     14 The Summing-Up concluded shortly thereafter. It appears that no complaint was made by either counsel to his Honour about any aspect of the Summing-Up. The appeal books do not contain a transcript of what transpired immediately after the jury retired. However, appellant’s counsel accepts that no objection was taken to any portion of the Summing-Up, nor were any additional directions sought.  
      
       
     15 The Crown concedes that if the appellant is successful on this ground, it cannot raise a Rule 4 argument against him. 
      
       
     16 It should be recorded that both the Crown and the accused were represented by different counsel at the trial than on the appeal. 
      
       
     17 It seems to me that what his Honour said, quoted above in para 13, ran a real risk of reversing the onus of proof. His Honour told the jury that they might form a reasonable doubt if ‘there is a reasonable chance on the balance of probabilities that what the accused said in his record of interview’ (my emphasis), was true. This would mean that the jury might understand that they could find the appellant guilty on the basis that they were not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that his version of events was true. 
      
       
     18 But this is not the law. A reasonable doubt can be left even where the accused gives no explanation for his conduct. A jury may reject, in whole or part, evidence led by the defence and still be left with a reasonable doubt. A jury may be left with a reasonable doubt even where an accused does not give an explanation for his conduct. 
      
       
     19 It is the submission of counsel for the appellant that the direction was fundamentally flawed and constituted a departure from the essential requirements of a fair trial. It is contended that the error went to the root of the trial so that it can be said that the appellant did not have a proper trial, R v Wilde (1998) 164 CLR 365 and Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514. 
      
       
     20 The Crown’s response to this powerful submission is that the phrase ‘balance of probabilities’ was not used by his Honour in any technical sense but rather in the context of directing the jury to consider the explanation proffered by the appellant, and in the context of reminding the jury that the onus was on the Crown to prove the offence beyond reasonable doubt. 
      
       
     21 I do not accept this submission. The defence of the accused depended on whether the jury believed him or not. But what his Honour said ran a real risk that the jury would reverse the onus of proof. His Honour did not speak in terms of ‘reasonable possibility’ with regard to the version of the appellant.22 Not only was the direction liable to confuse and mislead the jury as to the proper onus and standard of proof, it had the effect of restricting the jury in considering reasonable doubt in relation to the prosecution evidence. It may also be observed that his Honour’s direction, the subject of the criticism, was virtually the last advice he gave to the jury before they retired. 
      
       
     23 In my view, his Honour committed a fundamental error when he so directed the jury. The direction which he gave went to the very root of the trial. It follows that there was a miscarriage of justice which entitles the appellant to have the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2: Failure to direct on character 
        
       
     24 Although the appeal is decided favourably to the appellant on Ground 1, it is necessary to briefly address the remaining grounds of appeal. This is particularly so bearing in mind what was said by the High Court in The Queen v Chai [2002] HCA12 on 14 March 2002, see para [3]. 
      
       
     25 It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that his Honour failed to direct the jury on the manner in which they should deal with the evidence of the appellant’s good character. 
      
       
     26 In the Summing-Up the trial judge referred to the fact that the appellant had admitted that he told lies to the police in his first interview. His Honour then said: 
      
       
        
         
         This does raise a matter of character. It is character first of accused has been raised in the case. He has stated that he is a person of good character. The Crown in some of its questions has suggested otherwise. This is a difficult matter to consider but you as members of the community who see persons acting in different ways around you in ordinary life can assess this. There is no evidence to show that the accused has been a person of bad character. Yes he agrees he told lies to the police at first. This must all be balanced as to credibility you must assess that from what he said in the witness box. But even if you find he is not a person of the best of character from some things he has admitted that still does not make him guilty of this offence. [AB 353 .4 to .8] 
         
        
       
     27 Counsel for the appellant submits that the fact that the appellant had no prior criminal convictions had probative value in two respects. It was relevant to the appellant’s credibility when he gave evidence. It was also a factor affecting the likelihood of the appellant having committed the offence. He argues that the jury should have been directed that the appellant’s evidence of good character needed to be considered in relation to the appellant’s propensity to commit the offence and to his credibility. His Honour’s direction failed to direct on either basis. 
      
       
     28 The submission has validity. His Honour did not give the required direction on the appellant’s character. The Crown responds by saying that it was not sought. That is so, but it seems to me that since the appellant had called evidence of good character, the trial judge should have given the necessary direction on both limbs, or at least have raised the matter with counsel before deciding what to say to the jury on character. 
      
       
     29 The failure to give the direction was important because it could have had some affect on the jury. Again, the appellant succeeds on this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3: Cross-examination of accused without leave 
        
       
     30 The appellant was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor about his sleeping arrangements with prostitutes and about not having paid income tax. The Crown accepts that leave was required to be sought to so question the appellant but that leave was not so sought (s 112 Evidence Act). 
      
       
     31 The cross-examination of the appellant about his sleeping arrangements in the flat where he lived was clearly an endeavour to determine if the appellant slept in the same bed as a prostitute. The appellant himself objected to answering a question relating to the employment or occupation of his flat-mates, although his counsel did not object. The judge made no ruling and the appellant was required to answer the series of questions. 
      
       
     32 The appellant was then asked, ‘Have you ever paid tax’? The question was objected to by the appellant’s counsel but allowed by his Honour. The appellant answered ‘No’. 
      
       
     33 It was irrelevant whether the appellant did not pay tax or lived with prostitutes. The evidence was prejudicial to the appellant. If leave had been sought to so cross-examine, it could have been rejected under s 137 of the Evidence Act as its probative value was clearly outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the appellant. If leave had been sought to cross-examine, his Honour would have had to consider the discretion in s 192(2) of the Evidence Act, in particular sub sections (b), (c) and (d). See R v Stanoevski (2001) 202 CLR 115. 
      
       
     34 Counsel for the respondent submits that the appellant suffered no great prejudice by reason of what was asked of him without leave. Accordingly, it is submitted that there was no miscarriage of justice. However, the appellant’s credibility was central to the jury’s deliberations. In combination with ground 2, relating to his Honour’s failure to properly direct the jury on the character of the accused, it raises a prejudice in the appellant which may amount to a miscarriage of justice. It should be recalled that in his Honour’s direction on character the judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         He [the appellant] has stated that he is a person of good character.  
         The Crown in some of its questions has suggested otherwise.  
         [My emphasis added] 
         
        
        
       Ground 4: Offensive cross-examination of accused 
        
       
     35 In his cross-examination of the accused the Crown Prosecutor repeatedly attacked him as a ‘liar’. Sometimes this was with specification but, on occasions, was not. An example of the latter is the question ‘You are a liar aren’t you? Another of the prosecutor’s questions was: 
      
       
        
         
         You see, you are a compulsive liar, aren’t you, Mr Sanchez?  
         
        
       
     36 It is the submission on behalf of the appellant that the repeated questions were offensive and should have been disallowed pursuant to s 41 of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
     37 While not endorsing the style and repetition of questioning of the accused by the prosecutor, two matters may be noted. First, because the appellant had admitted that he had told the police untruths in his first interview, the prosecutor was entitled to cross-examine the appellant on his interviews with a view to seek to establish that his answers in the interviews were lies or that particular answers in his evidence were lies. Secondly, no objection was made by counsel for the appellant to any of the questions suggesting that the accused was a liar. 
      
       
     38 It seems to me that in considering this ground on its own that rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be applied and leave to argue this ground should be refused. 
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     39 The appeal should be allowed and the conviction of the appellant quashed and a new trial ordered. It is, accordingly, unnecessary to consider the appeal against sentence. 
      
       
     40 SULLY J: I agree with Stein JA. 
      
       
     41 SMART AJ: The facts and circumstances are set out in the judgment of Stein JA. There were two issues in the trial, namely, whether the appellant carried the suitcase and thus had possession of the drugs and whether he knew (or believed) that he was carrying drugs. I agree with what Stein JA has written as to grounds 1, 2 and 3.  
      
       
     42 As to ground 4, I regard the particular cross-examination in which counsel for the Crown engaged as impermissible. The fifth question was ""You are a liar, aren't you?"" This was more an assertion than a question. That 'question' was general and not related to any subject matter. The refrain in some of the cross-examination was that just as the appellant had lied to the police (which the appellant admitted) he was lying to the court. There was also the question (or assertion) ""You see, you are a compulsive liar, aren't you, Mr Sanchez?"" There were questions (or assertions) such as ""I suggest you are lying again Mr Sanchez."" Most of this occurred early in the cross-examination and had the effect of setting the stage. It went too far. Thereafter there was a detailed cross-examination as to the various events which had occurred. The cross-examination concluded with this assertion, ""And I suggest you are lying to ... the jury as you have lied in your records of interview."" That was an unfair question. Such a comparison is inapt. 
      
       
     43 The appellant gave his evidence through an interpreter and at some times appeared to experience some difficulty. The effect of some of the cross-examination was to stir up illicit prejudice. 
      
       
     44 Counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial did not object to the impermissible questions. The Crown was entitled to cross-examine the appellant as to the lies he had told the police. Counsel for the appellant made no application to the trial judge It is important that these matters be dealt with at the trial. However once questions of the kind mentioned are asked some prejudice is created even though it is the answers which are important at law.45 I regard impermissible Crown cross-examination as a serious matter with its capacity to create illicit prejudice against an accused. I would reject the r.4 point and also allow the appeal on ground 4. 
      
       
        
       The Crown case was a strong one and it is a matter of regret that there has to be a new trial but the proviso cannot be applied because of the fundamental departures from the requirements of a fair trial according to law. I agree with the orders proposed by Stein JA.

    IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONO’KEEFE J.10 May 200212107/00 - HAROLD NORMAN ANSON v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 
     
      
    JUDGMENT 
     
      
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1    Harold Norman Anson (the plaintiff) stands charged with 87 offences of passing valueless cheques between 2 October 1998 and 3 August 1999 in contravention of s 178B of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Crimes Act) as well as with a number of other offences which are not material to the present matter.  
     
      
    2    The charges against the plaintiff were laid over a period commencing on 1 February 2000 and extending until 23 May 2000. On 28 February 2000 pleas of guilty were entered to seven charges under s 178B that had been laid on 1 February 2000 on the basis that the matters would be dealt with summarily. On 27 March 2000, pleas of guilty were entered to a further 42 charges under that section and the prosecution indicated that it did not propose to proceed on two offences which were apparently duplications that had been laid in error. A further 39 charges were laid on 23 May 2000 and on that date all matters were adjourned to 6 June 2000.  
     
      
    3    On 6 June 2000 the prosecution stated that it elected to have the charges dealt with on indictment. Consequently on the application of the plaintiff leave was given to the plaintiff to withdraw the pleas of guilty which had been entered. All matters were then adjourned to 13 June 2000 on which date orders were made for the service of the brief by 26 June 2000 and all matters were further adjourned to 26 June 2000 to enable the representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions to appear. The brief was duly served on 26 June 2000 and the matters were adjourned yet again until 10 July 2000. On that date the Director of Public Prosecutions sought to withdraw the election to have the charges under s 178B of the Crimes Act dealt with on indictment. This was resisted by the legal representative of the plaintiff who argued that the court had no jurisdiction to deal with the offences under s 178B of the Crimes Act, as such offences were summary and any information in respect of them would have to have been laid within six months of the date of the alleged offence as required by s 56 of the Justices Act 1902. This submission related to all the offences with which the plaintiff had been charged. 4    On 14 July 2000 the representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions accepted that all charges under s 178B of the Crimes Act had been laid at a time which was beyond the six month period provided for in s 56 of the Justices Act.  
     
      
    5    Before the Magistrate the nub of the argument on behalf of the plaintiff was that if the offences charged were not indictable they must be summary and the time limitation of six months provided for in s 56 of the Justices Act applied to them. It was further argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the offences charged under s 178B of the Crimes Act could only be dealt with summarily because of the provisions of s 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the Criminal Procedure Act).  
     
      
    6    The Magistrate reserved her decision. It was delivered on 14 July 2000 and in the course of her judgment she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prosecutions view is that the matter commenced as an indictable charge and as it did, it does not change its nature and s 56 does not apply. 
        
       
       
       … 
       
       
        
        In my opinion paragraph 8  
        (ie s 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act)  
        clearly distinguishes between summary offences and indictable offences that are dealt with summary. I think the question is that is required to be dealt with summary or may be dealt with summary.  
        (explanatory parenthesis added) 
        
       
       
        
        I am in agreement with the prosecution case that it starts off as an indictable offence and does not change character and therefore it remains an indictable offence and the provisions of s 56 don’t apply.” 
        
       
      
    7    The decision of the Magistrate had two consequences. First, that the charges were not to be dealt with summarily, unless either the prosecutor or the plaintiff agreed to them being so dealt with; second, that there was no possible argument as to the availability of a defence under s 56 since that section applied only to summary offences. 
     
      
    8    The plaintiff has sought leave to appeal from the decision of the Magistrate referred to in paragraphs six and seven above. The summons filed by the plaintiff seeks: 
     
      
      1. An order granting leave to appeal. 
       
      2. An order quashing the order of (the Magistrate) made on 14 July 2000 declaring that offences under s178B of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
       are indictable offences. 
       
      3. An order that the offences allegedly committed by the plaintiff under s 178B of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
       are wholly summary offences. 
      
    4. An order that the matters be remitted to the learned Magistrate to hear and determine in accordance with the orders of this Honourable Court.  
     
      
    9    As explained in the Statement of Grounds, the relief sought raises two distinct matters for decision: The first is procedural; the second, substantive.  
     
      
    10    The first or procedural matter for decision involves two questions: 
     
      
       
      (i) Is the determination of the Magistrate an interlocutory order within the meaning of s 104(4) of the  
      Justices Act 1902 
       (the Justices Act)? 
       
       
      (ii) If it is, should leave to appeal be granted? In this regard the Crown does not oppose the granting of leave to appeal should the first question be determined in favour of the plaintiff. 
       
      
    11    The second or substantive matter for decision is whether an offence under s 178B of the Crimes Act is an indictable or wholly summary offence. 
     
      
    12    This depends on the effect of the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which came into force on 1 January 2000. 
     
      
       
       
      Section 104(4) of the  
      Justices Act, 1902 
       
      
    13    Section 104 of the Justices Act 1902 regulates the circumstances in which an appeal can be taken from a magistrate. Section 104(4) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A defendant or an informant may appeal under this Division to the Supreme Court against any interlocutory order that is made by a Magistrate in summary proceedings on a ground that involves a question of law alone, but only with the leave of the Supreme Court.” 
        
       
      
    14    For the determination of the Magistrate to fall within appeal provisions of s 104(4) of the Justices Act it must be able to be characterised as an interlocutory order and the proceedings must be summary. What is and is not an interlocutory order within the meaning of that subsection is far from clear. As was said by Sheller JA in Regina v Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197: 
     
      
       
        
        “The cases have set no bright line for differentiating between what are truly orders in the sense described in Steffan and Stuart, and what are rulings in the sense described in Powch, Groves and Rogerson” 
        (supra at 202) 
        
       
      
    15    This statement by Sheller JA echoes what was said by Gibbs J in Licul v Corney (1976) 50 ALJR 439 at 443-444 and is reminiscent of what was said by Lord Denning MR in Salter Rex & Co v Gosh (1971) 2 QB 597, namely that the question: 
     
      
       
        
        “…is so uncertain that the only thing for practitioners to do is to look up the practice books and see what has been decided on the point.” 
        (supra at 601) 
        
       
       
        
          
        
       
      
    16    However, whether the decision made by the Magistrate in the present case falls within the description “interlocutory order” is not the subject of express authority, so the advice tendered by Lord Denning MR is not of assistance. 
     
      
    17    In aid of his submission that the decision made by the Magistrate fell within the ambit of s 104(4) of the Justices Act, counsel for the plaintiff relied on s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (the Criminal Appeal Act) as a statutory provision in pari materia. This section relevantly provides that the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal “against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which (the) section applies” (s 5F(2)). Section 5F(3) provides that any party other than the Attorney General or Director of Public Prosecutions in proceedings to which the section applies: 
     
      
       
        
        “…may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any interlocutory judgment or order made in the proceedings: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal; or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) if the judge, justice or magistrate of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    18    In Regina v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136, it was held that a refusal to direct the recall of a Crown witness for further cross-examination was not an interlocutory judgment or order. Yeldham J, with whom Carruthers and Wood JJ agreed, said that such a refusal:  
     
      
       
        
        “Is no more than … a ruling on a procedural matter, and is not in any sense an interlocutory judgment or order.” (supra at 138) 
         
        
       
      
    19    The decision in Regina v Powch (supra) was followed in Regina v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213, in which it was held that advance rulings on the admissibility of evidence, the sufficiency of evidence and the adequacy of the counts charged were not interlocutory judgments or orders within the ambit of s 5F. Lee CJ at CL said that:  
     
      
       
        
        “… there are no procedures at all established by rule or otherwise which can give rise to such judgments in criminal matters. In the Supreme Court all matters pertaining to the trial are, as a matter of long-established practice, left to be dealt with by the judge at the trial…”(supra at 216) 
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “If matters involving the trial were dealt with before trial by a judge and a decision given, that was for convenience only, and the judge at the trial, whether the same judge or another, could reverse that decision.” (supra at 239) 
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “In my opinion s 5F has the effect that the ‘interlocutory judgment or order’ referred to is a judgment or order of a judge or magistrate made in ‘proceedings for the prosecution of offenders on indictment’ which, before the insertion of s 5F could be taken (directly or indirectly) to the Court of Appeal. For present purposes it is sufficient to say that s 5F thus does not include rulings by a judge of the Supreme Court given in advance of matters affecting the trial.” (supra at 230) 
         
        
       
      
    20    Whilst the ultimate decision arrived at in Regina v Edelsten (supra) accords with later decisions of the court, the restrictive approach to the construction of s 5F which is inherent in the statements of the law by Lee CJ at CL does not, in my opinion, accord with such decisions. 
     
      
    21    Regina v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 affirmed that a ruling on evidence made in advance of a trial pursuant to the procedure prescribed by District Court Rules Pt 55 rules 10 and 11, was not an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, and hence no appeal lay from such a ruling. The Court pointed out that the ruling could be altered during the course of the trial and that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It … cannot be entered in the records of the court as a judgment; nor does it command that anything be done (or not done) in the sense of an order of the court. It remains as no more than a ruling, one which can be tested on appeal to this court after a conviction.” (supra at 639) 
        
       
      
    22    Although the result in Regina v Powch (supra) was accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Steffan (supra), the distinction that had been drawn in that case between a ruling on a procedural matter and a judgment or order was not accepted (at 636). The Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “(t)he distinction …between a ruling on a procedural matter and a judgment or order would not always be an accurate one, as some procedural matters (such as an application for a change of venue or for a separate trial) would usually produce an interlocutory order, whereas others … clearly would not…”  
        (supra at 636) 
        
       
      
    23    Furthermore, although the criteria referred to in paragraph 21 (above) are clearly appropriate matters at which to look when considering whether to characterise a decision as an interlocutory judgment or order, the fact that such decision cannot on its making be entered in the records of the court as a judgment or order is not of itself sufficient to prevent the decision in question from falling within the concept of interlocutory judgment or order as that phrase is used in various of the subsections of s 5. This in my opinion is clear from the result in Regina v Bozatsis (1997) A Crim R 296, to which reference is made below. 
     
      
    24    In Regina v Groves (NSWCCA 2 April 1990, unreported) leave to appeal against a refusal to stay a prosecution was refused where the application for leave was based on what was said to have been the obligation of the trial Judge to reject identification evidence because it was so weak. Clarke JA said that the court should be slow to permit parties to pursue applications where the matters the subject of the application are more properly the subject of decisions at the trial which are amenable to appeal after conviction.25    In Barton v Walker (1979) 2NSWLR 740, Samuels JA, with whom Reynolds and Glass JJA agreed, said that in declining to accede to an application to disqualify himself: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a judge who simply continues to sit does not thereby make a ‘decree’. 
        
       
       
        
        Nor does he make an order, I would think, if he announces that he will sit or gives reasons for deciding to do so.” (supra at 751) 
        
       
      
    26    To a like effect is Rajski v Wood (1989) 18 NSWLR 512.  
     
      
    27    Regina v Rogerson (1990) 45 A Crim R 253, was concerned with a refusal by a trial judge to disqualify himself on the ground of apprehended bias. The court held that such a refusal was not a judgment or order in respect of which an appeal would lie under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. In reaching this conclusion, Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of course, such a refusal might constitute a ground of appeal against the ultimate decision in the case in the course of which such an application was made, but …a refusal by a judge to accede to a submission that he disqualify himself is not itself a judgment or order of the court. I am respectfully of the view that the reasons that are given for that conclusion in  
        Barton v Walker 
         (1979) 2 NSWLR 740 are cogent.” (supra at 255) 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    28    However, in Regina v Rogerson (supra), Gleeson CJ, with whom Wood and Brownie JJ agreed, also said that a decision: 
     
      
       
        
        “…in relation to a refusal to vacate the hearing date stands in somewhat different position. There may well be room for considerable doubt as to whether a refusal to vacate a hearing date or grant an adjournment constitutes an interlocutory judgment or order.” (supra at 255) 
        
       
      
    29    In Regina v Waterhouse (1992) 62 A Crim R 59, consideration was given to the existence of a right of appeal against a refusal to quash an indictment or to grant a stay of the trial. Mahoney JA, with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Abadee J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am prepared to assume for present purposes that a right of appeal lies in relation to those matters, and I do so without finally deciding the matter. The terms of s 5F(3) are general, and I would require significant reasons for holding that the width of the discretion is to be read down so as to exclude in the case of an accused the right of appeal against such a matter.” (supra at 64) 
        
       
       
      
    30    In Regina v Baker (NSWCCA 5 April 1993, unreported), leave to appeal was granted against the refusal of a trial judge to grant an adjournment of a trial, in circumstances in which the effect of granting the application would have given rise to a change of venue. 
     
      
    31    Attorney General for NSW v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 was concerned with an order to a stranger to proceedings that documents be produced to the court as a consequence of the rejection of a claim of public interest immunity which lead to an order being made for the production of documents by a stranger to the proceedings. Such a decision and its consequences were held to fall within s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Smart and Studdert JJ agreed, said that an order of the kind in question: 
     
      
       
        
        “…is one which commands the stranger to do something. It may be entered in the court record and action may be taken on it in the event that it is disobeyed… the fact that it is or may also amount to a ruling upon evidence does not exclude such an order from the terms of s 5F.” 
        (at 673) 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    32    In Regina v Bozatsis (supra), the court considered whether a decision or ruling to exclude all the evidence upon which the Crown might seek to rely to prove its case, which had the consequence of effectively bringing to an end the prosecution, fell within s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. The matter for decision arose out of a notice of motion which sought orders to that effect. The Court of Criminal Appeal considered whether it had jurisdiction under s 5F. It held that it did and that the jurisdictional issue should be resolved in favour of the Crown, ie, the appeal was allowed. Gleeson CJ, with whom Meagher JA and Bruce J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is important is not [the] use of the word ‘order’, but the character and effect of the decision he [the trial judge] was making. He was not merely deciding that some particular piece of evidence was admissible or inadmissible. He was making a discretionary decision not to receive any evidence tending to prove the guilt of the respondents to the offences charged. He was, in substance, refusing to permit the Crown to seek to make a case against the appellants. Such a decision is properly characterised as a judgment or order.” (supra at 304) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    33    The significance of this decision, in my opinion, is to confirm that it is not necessary that the decision itself should be capable of being entered in the record of the court. Rather it highlights that if the effect of the decision is ultimately to give rise to an outcome which may form part of the court record, such antecedent decision is within the ambit of s 5F. 
     
      
    34    In Regina v Cheng (1999) 48 NSWLR 616 it was held that a ruling in favour of an accused person that there was no case to answer did not fall within the ambit of s 5F(2), even though the consequence of such a decision would be to lead to the jury being directed to acquit. This decision turned on the fact that it would require clear words in a statute to confer a right of appeal on the Crown in a criminal proceeding and that the words of s 5F(2) did not constitute such clear words. 
     
      
    35    Spigelman CJ, with whom Dunford and Kirby JJ agreed, having referred to the decision of Gibbs J in Licul v Corney (supra), which were affirmed by Gibbs J with the concurrence of Mason and Murphy JJ in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [No 1] (1980) 147 CLR 35 at 38, said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may be taken to be accepted that the relevant test of an interlocutory judgment is on legal effect rather than practicality.” (supra at 618) 
        
       
       
      and  
       
       
        
        “The proposition that the Crown does not have a right of appeal against acquittal is too well-established for us to interpret the words used by parliament in s 5F(2) as extending to a direction to acquit by a trial judge… it constitutes a fundamental principle of such significance that only clear and unambiguous language would lead to the conclusion that an appeal by the Crown lies against such a direction. 
        
       
       
        
        The language of s 5F(2) is not of that character. It is frequently the case that general words must be read down in order to comply with the actual or presumed intent of parliament. Absent clear language, however, parliament should be presumed not to interfere with the fundamental principle to which I have referred.” (supra at 622) 
        
       
       
      No such basis for reading down the words of s 5F(3) exists. Furthermore, what was said by Mahoney JA in  
      Regina v Waterhouse  
      (supra) suggests that s 5F(3) has a wider ambit than s 5F(2). 
       
      
    36    The significance of this decision, in my opinion, is that, although interlocutory, the finding that there was a case to answer did not have the effect of changing any rights of the person the subject of the charges and did not alter the way in which the determination of those rights was to proceed thereafter. 
     
      
    37    The decision in Regina v Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197 was concerned with an application for leave to appeal by an accused person from the rejection of a submission that there was no prima facie case. In that case it was held that a ruling on a submission that there was no case to answer was like a ruling on the admissibility of evidence and hence did not fall within s 5F(3). Sheller JA, with whom Allen and Hulme JJ agreed, highlighted the problem of differentiating between what are truly orders on the one hand and what are rulings on the other. The decision by the trial judge that there was a case to answer did not change the rights of the accused person nor give rise to the adoption of any different procedure for the determination of the guilt or otherwise of the accused. The decision that there was a case to answer simply meant that the trial proceeded to a determination by the jury as to the guilt or otherwise of the accused person. 
     
      
    38    In Regina v Saunders (1994) 72 A Crim R 347. Smart J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Studdert J agreed, examined the history in relation to interlocutory orders antecedent to s 5F and concluded that an order for a separate trial is an interlocutory order (supra at 353). A decision to sever the counts against an accused is likewise an interlocutory order.  
     
      
    39    From the foregoing it can be seen that the characterisation of what was done in the course of the proceedings does not depend upon the use of the word “judgment” or the word “order”. What has to be looked at is the character and effect of the decision.  
     
      
    40    What was done by the magistrate in the present case was interlocutory in that it did not determine finally the guilt or innocence of the plaintiff. However, the effect of the decision was at least as profound as the refusal of an adjournment, the refusal to sever counts in an indictment, or the ordering of separate trials. Furthermore, the decision had the effect of changing fundamentally the procedure for the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. Moreover, it had the effect of exposing the plaintiff to a more severe penalty than would be the case were the matters to be determined summarily. The decision was a precursor to an entry on the record that would follow necessarily from the decision that the plaintiff should be committed for trial, an outcome which would form part of the record of the Local Court, in much the same way as the decision by the trial judge in Regina v Bozatsis (supra) would necessarily lead to an acquittal being directed and then entered on the record of the Court.  
     
      
    41    It also had the effect of rejecting any claim by the plaintiff to a dismissal of the charges based on s 56 of the Justices Act. Whether an argument based on s 56 of the Justices Act was one which could succeed on summary trial of the matters or not, the fact is that the determination that the matters should be dealt with on indictment meant that the argument could not even be raised at the later trial. 
     
      
    42    The decision by the magistrate involved the construction of the statutory provisions to which reference is made below. The decision was one of law and was such as to give rise to “a ground that involves a question of law alone” as that phrase is used in s.104(4) of the Justices Act.  
     
      
    43    If the matters which were the subject of the decision of the Magistrate could not be tested at the present stage of the proceedings they would be lost to the plaintiff. They could not be raised in a demurrer to any indictments. Finally, the procedure under which and circumstances in which the plaintiff would be tried if the decision of the magistrate could not be challenged would be fundamentally different. There would be trial by jury, not by a judicial officer sitting alone. The effect of such a difference is no less than the effect resulting from separate trials being ordered (Regina v Saunders (supra)) or the rejection of a claim for public interest immunity (Attorney General for NSW v Stuart (supra)). 
     
      
    44    The effect of the decision of the Magistrate is in my opinion quite different from a ruling on the admissibility of evidence (Regina v Powch (supra); Regina v Steffan (supra)). It is also different from the rejection of a submission that there is no prima facie case (Regina v Lethlean (supra); Regina v Cheng (supra)) in the same way as it is different from the refusal of a trial judge to disqualify himself (Regina v Rogerson (supra)). 
     
      
    45    The decision by the magistrate will find its way into the record of the Local Court since the result of the decision will be a formal order that the plaintiff be committed for trial.  
     
      
    46    For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that: 
     
      
       
      (i) the decision of the Magistrate involved a question of law; 
       
       
      (ii) such decision had the effect of depriving the plaintiff of a summary trial; 
       
       
      (iii) such decision should be characterised as an interlocutory order to which s 104(4) of the  
      Justices Act 
       applies. 
       
      
    47    For the foregoing reasons, I am of opinion that it is within the jurisdiction of the court to grant leave to appeal against the decision of the Magistrate. As the Crown has conceded that in the event that the court should determine that what was done by the Magistrate fell within s 104(4) of the Justices Act, leave to appeal should be granted, I am of the opinion that it would be appropriate so to do and I formally grant such leave.  
     
      
       
      Is an offence under s178B of the  
      Crimes Act 
       able to be dealt with on indictment, or is it wholly summary? 
       
      
    48    Section 178B of the Crimes Act was inserted by an amendment effected in 1951 (Act No. 31 of 1951). 
     
      
    49    Section 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The following offences must be dealt with summarily: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) an offence that under this or any act is required to be dealt with summarily, 
        
       
       
        
         (b) an offence that under this or any other act is described as a summary offence, 
        
       
       
        
         (c) an offence (not being an offence that under this or any other act is required to be dealt with on indictment) for which the maximum penalty that may be imposed is not, and does not include, imprisonment for more than two years. 
        
       
        
       
        
        (2) An offence may be dealt with summarily if it is an offence that under this or any Act is permitted to be dealt with summarily or on indictment.”  
        
       
      
    50    The penalty provided for an offence under s 178B is less than 2 years imprisonment, namely imprisonment for one year. Therefore, it was argued on behalf of the plaintiff that as the parenthetical clause in s 8(1)(c) had no application to the instant case, the effect of s 8(1)(c) was to mandate a summary hearing of the proceedings. 
     
      
    51    However, Part 2, Division 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act on its face makes a different provision.  
     
      
    52    Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        “ The objects of this division are: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) To require the indictable offences listed in Table 1 to Schedule 1 to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecuting authority or the person charged with the offence concerned elects to have the offence dealt with on indictment; and  
        
       
       
        
        (b) to require the indictable offences listed in Table 2 to Schedule 1 to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecuting authority elects to have the offence concerned dealt with on indictment” 
        
       
      
    53    Part 2 of Table 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act deals with offences relating to property whether under the Crimes Act or the common law. It sets out a list of offences which includes s 178B where the value of the property or the amount of money in question in respect of which the offence is charged does not exceed $5,000.  
     
      
    54    The question for decision is whether the offences under s 178B of the Crimes Act with which the plaintiff stands charged are governed by s 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act or by s 18 and Table 2 of such Act. 
     
      
    55    The plaintiff contends that there is an inconsistency between the two provisions and that when s 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act was amended it impliedly repealed the provisions of s 18 and Table 2 to the extent that they applied to s 178B of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    56    The question of construction depends upon determining the parliamentary intention. In determining such intention regard must be had, inter alia, to the fact that both provisions appear in the same Act and to the general form of s 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act on the one hand and the specific nature of s 18 and Table 2 of that Act on the other hand. 
     
      
    57    The basic rule of construction is that, absent express words of repeal, an existing statutory provision is not repealed or derogated from unless an intention so to do is necessarily to be implied.  
     
      
    58    The usual approach is that unless there are very strong grounds for an implied repeal it should not be found to have occurred. In construing two acts of parliament that are said to be inconsistent the general presumption is that parliament intended that both pieces of legislation should operate. Where the provisions that are said to be inconsistent are both in the same enactment a conclusion that there has been an implied repeal is even more difficult to arrive at than where two different acts of parliament are being construed. In both cases every attempt should be made to reconcile what is said to be the conflicting or competing statutory provisions. One mechanism for achieving this is to treat an apparent inconsistency as an exception to a general rule stated in the competing or conflicting acts or parts of the one act. 
     
      
    59    In the present case there is a provision which requires an offence which carries a penalty of less than two years imprisonment to be dealt with summarily. Section 8 is quite explicit, all such offences “must” be dealt with summarily. Section 18 and Part 2 of Table 2 to Schedule 1 of the same Act requires the prosecution of offences against property, which include offences under s178B, to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecuting authority elects to have such offences dealt with on indictment.  
     
      
    60    The general provision in s 8 should, in my opinion, be read as being subject to the exception provided for in that part of the Act which makes specific provision in relation, inter alia, to s178B of the Crimes Act. So read, the two provisions of the Act, although introduced at different times, are not inconsistent. 
     
      
    61    The consequence of such a construction is that the prosecuting authority has the right of election in relation to the procedure by which the relevant charges will be heard and determined. 
     
      
    62    In the instant case the prosecuting authority has elected to have the charges against the plaintiff under s178B dealt with on indictment. There has been no argument put that the election so to do was, in effect, exercised in the negative at an early stage in the proceedings before the Magistrate and that, as a consequence, it was not thereafter open to the prosecuting authority to make an election to have the offences dealt with on indictment. 
     
      
    63    In the absence of any such argument I do not think it necessary or appropriate to examine the question of negative election and its effect, if any, on a later positive election.  
     
      
    64    For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that the procedure for prosecuting an offence under s 178B of the Crimes Act is governed by the provisions of s 18 and Part 2 of Table 2 to Schedule 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    65    Accordingly, I am of opinion that orders 2, 3 and 4 in the summons of 11 August 2000 should be refused.  
     
      
    66    Orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave given to the plaintiff to appeal in respect of the order made by the Magistrate on 14 July 2000. 
       
       
      2. Otherwise summons dismissed.  
       
       
      3. No order as to costs.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
        
       
     1 HODGSON, JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Greg James, J. and generally with his reasons. 
      
       
     2 The sentencing judge noted that it would offend against the principle in R v. De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 to have regard to criminality involved in crimes with which the applicant had not been charged, and undertook a very careful evaluation of the culpability of the applicant. Accordingly, when the sentencing judge found that the applicant’s “role in this importation” was “of considerably more importance than that of Ferrer”, that should not be understood as suggesting that the judge was proceeding on the basis that the applicant could be sentenced for her role in the importation: rather, “importation” there must, in the light of the judge’s reference to De Simoni, be understood as referring to the overall enterprise which included both importation and initial disposal within Australia.  
      
       
     3 But even so, it seems to me that there was error in the sentencing judge’s analysis. In this case, it was important to have firmly in view that the applicant was not being sentenced in respect of any role whatsoever in the actual importation of drugs, so that any finding as to knowledge or even involvement in the importation could only be used to assess her culpability in relation to the limited involvement with which she was charged, namely her attempt to obtain possession of drugs already brought to Australia. It was appropriate, with a view to avoiding lack of parity, to compare the culpability of the three participants in the overall enterprise; but in my opinion, having regard to the limited involvement with which the applicant was charged, it was an error to conclude that the applicant’s culpability (which was in respect of attempting to obtain possession) was greater than that of Ferrer (which was in respect of importing) and roughly equivalent to that of Milet (which was in respect of knowing involvement in importation). It is true that there is the same maximum penalty applicable to each charge; but there is in my opinion a considerable difference in the magnitude of the objective conduct involved in the three offences in this case, that should find some reflection in assessment of culpability.  
      
       
     4 The sentencing judge was entitled to conclude that the applicant was no dupe of Milet, well knew of the importation, and was more closely connected with the organisers of the importation than was Ferrer. When one takes those matters into account, in my opinion a fair assessment of the appellant’s criminality (in respect of her offence) would put it as less than that of Milet and roughly equivalent to that of Ferrer (in respect of their respective offences).  
      
       
     5 The starting point for the sentence given to Milet, prior to taking account of his guilty plea, must have been in the order of ten years. The starting point for the sentence given to Ferrer, prior to taking account of her guilty plea and the 50% discount for assistance, must have been in the order of eight years. Nevertheless, despite her assessment of the respective criminality of the three participants, and the lack of a guilty plea by the applicant, the sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to eight years’ imprisonment. Presumably, this must have been because of subjective factors favourable to her, referred to by the sentencing judge. 
      
       
     6 In my opinion, the different view I have taken of the relative criminality of the participants justifies the alteration to the sentence proposed by Greg James, J. 
      
       
     7 BARR, J: I agree with Greg James, J. 
      
       
     8 GREG JAMES, J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon her by Ainslie Wallace, DCJ. in respect of her conviction after trial in the District Court of New South Wales on one count of attempting to obtain possession of a commercial quantity of the drug ecstasy. That offence is provided for by s.233B(1)(c) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth).  
      
       
     9 The penalties for offences under s.233B involving narcotic goods are prescribed by the scale set out in s.235 of that Act. The maximum penalty, having regard to the quantity of drug involved, for the offence of which the applicant was convicted, was life imprisonment. A similar penalty is applicable to the offences of importing or being knowingly concerned in the importation of such drugs in similar quantities. 
      
       
     10 The applicant was sentenced to eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years and three months. The head sentence and the non-parole period dated from 20 April 1999, when the applicant went into custody. 
      
       
     11 The applicant's husband, Milet (also known as Cossi) was convicted on his plea of guilty of being knowingly concerned in the importation of the drugs this applicant had attempted to possess and was sentenced by Howie, DCJ. to imprisonment for eight and a half years with a non-parole period of five years. Maria Ferrer had been, on her guilty plea, sentenced by Ainslie-Wallace, DCJ. after having been granted a 50% discount for assistance to imprisonment for three and a half years with a non-parole period of two years on one count of importing the drugs. 
      
       
     12 The learned trial judge set out in her remarks on sentence the factual circumstances giving rise to the applicant's conviction, of which she was satisfied, having regard to the evidence presented at the trial, as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""On 20 April 1999 a suitcase containing 10,000 Ecstasy tablets concealed in a sound mixer was imported into Australia by a Spanish national by the name of Sabate Ferrer, hereafter referred to as Ferrer. The suitcase was inspected at the customs barrier and the drugs detected. At this point Ferrer conceded the importation and agreed to assist the police in effecting controlled delivery of the drugs. To that end, Ferrer was taken to the hotel, which had been nominated to her by those who had arranged for her to bring the drugs to Australia. The drugs were in the main removed from the sound mixer but for a small sample, the mixer reassembled and replaced in the suitcase and taken to the hotel room. 
         
        
        
         
         While Ferrer was in the hotel room and waiting for the bag to be collected as she had been told would happen, she received a telephone call from a person who identified himself as Cossi and who was to arrange for the bag to be collected. Ferrer was also contacted by the person who had given her the drugs to bring into Australia, a person called Amelio who checked whether everything was in order and asked whether the case had been collected. Eventually the person Cossi rang again and asked Ferrer whether she would bring the suitcase downstairs in the hotel to a bar which was outside the hotel. She said she was not able to do that and in response Cossi said that his wife would come and collect the suitcase from her. 
         
        
        
         
         Of the telephone calls received by Ferrer from Cossi one was recorded so far as her side of the conversation was concerned, and as to what was said to her she conveyed that to the police who were with her immediately she hung up. A few minutes later the prisoner arrived at the door. There was a conversation between the prisoner and Ferrer prior to the collection of the suitcase. Both sides of that conversation was recorded and translated into English from Spanish. That conversation is not entirely clear as both Ferrer and the prisoner tended to speak over each other during it. Nonetheless in the conversation, a transcript of which was Exhibit N in the proceedings, the prisoner asks Ferrer whether she needs any methadone tablets and says, 'Lito told me to bring it just in case I have brought you some' at p.6 of that transcript. It was said by Ferrer that Amelio, the person who had sent her to Australia, was referred to otherwise as Lito and I am satisfied that the reference at this point is to Lito. 
         
        
        
         
         At p.8 of the transcript, the prisoner indicates to Ferrer that she will find another hotel for Ferrer because the one in which Ferrer is staying was extremely expensive. Later in the conversation at p.10, the prisoner tells Ferrer, 'we will give you the dough and you can do what you want because you have a ticket for 15 days' in the context of the airline ticket held by Ferrer. At pp.11 and 12, the prisoner says to Ferrer that in a week's time they will give her the dough and she can do then what she wants and until then they will keep paying everything. Finally, at p.14, the prisoner asks Ferrer whether she has enough money and says because normally it is okay to ask for an advance. Piror to the prisoner coming to the hotel room and collecting the suitcase, police observed her to arrive at the hotel and sit at a table at a café which was outside the hotel. Shortly after she arrived she was joined by her husband, Narcisso Milet. I accept that he was otherwise referred to as Cossi. After sitting together for about 10 minutes, he observed to leave and walk away for a short time and then return to the table where the prisoner was sitting. About 10 minutes later she left him and went into the hotel. After collecting the bag the prisoner was observed to come to the street where he husband flagged down a cab and together they walked to the taxi, Milet placed the suitcase in the boot of the cab and they were both arrested. 
         
        
        
         
         After the prisoner was arrested, the hotel room which she was occupying with Milet was searched and her diary was found which contained the telephone number for the hotel at which Ferrer was staying. The travel documents found on the search indicate that the prisoner and her husband travelled to Australia on 18 April 1999 from Bail. After Ferrer and the prisoner were arrested they were taken to prison together and for a time shared a cell and until December 1999 were together in the same wing in prison. During that time, the prisoner had conversations with Ferrer about the person who was referred to as Lito and accepted as being Amelio who had arranged for Ferrer to bring the drugs into Australia and handed the suitcase to Ferrer in Amsterdam. In those conversations, Ferrer said that the prisoner indicated an acquaintance with Amelio and she had his address and wrote to him from prison at an address in Bali. In a particular conversation in this context, the prisoner said to Ferrer words to the effect that it was lucky that she had turned off her mobile phone because she was expecting a call from the purchasers of the drugs. When Ferrer complained to the prisoner that Amelio had promised her that if she was arrested he would send her money for a lawyer but had not, the prisoner replied that he never had any money and that she had given him money to purchase the Ecstasy in Amsterdam."" 
         
        
       
     13 Her Honour held that the conversation with Ferrer was:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""… significant in my view because it reveals an acquaintance with Amelio and the prisoner having dealings with him prior to Ferrer being sent to Australia. The conversation in the hotel room between the prisoner and Ferrer support the prisoner's knowledge of Amelio and Ferrer's trip to Australia when she said that she was told that Ferrer would need methadone tablets."" 
         
        
       
     14 Her Honour concluded that, but for the contents of the conversations which took place in the hotel room and to which she had referred, there would have been support for a submission that the applicant's role was far less than that of Ferrer, and indeed also for the submission that her involvement was last minute, no doubt because of the conversation between Cossi (the applicant's husband, Milet) and Ferrer in which the applicant's husband said that his wife would collect the suitcase after Ferrer had refused to bring it down the stairs to him. As her Honour expressed this conclusion, it is apparent that she found against the two submissions because of the conversations between the applicant and Ferrer and the degree of knowledge of the importation and the circumstances of the participants of the applicant as revealed in those conversations. 
      
       
     15 Her Honour noted the importance of, where possible, assigning to a participant the position in the hierarchy of an importation so as to sentence with regard to the degree of criminality of a particular prisoner's actions. Her Honour identified the purpose of so doing to enable the identifying of the prisoner's role and thus the objective criminality. She distinguished that undertaking from one which could confuse the criminality charged against the offender with that involved in other crimes with which the offender had not been charged, such as to offend against the principle in Regina v. De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. Her Honour referred to her having in mind the cautions which have been expressed about courts striving to characterise the role of a person in an importation but also referred to a perceived necessity to concentrate on the particular participation of the prisoner in the importation to assess properly the criminality and thus determine the appropriate sentence. Her Honour concluded that the material in the trial allowed an assessment of the objective criminality of the offender's action and the role she had performed. She described that role from time to time in her remarks on sentence as the role ""in the importation"" or ""in an importation"" or ""in this importation"". 
      
       
     16 In particular, she found the following:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""From the conversations with Ferrer in the hotel room and the other evidence I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner had a role in this importation which was of considerably more importance than that of Ferrer and which went beyond that of merely collecting the suitcase from Ferrer at the request of Milet. She was in a position to offer financial support for Ferrer and was to pay for Ferrer's accommodation and to supply her with money as an advance. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was aware of the importation of the drugs by Ferrer at the time she attended on the hotel room. She clearly had knowledge of the importation as it was expected to occur and had connections with Amelio who sent Ferrer. She was able to arrange finance for Ferrer and knew enough of Ferrer to know that she was using methadone and to have a supply available to her should that be required. Taken with the conversation between the prisoner and Ferrer in the hotel room it can lead, in my view, to no other conclusion but that her role was more than merely to collect the drugs from Ferrer. 
         
        
        
         
         I cannot find on the evidence what her role was to be once the drug had been collected although from her conversation with Ferrer she was expecting a telephone call from a prospective purchaser but to what end I am unable to find to the requisite standard. That role, as I have found, is however in my view, an important one because it was to facilitate the start of the distribution of drugs in Australia."" 
         
        
       
     17 Her Honour then turned to a consideration of the roles of the others. She noted that the offender Milet had been found by Judge Howie to have been a trusted middle man in the enterprise sent to Australia to take possession of the suitcase of ecstasy, to pass the drugs to the purchasers commencing the distribution chain, to take the money back to Bali and remit it to the person who had asked him to come to Australia. 
      
       
     18 Her Honour noted that Ferrer was sentenced on the basis of her role being that of a courier and of less importance than of Milet. She had offered to and indeed gave evidence against the applicant and her co-operation secured the arrest and plea of guilty of Milet. As a consequence, she had received the 50% discount I have already referred to. 
      
       
     19 When dealing with general deterrence, her Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""In my view this is a very serious matter and clearly the issue of general deterrence must loom large. Those who come to this country for the purpose of participating in the importation and distribution of drugs must expect to receive a sentence which clearly indicates to their countrymen who might be inclined to do the same that they will be met with salutary punishment."" 
         
        
       
     20 Her Honour noted the Crown submission that the role of the applicant was equal to that of her husband and more than Ferrer. She accepted that the applicant's role ""in the importation"" was greater than that of Ferrer but said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""I am not able to describe her role with greater specificity. It was submitted by the Crown that at least her role was one of intermediary in the importation. I accept the submission on behalf of the prisoner that there is no evidence of personal gain for her in her criminal conduct. It was submitted that but for the criminal conduct of Milet and Ferrer, the crime would not have been committed and that the prisoner was merely filling a stopgap role. It may be that it was not anticipated that the prisoner or indeed Milet would collect the suitcase when they went to Ferrer's hotel. However, finding as I have that the prisoner knew sufficient of Ferrer's circumstances to discuss financial support, personal needs and other matters to which I have adverted, she participated in this crime in the full knowledge of what was to take place. She was no mere dupe. Whether she knew these matters from her contact with Amelio or her husband, Milet, is not of consequence for the purposes of sentencing."" 
         
        
       
     21 Her Honour noted that although the prisoner did not give evidence either at the trial or on sentence, she had provided a statement on sentence in which she expressed contrition and contested that she had collected the suitcase with the requisite knowledge. 
      
       
     22 Her Honour referred to a number of subjective circumstances which were in evidence before her, including that the applicant was a woman of 44 years of age; a Spanish national; living as man and wife with Milet at the time of their arrival; had been a self-employed masseuse and French teacher who had been using methadone and heroin at the time of her arrest. (Indeed, she had become unwell during the interview following her arrest for that reason and had been taken to hospital.) She noted the applicant had done a number of educational supportive courses; is highly motivated and co-operative according to the prison authorities; is a woman of intelligence who has used her time in gaol constructively to become free from her drug dependence, notwithstanding her health problems which include having Hepatitis C and being subject to the possibility of operative procedures in consequence of investigation for cancer of the cervix. 
      
       
     23 Her Honour accepted that a sentence which was significant and greater than that of Milet would be disparate and result in a justifiable sense of grievance, but noted that the prisoner was not entitled to the benefit of the plea of guilty that Milet and Ferrer were able to claim. Her Honour had regard to the lack of prior criminal history, the fact that the prisoner had been in custody since 20 April 1999 and that she would be required to serve a sentence outside of her own country in circumstances where her command of the English language was far from perfect. Thus her time in prison would be more difficult for her. 
      
       
     24 Her Honour noted that the prisoner will serve the sentence imposed without the benefit of remissions or reductions in her sentence and she also noted that there was some basis to see some prospect of rehabilitation. Her Honour went on, however, to hold:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Overall, I am not persuaded there are factors which would cause me significantly to alter the statutory ratio between had sentence and non-parole period."" 
         
        
       
     25 A number of submissions have been made contending that her Honour fell into error. It is convenient to deal firstly with the submission that her Honour failed in her sentence to comply with s.16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). I have already noted that her Honour expressly recognised that the applicant would not receive the benefit of remissions or reductions in the sentence. Section 16G provides as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""If a federal sentence is to be served in a prison of a State or Territory where State or Territory sentences are not subject to remission or reduction, the court imposing the sentence must take that fact into account in determining the length of the sentence and must adjust the sentence accordingly."" 
         
        
       
     26 New South Wales is such a State. It is, however, clear from what her Honour said that she took into account that fact. It is contended that when one has regard to the sentence as a whole, her Honour did not adjust the sentence accordingly. There is no express recognition in the remarks on sentence of the necessity the sentence be adjusted accordingly and it is argued that when one has regard to the totality of the sentence in the light of the various considerations, it is apparent that no such adjustment has been made. It was argued that the lack of express reference to making the adjustment showed that it had not occurred. It would have been a better course to have expressly recognised the necessity for the adjustment and expressly to make it. But whether the sentence as passed was affected by the lack of any adjustment can only be ascertained by considering the extent of the sentence in the light of all the other relevant considerations. It will only be necessary to turn again to this matter if, notwithstanding the other criticisms, the sentence should otherwise stand. I will therefore defer dealing with this matter until considering whether the sentence is otherwise appropriate. 
      
       
     27 It was also argued that her Honour erred in the manner in which she came to set the non-parole period when she referred to not being persuaded of factors which would cause her to alter the statutory ratio. Under the relevant sentencing regime which is contained in the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), there is no such statutory ratio. On passing sentence in a matter to which the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), Division 4 of that Act, apply the court must, under s.19AB(1), subject to subsection (3) of that section, fix a non-parole period. (Subsection (3) relates to the court declining to fix a non-parole period having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence and to the antecedents of the person where the court is of the view that not fixing such a period is appropriate.) But unlike s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), no statutory provision is made for a proportionate relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period. Section 44(2) provides for a 75% proportion of non-parole period to overall sentence unless special circumstances are found. It was submitted that it appeared that her Honour had erred by apparently considering some such provision applied here. 
      
       
     28 Customarily, in cases requiring the fixing of a non-parole period under s.19AB, such periods are fixed reflecting a range of between 60% to 66% of the head sentence unless there are such exceptional circumstances as would warrant a much higher non-parole period in a worse class of case or a much lower non-parole period for some exceptional cause, although the authorities recognise that there is no binding rule of law or policy requiring that an individual sentence have, in connection with it, a non-parole period that would fall within the general range. The non-parole period in this case is approximately 66% of the head sentence. There is no such circumstance here as would warrant consideration of a non-parole period greater or less than within the usual range. Although this period is at the higher end of the range, I do not see that as showing in itself an error of principle in the exercise of the discretions or as manifesting unreasonableness. 
      
       
     29 It was submitted that her Honour's reference to not being persuaded indicated that she had applied to the fixing of the non-parole period a presumption in favour of a particular proportion of non-parole period to head sentence unless something akin to special circumstances were shown and had thereby wrongly reasoned as though some persuasive onus existed. Whilst I regard her Honour's language as infelicitous insofar as it appears to parallel the language that might be used in undertaking the task required by s.44(2), I am not persuaded that her Honour fell into any error in the result, having regard to the ambit of a lawful exercise of discretion and the length of the non-parole period imposed and its proportionate relationship to the head sentence. 
      
       
     30 It was submitted that when her Honour made reference to the role of the applicant in the passages in her remarks on sentence to which I have referred above, she erred, since the charge against the applicant was one of attempting to possess the drug rather than importing it or having been knowingly concerned in the importation of it. The submission accepted that the maximum penalty for the offences was the same. However, it was submitted that it was only open to her Honour to have regard to those acts done by the applicant which supported the charge as showing the extent of her culpability, although the context of what had been done in the importation was available to set the scene for considering the gravity of that conduct. 
      
       
     31 In De Simoni (supra), the High Court reiterated the common law principle that it was not open in sentencing to consider the offender's conduct as aggravated by finding against the offender conduct which might have amounted to a more serious crime and which had not been charged. It is submitted that this principle is applicable here. 
      
       
     32 In Regina v. Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, the High Court affirmed the general ambit of the principle and applied that principle to the process of sentencing for crimes against s.233B. In the judgment of Gleeson, CJ., Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan, JJ., it is said, where the Court of Criminal Appeal had held that the identification of the precise nature of the involvement of an accused in an act of importation of drugs is an essential aspect of the sentencing process, at paras 13, 14 and 18-22:- 
      
       
        
         
         "" 
         The significance of the circumstances of the offence 
         
        
        
         
         13. We do not accept that the identification of the precise nature of the accused's involvement in an act of importation of prohibited imports is an essential aspect of the sentencing process. 
         
        
        
         
         14. It is understandable that, in order to promote consistency in sentencing, appellate courts, when expressing views about sentences for drug offences, have sometimes categorised the role of an offender, where that is known, in a scheme of importation or distribution. Similarly, sentencing judges who are dealing with several co-offenders may consider such categorisation relevant in differentiating between individuals. However, the utility of such an exercise is necessarily limited by the extent to which the material facts are known. What may be a convenient shorthand method of describing the facts of particular cases should not be elevated to an essential task to be undertaken in every case, regardless of whether that is possible or appropriate. 
         
        
        
         
         ... 
         
        
        
         
         18. Finally, enquiring about what was done or intended by a person who imported drugs into Australia (apart, that is, from the acts which constitute the importation) will not always be relevant to sentencing that offender for the crime of importation. The offender may have conspired with others to import the drugs; the offender may very well have intended to deal with the drugs in Australia in ways that amount to the commission of the other offences in this country. But it would be quite wrong to sentence an offender for crimes with which that offender is not charged ( 
         Regina v. De Simoni 
          (1981) 147 CLR 383). It seems, however, that the intended purpose of the enquiries which the Court of Criminal Appeal had in mind was to determine the involvement of the respondent 'in any overall scheme for importing drugs into Australia' ( 
         Regina v. Olbrich 
          (1998) 45 NSWLSR 538 at 544, per Spigelman, CJ.). … 
         
        
        
         
         19. Sometimes, when drugs are imported into this country, more than one person connected with the importation of those drugs (or subsequent dealings with them) is prosecuted. Sometimes, those persons will be charged with different offences under the Customs Act. One may be charged with importing the drugs; others may be charged with conspiracy to import prohibited imports (contrary to Customs Act, s.233B(1)(cb)), or being knowingly concerned in the importation of such imports (contrary to Customs Act, s.233B(1)(d)). If several of those persons are convicted of, or plead guilty to, the offences with which they are charged, it will, of course, be necessary to identify any feature that should lead to imposing a different sentence on one from that imposed on another. … Further, it is always necessary, whether one or several offenders are to be dealt with in connection with a single importation of drugs, to bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. … 
         
        
        
         
         20. There are, of course, cases in which only one offender is prosecuted but it is clear that the importation is part of a business venture that is organised hierarchically. In such a case a distinction between courier and principal might be useful to indicate where an offender fitted into the hierarchy of the organisation. … 
         
        
        
         
         21. Whether others stood to gain from the respondent's conduct does not, it seems to us, affect what sentence should have been passed on him. That depended on what he had done and who he was, not on what others may have hoped to gain from his activity."" 
         
        
       
     33 The portions of the judgment omit much of the discussion concerning the usefulness, if any, of attempting to define an offender's role as that of a ""courier"" or ""principal"" with which the judgment was particularly concerned but the principles stated are of direct applicability to this appeal. 
      
       
     34 That discussion emphasises the governing importance to the sentencing task of the precise crime charged against the person to be sentenced and also the necessity to avoid obscuring the culpability involved in what the offender did as so charged by referring to what was done by others in committing other offences. 
      
       
     35 It was submitted that the language her Honour had used showed she had concluded that the applicant was complicit to an extent in the importation and that it was in error having regard to the principles expounded in Olbrich (supra) for her to aggravate the penalty, as it was contended she had, by reason of finding that complicity. In particular it was said her Honour found a role in the applicant extending beyond that which had been charged by reason of the conversations in the hotel room to which I have earlier referred. It was conceded that the conversations were available to rebut any assertion of a lack of full knowledge of what was occurring when the applicant was in the hotel room. Yet, so it was submitted, those conversations were perfectly consistent with the applicant having gained her knowledge from her husband and having been sent to the hotel room, not as a mere dupe but as an expedient adopted because the courier would not come down, in the full knowledge of what was then to take place, that knowledge having only been recently gained. It was submitted that the conversations would not support a finding of more serious criminality so that, it was submitted, her Honour erred in concluding that the applicant ""had a role in this importation"" which was of considerably more importance than that of Ferrer and which went beyond knowingly collecting the suitcase from Ferrer at the request of Milet. In oral argument, it was additionally submitted that if it was open to find the applicant performed a role which went beyond that of so collecting the suitcase from Ferrer at the request of Milet as a stopgap or emergency measure, nonetheless it was not open to her Honour to determine any such seriously culpable role as would have warranted the sentence of imprisonment that she passed, particularly when one has regard to the sentences passed upon those involved in the importation and the limited function the applicant, on the evidence, appeared to have undertaken. It was submitted in the written submissions that her Honour should have determined, having regard to the onus and standard (see Olbrich (supra at para. 27)) that the applicant's role in the offence charged was much more confined than that which merited such a sentence as was passed. 
      
       
     36 Those submissions concede that it was open to the sentencing judge to refer to the entirety of what had occurred (see Regina v. Laurentiu (1992) 63 A. Crim .R. 402, per Wood, J. at 415-416) but as setting the context to the consideration of the culpability of the offender in her doing that which supported the charge against her. 
      
       
     37 It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that her Honour's findings were open to her when considering the entirety of the transaction and that the proper focus of her Honour's enquiry was on ""the applicant's conduct and knowledge relative to the act of collecting the substitute for the narcotics and thus attempt(ing) to possess the original consignment"". It was submitted that it was necessary for the sentencing judge to determine whether the applicant's role was to do no more than collect the drugs or whether it entailed, as was found, some greater degree of criminal responsibility. It was contended that it was open for the trial judge to form a view that a person in the position of the applicant bears greater responsibility than the person who brought the narcotics into the country, and that thus the sentence was appropriate. Reliance was placed on the decision of this court in Regina v. David Alan Lawless (CCA, unreported 24 June 1994) where Hunt, CJ. at CL., in delivering the judgment with which Gleeson, CJ. and Blanch, J. agreed, said:- 
      
       
        
         
         "" 
         The fact that the jury found the applicant not guilty of the charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation does  
         not 
          mean, as has been submitted, that the judge was restricted to the evidence of the admissions made by the applicant to the police. In  
         Regina v. Ferrer-Esis 
          (1991) 55 A. Crim. R. 231 at 239, this court said that a particular circumstance relevant to both an importation offence and a possession offence may be taken into account upon the possession offence (to which the prisoner there had pleaded guilty) notwithstanding that it could also have been taken into account upon an importation offence (with which he had not been charged).  
         
        
        
         
         In determining the nature of the applicant's possession offence for the purpose of sentencing the applicant, it was appropriate for the judge to have regard to the entire transaction:  
         Regina v. Laurentiu & Becheru 
          (at 415); including what he expected to take possession of and what he was going to do with it when he obtained possession - whether, for example, the drugs were for his own use, or whether he was in possession of them in the course of a commercial narcotic venture in which he was taking part as a middleman attached to an organized distribution chain:  
         ibid 
          (at 415-416); in other words, whether the possession related to that of an intermediary or principal in the course of an enterprise or whether it was merely that of an end user:  
         ibid 
          (at 418). 
         
        
        
         
         Nor are those facts upon which the judge relied denied relevance by the sentencing principle laid down in  
         The Queen v. De Simoni 
          (1981) 147 CLR 383. A sentencing judge may take into account all of the conduct of the prisoner, including that which would aggravate the offence, but may not take into account as matters of aggravation facts established in the evidence which would have warranted a conviction for a  
         more serious 
          offence or which would have rendered the prisoner liable to a  
         more serious 
          penalty than that which is prescribed for the offence of which he has been found guilty:  
         ibid 
          (at 389, 392). Both offences involved in this trial carry the same maximum sentence: Customs Act 1901, s.233B (Cwth). Moreover, as this court also said in  
         Regina v. Ferrer-Esis 
          (at 239), the offence of possession is not necessarily a less serious offence than that of importing the drugs; it may or may not be, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case, and in particular upon the involvement of the individual prisoner in each: and see  
         Regina v. Thiagarajah 
          (1989) 41 A. Crim. R. 45 at 50;  
         Regina v. Lam 
          (1991) 53 A. Crim. R. 118 at 119-120;  
         Regina v. Laurentiu & Becheru 
          (at 419). "" 
          
           
         
        
       
     38 So far as those observations do not accord with the approach of the High Court in Olbrich (supra), they are no longer to be followed. That portion of the judgment as might suggest that the principles in De Simoni (supra) cannot apply because the offences have the same maximum sentence and that all the conduct of the prisoner may be taken into account must be qualified by reference to the principles in Olbrich (supra) in which specific reference was made to De Simoni (supra) in the joint judgment as supporting the principles then enunciated. 
      
       
     39 I am therefore unable to accept the submissions of the Crown. Whilst I accept that there was evidence that the applicant was no mere dupe and had an involvement in attempting to possess the drugs which extended beyond that of merely knowing that she was to go to the room and obtain the drugs, I am unable to see any sound basis for any finding, even having regard to the wider context, fairly open on the evidence to which her Honour referred, to enable a conclusion that the applicant had taken any more culpable part ""in the importation"" than to seek to obtain possession of the drugs at the hotel by way of collecting the suitcase for her husband, albeit that she performed that role with the knowledge and offering the financial support and drugs to the courier to which her Honour referred. There is a considerable distance in terms of culpability between that position and a culpability more than that of Ferrer and roughly equivalent to that of Milet. Her Honour concluded that her role was more than merely to collect the drugs and said ""I cannot find, on the evidence, what her role was to be once the drug had been collected"", but also said ""that role as I have found is, however, in my view an important one because it was to facilitate the start of the distribution of drugs in Australia"". So much may be accepted. But neither that finding nor the applicant's knowledge and actions goes so far as establish culpability which would support a sentence having rough parity with that of Milet or that of Ferrer (disregarding in that case the 50% discount). I do not see on the materials that a conclusion that the applicant's role was greater than that of Ferrer, and approaching that of Milet, was fairly open. The words her Honour used when referring to the sentences, ""those who come to this country for the purpose of participating in the importation and distribution of drugs"" must expect are equally as appropriate to Milet and Ferrer, and in my view, more so. 
      
       
     40 The absence of personal gain and the role of her husband speak against the Crown submission that her role was one of ""an intermediary in the importation"". That word ""intermediary"" in this context is at least, vague and as to her being concerned ""in the importation"" bearing in mind the charge, it was hardly open to the Crown to make that submission. On the other hand, I do not accept that the offender was merely filling a stopgap role. In my view, the evidence supports a conclusion that the applicant willingly and knowingly engaged in the pick up of the drugs from a person she knew to be an international courier to provide them to her husband who she knew was knowingly concerned in the importation and delivery to whom she knew would commence the process of distribution. This is a more confined but still very culpable, if not so culpable, role. 
      
       
     41 I reach this conclusion having regard, to her Honour's findings of fact on the evidence to which she refers and particularly the evidence of the conversations. Thus it is apparent that it is my view that the role the prisoner fulfilled, whilst not as culpable as that for which the Crown submitted, and more culpable than that for which the defence submitted at trial, was a role which did merit a severe sentence but did not merit a sentence of the severity of that which was passed upon her. 
      
       
     42 In my view, the submissions of the applicant that the sentence, in all the circumstances, is excessive, have been made good. I therefore do not consider it necessary to resolve these remaining questions I have earlier referred to. Leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal upheld, the sentence passed below quashed, and in lieu thereof, the applicant be sentenced, having regard to the matters in s.16A and giving the adjustment by s.16G, to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and nine months to date from 20 April 1999. The sentence will expire on 19 April 2005. The non-parole period should expire on 19 January 2003 when the applicant will become eligible for release on parole on conditions, the breach of which might cause her to be returned to custody because of a revocation of that parole. The court's judgment is to be furnished to the applicant to constitute the explanation required by s.16F of the Crimes Act 1914.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of the sentences imposed upon the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales at Campbelltown for a number of offences which were placed on an indictment in consequence of there being some difficulty with the papers, the offender having indicated a plea of guilty before the magistrate and pleading guilty to the offences arraigned. 
      
       
     2 The offences comprised count one, robbery armed with an offensive weapon on 27 March 2001; count two, steal a motor vehicle on 28 March 2001; count three, another count of robbery armed with an offensive weapon committed on 29 March 2001; count four, another robbery armed with an offensive weapon committed on 30 March 2001; count five, steal a motor vehicle committed on 27 March 2001. 
      
       
     3 The crimes of robbery armed with an offensive weapon under s.97(6) of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. Those of steal a motor vehicle are, pursuant to s.154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. 
      
       
     4 The applicant had been arrested on 3 April 2001 and had been in continuous custody since that date. 
      
       
     5 On each charge, the trial judge imposed sentences as follows: count one, imprisonment for a fixed term of two years to commence on 3 April 2001 and to expire on 2 April 2003; on count two, a fixed term of imprisonment for nine months to commence on 3 April 2001 and thus expiring on 2 January 2002; on count three, imprisonment for a fixed term of two years to commence on 3 April 20001 and to expire on 2 April 2003; on count four, imprisonment for three years and four months to commence on 3 April 2002 and to expire on 2 August 2005; on count five, a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months to commence on 3 April 2001 and to expire on 2 January 2002. In respect of the sentence on count four, his Honour directed a non-parole period of two years to commence on 3 April 2002 and to expire on 2 April 2004. 
      
       
     6 His Honour gave to the appellant the benefit of an early plea, noting that it had been conceded she was entitled to the discount on the basis that the pleas were entered at the earliest opportunity.  
      
       
     7 He noted that the co-offender, to whom I will refer shortly, had been arrested following a pursuit of a vehicle in which the two had absconded and that after his arrest he had identified her to the police as one of his co-offenders. But he also noted that in response to a telephone call on 3 April, police went to a house in Bass Hill where they spoke to a Miss Lewis who informed them that the applicant wished to give herself up. At the police station she volunteered the information as to the robberies she had been involved in, saying as she did so, ""I just want to get off the drugs and going to gaol will help"". In interviews with the police she admitted her own involvement but declined to furnish further information concerning the involvement of others. 
      
       
     8 Having regard to those matters and in particular having regard to the earlier plea before the magistrate, the trial judge fixed the utilitarian value of the plea at about 25%. 
      
       
     9 He had regard to her contrition but also to the strength of the Crown case, although his Honour does not appear to have expressly adverted to the assistance she furnished to the prosecuting authority in the way in which she divulged the robberies and her own involvement. His Honour expressed the view, ""notwithstanding those matters, she is entitled to credit for the contrition that she has shown by giving herself up and then by admitting her involvement in these offences and I intend to make an allowance for that contrition, however I have taken the strength of Crown case into account in that process"". It is apparent that his Honour had regard to the matters which I have referred when assessing contrition rather than on some formulation as to the utilitarian aspect for which she was entitled to credit when sentencing. 
      
       
     10 He noted that during the commission of one of the robberies she apologised to the victim saying to him, ""I have to because I have to survive, I'm sorry"". 
      
       
     11 His Honour referred to two matters in her history as principally important in relation to the commission of the crimes, the facts of which I will refer to shortly. They were, firstly, her addiction to drugs and the consequent need to commit offences for the purpose of feeding her drug habit, and secondly, her involvement with the co-offender, Bradley Lewis, a person who is some 20 months younger than her in age. This involvement had extended over a considerable period, and in an attempt to break the cycle of dependence on drugs and involvement with Lewis, her parents had even gone to the extent of seeking to move the family to Melbourne. That had been unsuccessful. 
      
       
     12 She had indeed admitted in her interviews with the police her dependence on drugs and her involvement with Bradley Lewis and the involvement of both of them with drugs. His Honour noted that when asked by the police ""Well, how are you going to get off the drugs?"". She answered, ""Go to rehab. I reckon the best way is to go through court and do it"". She pointed out that she hadn't been in trouble with the police for quite a long time and had never been in gaol; that her head was mixed up and she did these things for money for drugs. 
      
       
     13 His Honour made the following findings favourable to her: that she intends to carry out a drug rehabilitation programme. That she is sincere in her attitude towards giving up drugs. That she had begun the first steps on what might be a long path to rehabilitate herself. 
      
       
     14 His Honour referred to the reflection of the author of the pre-sentence report which was before him that the applicant had a loving and supportive family, accepted her responsibility for her own drug usage and subsequent criminal activity, and had indicated her willingness not only to embark on the drug rehabilitation programme, but to return to her parents when the programme was completed. 
      
       
     15 His Honour concluded that it appeared that she was more a follower that an instigator or ringleader and had reference to her psychological profile in that regard. He concluded that her remaining in custody for a lengthy period with ultimately hardened criminal types is likely to prove detrimental and that in the circumstances, a lengthy probation and parole supervision would be of benefit to the prisoner. 
      
       
     16 The facts shortly of the offences were that on 27 March 2001 she and the co-offender, he armed with a machete, robbed a shopkeeper of $500 and a quantity of cigarettes. On 28 March they stole the motor vehicle to which the second count relates. On 29 March, armed with the same machete, Mr. Keena was robbed of $600, a mobile phone, condoms and a quantity of cigarettes. On the fourth charge, the co-offender armed with a machete, robbed Andreas of $600, a quantity of telephone recharge cards and chocolate bars and there was, in addition, the theft of the motor vehicle. 
      
       
     17 In respect to the conduct embraced by the first count, his Honour particularly adverted to the fright occasioned to the victim and that the victim was terrified of the actions of the accomplice. It was to that shopkeeper that the applicant apologised. This was a robbery carried out late at night against a convenience store employee in a vulnerable position. Although the threatening weapon was used, there was no intent to inflict harm upon the shopkeeper. His Honour did not conclude that there had been any notable degree of planning. 
      
       
     18 The vehicle involved in the second offence was recovered intact except for damage to the ignition barrel and locks. It had been used as the get-away vehicle in relation to the robbery of 29 March 2001. The obtaining of the vehicle did indicate to his Honour some degree of planning. The robbery which was committed in very much the same way by production by the co-accused of the machete, but it was the prisoner who picked up the condoms and packets of cigarettes and ran after the accomplice who had rifled the till. Again, the same considerations to which his Honour had adverted concerning the vulnerability of the victim are reflected in his Honour's remarks. 
      
       
     19 The robbery of 30 March 2001 was that of a service station at Padstow. The co-offender utilised what was apparently a machete but which was described as a ""large timber handle thing with a triangle metal bit on the end"" by the victim. The victim was threatened, the cash register money tray rifled, and the co-offender demanded the phone recharge cards. The prisoner who had been present during the exercise went with the offender and a third person who had been engaged in the commission of that offence when they left. It was on that occasion that the police pursued the escape vehicle and the co-offender was arrested. It was in that factual context that his Honour passed the sentences in respect of which this application is brought. 
      
       
     20 The effect of the total sentence passed by his Honour is that the applicant will have to serve a non-parole period of three years and be subject to a total sentence of four years and four months imprisonment dating from the time she went into custody.  
      
       
     21 The co-offender, Bradley Lewis was, because of his age, sentenced for his part in the offences in the Children's Court to a control order for 15 months with a non-parole period of nine months. We have been informed that, unlike the present applicant, he did not fully admit his part in all of the offences upon being charged. He had a criminal history comprising a number of pages of offences unlike the applicant who has only three minor prior matters on her record. The material provided to the Children's Court when dealing with him referred to his tragic family background and in particular the pressures created upon him to commit crime arising from the criminal behaviour of his family and relatives. 
      
       
     22 The evidence before the magistrate and before the learned trial judge was that it was the co-offender who carried the machete and that the role of the applicant was a lesser one. 
      
       
     23 It is contended that the learned trial judge fell into error in a number of ways. Firstly, that he failed to give sufficient weight to contrition and remorse. It will be apparent from what I have said that the trial judge expressly noted the applicant's contrition and remorse. I apprehend that the submission made, however, is that his appreciation of those matters was it not translated into the ultimate sentence. Secondly, it is submitted that the trial judge failed to give due weight to the applicant's lesser role in the offences. This submission leads into a further submission that his Honour failed to have sufficient regard to that matter, to her limited criminal history and her prospects of rehabilitation and thus erred. 
      
       
     24 It was also submitted that the trial judge failed to have sufficient regard to appropriate parity in the sentence that was ultimately passed having regard to the sentence that had been passed on the co-offender. 
      
       
     25 It was, however, argued by the Crown that having regard in particular to the different regimes and the different purposes which it is submitted the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 seeks to achieve by at least a different weighting of the sentencing considerations applicable to children, that limited regard should be given to any parity considerations when considering any asserted grievance by persons who have been sentenced as adults in consequence of apparently disparate sentences imposed on co-offenders who are children. 
      
       
     26 The Crown has further argued that although there is a discretion in the court where the sentences are disparate such as here, that discretion would not be enlivened where there is a sentence, as it is submitted there is here, upon a co-offender under a Children's Court regime which is so inadequate that a sense of grievance engendered should no longer be regarded as a legitimate one. 
      
       
     27 Reference has been made to the decisions of this court in Regina v. Diamond (unreported, 18 February 1993); Regina v. Steele (unreported, 17 April 1997). We have further been referred to Regina v. GDP (1991) 54 A. Crim. R. 112; Regina v. Govinden (1999) 106 A. Crim. R. 316; Regina v. Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432, and Regina v. Coglan [1999] NSWCCA 292. In the last decision there appears in the judgment of the Chief Justice the following:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""In  
         Regina v. Govinden 
          [1999] NSWCCA 118, Dunford, J., who delivered the judgment of the court, referred to the authority in the court to the effect that parity considerations do not arise, as such, when comparing a person dealt with in the Children's Court and adults. Nevertheless as his Honour indicated at paragraph 376 of that judgment, that does not mean that the sentence imposed on a person in the Children's Court, which would otherwise give rise to issues of parity, is irrelevant. This is so for the reason that an individual sentenced as an adult may very well have a justifiable sense of grievance with respect to that very difference of the regimes, the strictures of which Sully, J. has referred to in his judgment. "" 
         
        
       
     28 This is not, in my view, a case in which it is necessary to resolve precisely the ambit of the regard the court may have when sentencing an adult offender to that sentence which was passed upon a co-offender in the Children's Court where that latter sentence is, in the opinion of a sentencing judge, grossly inadequate. 
      
       
     29 Having regard to the entirety of factors in this case in the applicant's favour and noted by the trial judge, having regard to the difference between the two sentences, including the differing regimes under which the sentences will be served, and the Crown's concession that the discretion to intervene is enlivened should the court wish to intervene, this is a case, in my view, where the court should intervene. 
      
       
     30 In my view, having regard to those matters, the application for leave to appeal should be allowed. The matters that I have set out concerning the applicant's prospects for rehabilitation, her youth, this being the first gaol sentence she is to undergo, her contrition, her early plea of guilty - both of which tend to affirm the prospect noted by the trial judge for rehabilitation - and her willingness to enter a custodial rehabilitation centre, constitute special circumstances. 
      
       
     31 In my view, the appeal should be allowed, the sentence below quashed and in lieu thereof on counts one and three, there should be imposed a fixed term of 18 months to commence on 3 April 2001, expiring 2 October 2002. On count four, there should be imposed a sentence of two years, nine months imprisonment commencing on 3 April 2001 and expiring on 2 January 2004. That sentence, therefore, will be wholly concurrent with the sentences imposed on counts one and three. On that sentence there should be a non-parole order in respect of a non-parole period of 18 months expiring on 2 October 2002. The sentences of nine months for a fixed term should remain on the remaining counts. 
      
       
     32 There should be a parole order providing for release to supervised parole pursuant to the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2000, Clause 67, and including a provision that until the parole order ceases to have effect, the applicant is to submit to the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service and/or such other body as she is referred to by that service for drug rehabilitation. That will require the use of form three to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2000. The order should remain in force until the end of the term of imprisonment provided for in the sentence. 
      
       
     33 SMART, AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     34 GREG JAMES, J: The orders of the court therefore will be as I have proposed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 IPP AJA: This is a Crown appeal against sentence. The respondent pleaded guilty to and was convicted of a contravention of s 233B(1)(ca) of the Customs Act 1901. The charge involved the respondent being in possession of a prohibited import, namely a commercial quantity of heroin. The quantity concerned was 2.779 kilograms of a substance containing heroin which when analysed was found to contain 1.723 kilograms of heroin.  
      
       
     2 Schedule 6 of the Customs Act specifies a commercial quantity of heroin as 1.5 kilograms of pure heroin. By s 235(2)(c)(i) of the Customs Act the penalty for contravention of s 235B(1) involving a commercial quantity of heroin is a fine of $750,000 or imprisonment for life or both. As the respondent had a prior conviction for a similar offence he was, by virtue of s 235(2)(ii)(A) liable to the maximum penalty. 
      
       
     3 Taylor DCJ sentenced the respondent to 10 years imprisonment, commencing on 6 September 2000, with a non-parole period of 7 ½ years to expire on 5 March 2000. His Honour ordered that the respondent be eligible for parole. He said that, pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), he had taken into account two offences committed by the respondent in breach of s 82(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. 
      
       
     4 The Crown submitted that Taylor DCJ erred in two respects: 
      
       
        
       (a) It was said that Taylor DCJ imposed a sentence so low as to fall outside a proper exercise of sentencing discretion. 
        
        
       (b) It was said further that Taylor DCJ, in effect, imposed a separate sentence on the respondent for the  
       Proceeds of Crime Act 
        offences, instead of merely taking those offences into account when sentencing for the  
       Customs Act 
        offence (as he was required to do). 
        
       
     5 The criminal transactions in which the respondent was involved, giving rise to the offence, took place on 4 and 5 September 2000. Pursuant to these transactions the respondent supplied a co-accused Gi Leung Chung with the heroin in question. The transactions involved a series of clandestine arrangements and several telephone calls using code words. The telephone calls were intercepted by the police and the arrangements were observed. This led to the apprehension of the respondent. The police took possession of the heroin which was identified as originating in South East Asia. It was therefore imported into Australia. 
      
       
     6 The wholesale value of the heroin was between $540,000 and $640,000 and the street value, calculated on one ounce deals of 25% purity, was between $1,476,000 and $2,461,000.  
      
       
     7 The Proceeds of Crime Act charges involved a sum of $4,667.20 located on the respondent’s person when he was arrested and $60,000 in cash in a bedside drawer in his premises. 
      
       
     8 In dealing with the respondent’s role in the dealings with the heroin, Taylor DCJ found that the respondent was a principal. Apart from Chung, the respondent’s son was involved in the supply of the drugs and others may have been involved as well. Taylor DCJ said that the respondent was the person who organised the supply of drugs to Chung, presumably for their distribution. The respondent was the highest in the hierarchy of those involved in the particular transactions and the person most responsible for the relevant arrangements. 
      
       
     9 This was not the only serious offence involving narcotic drugs that the respondent, in his lifetime, has committed. In 1991 he was convicted of contravening s 233B of the Customs Act (being in possession of a trafficable quantity of heroin). He was sentenced for this offence by Sully J who also sentenced him for certain firearm offences. Sully J imposed an overall sentence of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven years. Effectively, his Honour imposed a head sentence of nine years imprisonment and a non-parole period of six years in respect of the heroin charges. 
      
       
     10 When the respondent was released on parole in respect of the s 233B offence, he very soon committed breaches of parole conditions relating to notification of residence, approval of employment and failing to obtain permission before leaving New South Wales. The latter breach was particularly relevant as it involved visits by him to the Crown Casino in Melbourne. There he gambled and lost large sums of money. These losses caused him once again to embark on a course of drug dealing that in turn led to the sentence imposed by Taylor DCJ. The fact is that the respondent committed the offences less than six months after he was released on parole on 15 March 2000. 
      
       
     11 Prior to Taylor DCJ sentencing the respondent, Gi Leung Chung was sentenced by Coorey DCJ to nine years imprisonment as from 6 September 2000 with a non-parole period of six years. Chung was also sentenced on two proceeds of crime charges to six months imprisonment, to be served concurrently with the principal charge.  
      
       
     12 Taylor DCJ considered that there were two factors that particularly mitigated the criminality of the offence. These were the plea of guilty and the co-operation the respondent had afforded the authorities.  
      
       
     13 Taylor DCJ considered that the respondent should be treated as if he pleaded guilty at the earliest practical opportunity. His Honour noted however that the Crown case was very strong. Nevertheless, he considered that the plea had a utilitarian benefit. He said that the discount for the plea of guilty should be at the lower end of the range.  
      
       
     14 The level of the respondent’s co-operation with the authorities was described by the latter as moderate. Nevertheless, his Honour held that the assistance had been to real effect and the respondent was entitled to a significant discount accordingly. The learned judge observed that the respondent, in co-operating with the authorities, had been motivated partly by self-interest and partly because of despair. He had been frank to the police.  
      
       
     15 Applying R v Thomson [2000] 49 NSWLR 383 Taylor DCJ decided that the respondent was entitled to a discount of three and a half years by reason of his plea of guilty and co-operation with authorities. 
      
       
     16 His Honour then proceeded to explain how he arrived at the ultimate sentence that was imposed. It is necessary to go into this in some detail as it forms the basis of the second ground of appeal.  
      
       
     17 Having referred to the particular circumstances of the offence, Taylor DCJ said that he would take into account general deterrence which he regarded as “a very significant aspect of sentencing”. He then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “A sentence of 15 years imprisonment is appropriate for the offences of possession of a prohibited import”.  
         
        
        
       He stated that he would adjust that sentence pursuant to s 16G of the  
       Crimes Act 
        to 10 years. At that stage, it seems that the judge had arrived at a head sentence of 10 years. 
        
       
     18 Taylor DCJ proceeded: 
      
       
        
         
         “The sentence is further adjusted to six and a half years by reason of the plea of guilty and the cooperation with authorities. I impose an additional 12 months sentence in total in respect of the two proceeds of crime matters to be added to the non-parole period”. 
          
           
         
        
       
     19 The approach so adopted is difficult to understand. It seems that the learned judge did not reduce the head sentence of 10 years by reason of the plea of guilty and the cooperation with the authorities (as he said he was going to do) but took these matters into account solely when fixing the non-parole period. Presumably, when he had stated that the sentence would be reduced to six and a half years, he meant only that the non-parole period would be fixed at that term. 
      
       
     20 Similarly, although he said that he would impose an additional twelve months imprisonment in respect of the Proceeds of Crime offences, in fact he increased only the non-parole period by this amount and did not alter the head sentence.  
      
       
     21 In the result, his Honour sentenced the respondent to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 ½ years. This was the sentence actually pronounced. 
      
       
     22 After orders had been made by Taylor DCJ to this effect, the following exchange occurred between counsel for the Crown and the judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “STAEHLI: Can I just further say in clarification if your Honour doesn’t mind, your Honour has increased the non parole period by one year in respect of the matters in the schedule as your Honour expressed. It follows from that, I suppose, your Honour, that your Honour has in effect increased the head sentence by a similar proportion in order to take into account the matters on the schedule, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         STAEHLI: Sorry, when I say a similar proportion, would the proportion which has gone to make up that part of the ten years which your Honour imposed as the head sentence reflect the same ratio as your Honour suggested before your Honour added the year to the non parole period? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         STAEHLI: So it was ten years with six and a half years non parole. That ten years, though, includes an amount for the taking into account of the matters on the schedule as well, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes.” 
         
        
       
     23 The following comments can be made about this exchange. Firstly, his Honour’s affirmative response to the first question was plainly wrong. His Honour had not in effect increased the head sentence (as counsel suggested) in order to take into account the Proceeds of Crime offences. He had arrived at a head sentence of 10 years after applying the reduction required by s 16G of the Crimes Act to his starting point of 15 years for the drug offence. Secondly, the second question posed by counsel is difficult to understand, even though his Honour answered it in the affirmative.  
      
       
     24 Counsel for the Crown on appeal submitted that this exchange should be understood as meaning that Taylor DCJ had imposed a sentence of eight years eight months imprisonment on the drug charge, with a non-parole period of six years, and an additional sentence of 18 months imprisonment with a non parole period of one year on the Proceeds of Crime offences. I do not accept this argument. Firstly, the orders made by Taylor DCJ are clear on their face and are not in the terms for which the Crown contends. Secondly, the exchange on which the Crown relies occurred after the orders were made. Thirdly, the questions posed of his Honour were obscure in meaning and it is not possible to know what the judge understood them to mean. In my view, the sentence must be approached on the basis that the judge intended the words he uttered when pronouncing sentence to mean what they conveyed in their terms.  
      
       
     25 While I am unable to comprehend the basis of the learned judge’s reasoning in determining the effect of the plea of guilty and cooperation with the authorities, it is plain that he intended to give due credit for these matters in determining the composite sentence. In my view, it is that sentence, looked at in the context of all the relevant circumstances pertaining to the criminality of the respondent’s conduct, that has to be examined in determining the arguments raised in this appeal.  
      
       
     26 I agree with the submissions made by the respondent that, despite saying “I impose an additional 12 months sentence in total in respect of the two Proceeds of Crime matters”, Taylor DCJ did not in fact impose a separate sentence in respect of the latter offences. This conclusion requires some explanation.  
      
       
     27 In passing sentence, Taylor DCJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Your sentence is taken to have commenced on 6 September 2000. I impose a non-parole period of 7 ½ years to expire on 5 March 2000 [sic] when you’ll be eligible for parole”. 
         
        
       
     28 Earlier he had stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “In relation to the conviction and sentence of possession of a prohibited import I have taken into account the offences under the  
         Proceeds of Crime Act 
          1987 admitted by the offender and contained in the Form 1 document under Schedule 3 of the Crimes Regulations”. 
         
        
       
     29 During the course of his sentencing remarks he expressly referred to the respondent’s request that the two Proceeds of Crime offences be taken into account pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act. He proceeded to say that he had taken those admitted offences “into account”. 
      
       
     30 I accept the submission made on behalf of the respondent that the judge, by saying “I impose an additional 12 months sentence in total in respect of the two Proceeds of Crime matters”, thereby intended merely to take the two matters into account by increasing the non-parole period.  
      
       
     31 I would therefore not uphold the argument that Taylor DCJ, in effect, imposed a separate sentence on the respondent for the Proceeds of Crime Act offences, instead of merely taking them into account when sentencing for the Customs Act offence. 
      
       
     32 As regards the other ground of appeal, it was submitted on behalf of the Crown that Taylor DCJ failed to make any real allowance for: 
      
       
        
       (a) The fact that the offence in question was the respondent’s second serious narcotics offence. 
        
        
       (b) The maximum sentence faced by the respondent was life imprisonment. 
        
        
       (c) The offence was committed within six months of the expiration of the respondent’s parole period for his first offence and the parole had been revoked because the respondent had breached the conditions thereof. 
        
        
       (d) The respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation were limited. 
        
       
     33 Taylor DCJ made specific reference to the previous narcotics offence committed by the respondent. Plainly, he took that fact into account. It was particularly significant that the latest offence took place so soon after the respondent was released on parole in respect of the sentence for the earlier offence. But his Honour was well aware of that.  
      
       
     34 Of course, the prior offence could not have led to an increase in sentence beyond what the learned judge considered to be an appropriate sentence for the offence for which he was sentencing the respondent: Veen (No 2) v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 465 (at 477); Baumer v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 51 (at 57-58).  
      
       
     35 In Veen (No 2) the majority, after re-affirming the last-mentioned principle, said (at 477): 
      
       
        
         
         “The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted”. 
         
        
        
       Their Honours went on to state that the antecedent criminal history may be taken into account when it is relevant to the moral culpability of the offender, or his propensity or the need to impose a condign punishment for the purposes of personal and general deterrence.  
        
       
     36 In this case it seems to me that the judge did not give sufficient consideration to the fact that the respondent committed a serious drug offence so soon after being discharged from custody. However, that fact, alone, would not justify this Court overturning the sentence. The question remains whether in all the circumstances the sentence was outside his Honour’s discretion.  
      
       
     37 On behalf of the Crown it was submitted that, in the light of the moderate degree of assistance afforded to the authorities by the respondent, the learned judge was generous in the reduction of three and a half years that he gave for mitigating circumstances. I agree with this submission, but I am not persuaded that that reduction was beyond discretion. 
      
       
     38 Taylor DCJ referred expressly to the fact that the respondent faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. He noted that parole had been revoked because the respondent had breached conditions. The consequence of these matters was essentially for the sentencing judge to determine.  
      
       
     39 As regards the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation, it may well be that those prospects were limited. But Taylor DCJ did not take rehabilitation into account in sentencing the respondent so it cannot be said that he made any error in this respect. 
      
       
     40 I also accept that, generally, principals involved in the narcotics trade should be given condign punishment: R v Hamzy (2000) NSWCCA 539. This rule must be seen, however, against the observations of the High Court in The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 where the majority said (at 279): 
      
       
        
         
         “Further, it is always necessary, whether one or several offenders are to be dealt with in connection with a single importation of drugs, to bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. Characterising the offender as a ‘courier’ or a ‘principal’ must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did”. 
         
        
       
     41 Counsel for the Crown pointed out that the respondent was responsible for the organised movement of drugs around Sydney, he involved his son in the criminal transaction, he also involved Chung and perhaps others as well. He deliberately flouted his parole conditions, and demonstrated a continued disobedience to the law in the sense said to be relevant in Veen (No 2). These matters, however, were all mentioned by Taylor DCJ in the course of his sentencing remarks and it cannot be said that he erred in not taking them into account.  
      
       
     42 I agree with the Crown’s submissions that the overall effect of the respondent’s conduct demonstrated a degree of criminality that called for a far higher starting point than that adopted by the sentencing judge. I come to this conclusion particularly because of the dominant role the respondent played in the transactions and the fact that he committed the offence so soon after leaving prison. But again, it does not necessarily follow from these matters that the appeal should succeed.  
      
       
     43 Where error in the sentencing process has not been demonstrated the Crown faces a difficult task in attempting to overturn a sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate. See the comments of Spigelman CJ in Baker v R (2000) NSWCCA 85. In Wong & Leung [2001] HCA 64 the High Court said (at 58) that: 
      
       
        
         
         “Appellate intervention is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons.” 
         
        
       
     44 In an effort to demonstrate that there had been appealable error, counsel for the Crown referred to cases where the sentences imposed were arguably far more substantial than those in the present instance. I am, however, not persuaded that the sentence imposed by Taylor DCJ, in the particular circumstances, was below the range. 
      
       
     45 I have said that in my view his Honour’s starting point of 15 years imprisonment was too low. But the fundamental question before this court is whether the ultimate sentence passed was too law. It is not whether the starting point was too low.  
      
       
     46 In my view the starting point should have been between 21 and 23 years. I do not accept that it should have been significantly higher. Although the respondent bore paramount responsibility for the transactions, and although he was high up on the chain of supply, he was not the importer of the heroin, nor could he be described as a person responsible for the storage or distribution or control of large quantities of heroin. Rather, the heroin the subject of the charge must have been acquired by the respondent from such a person. Moreover, while the amount of heroin possessed by the respondent was a commercial quantity, and its value was substantial, the quantity, in relative terms, was not at the upper end of the scale.  
      
       
     47 Taking into account a starting point in the vicinity of the range I have postulated, when regard is had to the reduction required by s 16G of the Crimes Act and the discount of three and a half years for the plea of guilty and co-operation with authorities, the result would not be a difference in sentencing that should result in a successful appeal. I also bear in mind that the non-parole period, when considered relative to the head sentence, is higher than usual. 
      
       
     48 In my view, the overall sentence imposed by his Honour was within discretion. That, in my view, is the overriding consideration in this appeal which, for the reasons I have expressed, I would dismiss.  
      
       
     49 DUNFORD J: I agree that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Ipp AJA, but I do so with some hesitation and ultimately only because of the principles which apply to Crown appeals. I consider that the sentence imposed was unduly lenient, but I am not persuaded that it was so far outside the permissible range as to justify the intervention of this Court. 
      
       
     50 BURCHETT AJ: I agree with the reasons of the presiding judge. 
      
       
     51 IPP AJA: The order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed.

      Judgment 
     1 HODGSON JA: On 19 November 2001, in proceedings brought by the appellants against the respondent, Newcastle City Council, alleging negligence on the party of the Council and its officers, Walmsley DCJ rejected the principal allegation of negligence but, on a second allegation, gave judgment in favour of the appellants for $20,000.00 plus interest under s.81A of the District Court Act from November 1995. On that day also, the primary judge ordered the respondent to pay the appellant’s costs of the proceedings, although it appears that on 12 November 2001 he substituted an order that the respondent pay 35% of the appellants’ costs of the proceedings.  
      
       
     2 The appellants have appealed to this Court from that decision, seeking to have overturned his Honour’s rejection of their principal allegation of negligence and seeking also very much increased damages. 
      
       
        
       CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
     3 Since December 1992, the appellants have been owners as tenants in common in equal shares of a parcel of land of about 6 hectares at Blackhill near Newcastle. This land is within the local government area of the respondent Council, and is zoned in the Newcastle Local Environment Plan 1978 as Rural 1(a).  
      
       
     4 On 4 August 1993, at a time when there was already one residence on the property, the appellant Jason Tynan (who I will refer to as Jason), with the consent of all appellants, lodged a Development Application with the Council seeking consent for a development described as “dual occupancy/manager’s residence”, with a proposed floor space of 47.25m.sq. The accompanying plans showed a small rectangular house built on a number of wooden piers, with the site plan showing the house having its western edge approximately parallel to the western boundary of the land and 12.4 metres from that boundary.  
      
       
     5 The Development Application was approved by the Council on 15 October 1993, subject to conditions including a condition that the proposed development be carried out “strictly in accordance with the details set out in the plans”.  
      
       
     6 Meanwhile, on 19 August 1993, Jason had lodged a building application in respect of the same development, which described the building as a pre-built one-bedroom kit home. Jason subsequently dug pier holes for the house, and on 20 October 1993 contacted the Council requesting an inspection. The Council records noted this as a request for an inspection in relation to “steel/slab”. On 21 October 1993, a Mr. Schasser, an employee of the Council, came to the site; and his notes record that the inspection disclosed pier holes approximately 1.2 metres deep, and that Jason was told “he can erect the poles”. The piers were then concreted in, and on 28 October 1993, by means of a crane, the kit home was placed on the piers. The kit home had been acquired at a cost of $9,000.00.  
      
       
     7 On 1 December 1993, the building application was approved subject to conditions, including a condition requiring compliance in full with all conditions of the development consent. 
      
       
     8 On 12 November 1995, Jason lodged a second building application seeking approval for building work being “alterations/additions to an existing building”. The plans showed substantial extensions, all at a greater distance from the western boundary than 12.4 metres. The site plan showed the western boundary of the property approximately parallel to the western wall of the original house and 12.4 metres from it.  
      
       
     9 The second building application was approved on 21 August 1995. On 14 September 1995, a Council officer, Mr. Kuba, came to the site to inspect before the concrete slab was poured. On that occasion, he was observed by Jason to have a heated discussion with the appellants’ neighbour to the west, Mr. Meharg, following which Mr. Kuba came back and told Jason that the building was in the wrong place, in that the plan showed the house to be 12.4 metres from the boundary whereas in fact it was considerably closer. Mr. Kuba advised Jason to lodge an amended building application.  
      
       
     10 On 24 October 1995, Jason wrote the following letter to the Council: 
      
       
        
         
         In response to your letter regarding my building application please find attached 4 site plans. 
          
          
         The previous plans which were submitted were incorrectly surveyed due to a misunderstanding of the boundry (sic) line. The measurements were taken from a row of surveyor pegs just beyond the fence, which were thought to be the correct boundry (sic) line. 
          
          
         Since this matter has been brought to my attention new plans have been drawn up which I hope meet council requirements. I'm sorry for any inconvience (sic) this misunderstanding may have caused. 
         
        
        
       The plan attached to that letter showed that the western boundary of the land was not parallel with the western wall of the “existing res”, and showed it to be only 3.4 metres from that wall at the northern end of the wall and only 0.987 metres away from the wall at the southern end of the wall.  
        
       
     11 However, it is plain from plans in Blue Appeal Book pp.151-2 and from a photograph in Exhibit G that these measurements were not in fact from the western wall of the original kit house, but from the posts of a covered area which were about 2.4 metres to the west of the western wall of the original kit home. Accordingly, the boundary was in fact about 5.8 metres from the western wall of the original kit house at the northern end of that wall, and about 3.4 metres from the western wall at the southern end of that wall. 
      
       
     12 On 9 November 1995, Jason lodged amendments to both building applications, showing the house in the correct location. These amendments were approved on 6 February 1996, and construction of the house was completed.  
      
       
     13 Later in 1996, Mr. Meharg sued the appellants and the Council in the Land & Environment Court, seeking orders for removal of the building. On 13 February 1998, Sheahan J declared the two building approvals and the approval to the amendment to be invalid, declared that the building was unlawful, and ordered its removal. He ordered the appellants and the council each to pay one-half of Mr. Meharg’s costs of those proceedings.  
      
       
     14 The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal from that decision. On 30 September 1998, the Court of Appeal gave its decision, overturning Sheahan J’s decision in relation to the two building approvals, but confirming it in relation to the approval of the amendments, and otherwise dismissing the appeal. The basis of the Court of Appeal decision was that it was not reasonably open to the Council to conclude that the approval as amended (for a building located close to the boundary) would be substantially the same as the original approval (for a building located 12.4 metres from the boundary), as required by s.106 of the Local Government Act. The Court of Appeal ordered the appellants to pay Mr. Meharg’s costs of the appeal.  
      
       
     15 At first, the appellants did not comply with the order to remove the house, and contempt proceedings were brought in the Court of Appeal. The house was removed on 6 March 1999. In August 1999, the appellants commenced these proceedings against the Council.  
      
       
     16 In the proceedings below, the appellants alleged in substance two areas of breach of duty by the Council: firstly, negligence associated with the 1993 inspection by Mr. Schasser, and secondly, negligence associated with the 1995-6 approvals. The appellants claimed the following heads of damage: 
      
       
       1. 1993 expenses incurred for the kit home: $15,160.00 
        
       2. 1995 materials and labouring erecting extensions: $29,109.80 
        
       3. 1996 materials and builder for extensions: $14,218.40 
        
       4. Removal of dwelling 1999: $11,173.00 
        
       5. Fees/costs for replacing dwelling: $2,462.00 
        
       6. Expert advice: $153,272.00 (This claim was amended before us to a claim for $105,118.50 actually paid to the expert Mr. McNaughton) 
        
       7. Legal costs expended in relation to Land & Environment Court proceedings: $175,317.10 
        
       8. Rent costs: $8,115.00 
        
       9. Purchase of steel beams supporting home: $2,700.00. 
        
        
       DECISION OF PRIMARY JUDGE 
       
     17 The primary judge found that it was not within Mr. Schasser’s functions when he made the inspection on 21 October 1993 to measure the distance of the piers from the boundary, or to ascertain the whereabouts of the boundary. Accordingly, his Honour found that there was no breach by the Council in Mr. Schasser not doing so, or in him not advising Jason to submit a new plan or to stop work.  
      
       
     18 However, the primary judge found that the Council through Mr. Kuba did encourage Jason in late October 1995 to make an amended application, and thereby breached a duty of care causing damage to the appellants.  
      
       
     19 The primary judge said that, if he had found for the appellants on the 1993 alleged breach, he would have deducted 50% for contributory negligence; but he found no contributory negligence by the appellants in relation to the 1995 breach.  
      
       
     20 The primary judge then went on to consider damages on two alternative bases: first, what he called scenario 1, namely that the Council was liable for the alleged 1993 negligence as well as the 1995 negligence; and second, what he called scenario 2, namely that the Council was liable only for the 1995 negligence.  
      
       
     21 Dealing in turn with the nine heads of damage, his Honour’s conclusions were as follows: 
      
       
       1. The appellants’ counsel conceded that Jason still proposed to use the kit home, and the primary judge indicated that he would have awarded $6,000.00 on scenario 1, but nothing on scenario 2.  
        
       2. The respondent’s counsel contended that many materials could be re-used, and the primary judge indicated he would have awarded $15,000.00 on scenario 1, but nothing on scenario 2. 
        
       3. The primary judge found that some of the items under this head could be re-used, and assessed damages under this head at $12,000.00 on both scenarios. 
        
       4. On scenario 1, the primary judge would have awarded the whole amount claimed for removal of the house, namely $11,173.00; but on scenario 2, he allowed only an incremental amount of $2,000.00. 
        
       5. The primary judge found that nothing was payable under this head on either scenario. 
        
       6. The primary judge held that it was reasonable for the appellants to have retained the expert Mr. McNaughton, but not reasonable for them not to have placed a limit on this expense, namely a limit of $30,000.00. His Honour would have awarded $30,000 on scenario 1, but awarded $4,000.00 on scenario 2.  
        
       7. In relation to costs, the primary judge rejected a res judicata argument advanced by the respondent. However, in so far as the costs claimed were costs of Mr. Meharg ordered to be paid by the appellants, the primary judge held that any award in relation to these costs would be re-visiting the very question determined in the previous proceedings. That finding accounted for about $107,000.00 of the appellants’ claim. As regards the appellants’ own costs, about $68,000.00, recovery of those costs from the Council had not been considered in the previous proceedings, and the primary judge said he would have awarded $40,000.00 on scenario 1. However, he found that “even without the breach of duty involved in scenario 2, the proceedings would have been brought in the Land & Environment Court and would have gone on appeal”. Accordingly, he awarded only $2,000.00 on scenario 2, being the amount by which he considered the costs had been increased by the scenario 2 breach. 
        
       8. The primary judge would have allowed rent costs of $8,115.00 on scenario 1, but allowed none on scenario 2. 
        
       9. There being no evidence that the beams were worthless, the primary judge would have allowed $1,500.00 under this head on scenario 1. He allowed none on scenario 2. 
        
       
     22 In the result, his Honour awarded damages of $20,000.00 plus interest from 9 November 1995.  
      
       
        
       GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
     23 The appellants appealed on the following grounds: 
      
       
        
         
         1. His Honour was in error in stating (at page 5, paragraph 10) that the Appellant's case was that the Respondent was negligent by failing to measure the distance of the Kit-Home or alterations from the western boundary before giving its approval in 1993 and 1995; 
          
          
         2. His Honour ought to have stated that the case pleaded and contended for by the Appellants was that the duty of care owed by the Respondent in 1993 to the Appellants when Mr Schasser inspected the pier holes was that in the performance of its statutory duties to ensure that the distance between the western boundary and the position where the kit-home was to be erected, was in conformity with the distance disclosed in the plan lodged with the approved development application. 
          
          
         3. His Honour failed to provide reasons as to why clause 12 of the Local Government (Approvals) Regulation 1993 did not provide him with any assistance for determining of the existence of a duty of care at the time when Schasser approved the pier holes and authorised the pouring of cement. 
          
          
         4. His Honour ought to have found:- 
          
         (a) that when Schasser was at the site in 1993 to inspect the pier holes he was participating in or part of the approval process for the Respondent in respect of the erection of the kit-home to which process clause 12(g) of the above Regulations applied; and 
          
         (b) that the Respondent owed to the Appellants a duty of care to ensure that before it approved the Building Application (BA93/23118) that the position for the kit-home (as disclosed by the pier holes) in relation to the western boundary was in conformity with the plan which formed part of the approved development application. 
          
          
         5. His Honour erred in finding (at pages 10 to 11 paragraphs 20 and page 12 paragraph 22(e)) that:- 
          
         (a) Mr Schasser did not have to locate the western boundary; or 
          
         (b) to observe the discrepancy between the position of the pier holes and that boundary on his inspection, and the distance thereof recorded in the plan attached or forming part of the approved development application; or 
          
         (c) that it was not within the bounds of Schassers function that day, to ascertain the position of the western boundary or to advise the Appellants of a discrepancy between the position of the kit home disclosed in the plan and the western boundary; 
          
         (d) that the western boundary was approximately half a metre closer to the kit home than the boundary; 
          
         (e) Schasser found the fence `quite some distance from the pier holes'; and 
          
         (f) by failing to find that the failure of the Respondent to call Schasser to provide evidence of his inspection of the pier holes in 1993 permitted an inference that the Respondent thereby would have exposed facts unfavourable to its case (Jones v Dunkell 1959 101CLR 298 @ 320) and consequentially to draw an inference that his evidence would not have assisted the Respondent's case; and 
          
         (g) that the Appellant was in a better position than anyone to observe or to deduce the error; and 
          
         (h) by finding (at page 13 paragraph 22(h)) that ""no conduct or failure to act on the Repsondent's (sic) part induced the Appellant (Jason Tynan) not to take steps to protect himself from the error in the plan, or that he (Jason) was relying upon the Respondent to point out errors in the plan”; and 
          
         (i) that the Respondent did not owe a duty of care. 
          
          
         6. As to His Honour's findings on contributory negligence His Honour was in error In finding: 
          
         (a) that there was a causal relationship between the failure of the Appellant (Jason Tynan) to observe the measurement of 12.5m on the plan and the omission of Schasser to properly carry out his statutory function; and 
          
         (b) by making the finding of contributory negligence in paragraph 31 His Honour ought to have (but failed) to find that the Respondent (through Schasser) was negligent. 
          
          
         7. His Honour ought to have found that there was no evidence upon which to find contributory negligence in respect of Scenario 1. 
          
          
         8. As to damages His Honour erred as follows:- 
          
         (a) by failing to award $6000 for compensation for the loss in respect of the cost of the acquisition and erection of the kit-home; 
          
         (b) by failing to award the sum of $15,000 as compensation for the loss suffered in respect of the extensions (page 16 paragraph 35); 
          
         (c) by failing to award the sum of $11,173 (paragraph 36(d); and 
          
         (d) in the finding in paragraph 37 that most of those expenses would have been incurred in any event; and 
          
         (e) by failing to award the fees (in paragraph 37(e)) lost for the fees for the development and building applications; and 
          
         (f) His Honour was in error by imposing the limit of $30,000 in respect of the fees paid to McNaughton and by the award of $4000 as compensation for the cost for retaining him as an expert; and 
          
         (g) that the claim for the legal costs in respect of the Land & Environment Court was an attempt to re-visit the order made by Justice Sheahan; and 
          
         (h) His Honour's finding (page 21 paragraph 44 and page 22) that even without the 1995 breach of duty proceedings would have been brought in the Land & Environment Court and that the bulk of those fees and in respect of the appeal to the Court of Appeal would have been incurred in any event; 
          
         (i) in failing to find that the rent for alternative accommodation was causally related to the Respondents breach of its duty of care; 
          
         (j) His honour ought to have allowed as damages to cost of the purchase of the steel beams. 
          
          
         9. His Honour ought to have awarded as damages in addition to those claimed in 8 above:- 
          
         (a) the sum of $173,317.10 for the legal costs in respect of the Land & Environment Court proceedings; 
          
         (b) the sum of $153,272 for the fees paid to Mr McNaughton. 
         
        
        
       ISSUES 
       
     24 The issues argued on appeal essentially came down to the following. Firstly, whether the primary judge was in error in not finding a breach of duty by the Council in 1993. Secondly, an issue which would arise only if there was a decision in favour of the appellants on the first issue, namely what damages should be awarded on the basis of that breach. Thirdly, the question whether or not there was error in assessment of damages for the 1995 breach. That in turn led to two subsidiary issues: firstly, the question of res judicata affecting the claim for costs, and secondly the question whether there was error in the primary judge’s finding that the Land & Environment Court proceedings and appeal would have happened even if the 1995 breach had not occurred.  
      
       
        
       1993 BREACH 
       
     25 The appellants’ submissions on this matter relied inter alia on cl.12(1)(g) of the Local Government (Approvals) Regulation 1993. Clause 12(1) of that Regulation is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         12(1) In determining an application for approval to erect a building the council must take the following matters into consideration: 
          
         (a) drainage, ventilation, lighting and healthiness of the building, 
          
         (b) design, materials, stability, building line and height, 
          
         (c) size, height and lighting of rooms, 
          
         (d) height of floor levels in relation to level of road, 
          
         (e) size, height and materials of party walls between buildings, 
          
         (f) the proportion of the site to be covered by the building and the provision of open spaces and light areas, 
          
         (g) the position of the building or any outbuilding or office in relation to other buildings or to the boundaries of the site, 
          
         (h) the provision of storage for water for domestic purposes, 
          
         (i) means of access generally and particularly the means of access for the purposes of the removal of human waste and other waste, whether a public place may be obstructed or rendered inconvenient if the approval is given, 
          
         (k) height, materials, stability, design and position of fences (if any) to be erected on or on the boundaries of the allotment on which the building is to be erected, 
          
         (l) whether the site is subject to flooding or tidal inundation, 
          
         (m) whether the site is or probably will be subject to subsidence or slip, 
          
         (n) whether the erection of the building adversely affects the drainage of adjoining sites, 
          
         (o) whether the use of the building is likely to cause offensive noise within the meaning of the Noise Control Act 1975, 
          
         (p) the likely effect of the building on other land and buildings, 
          
         (q) if the land is not or will not be connected to a public sewerage system, whether the site is suitable for the satisfactory disposal of effluent from, and an adequate water supply is or can be made available for, a septic tank, or if not, a septic closet or, if not, another means of disposing of human waste. 
         
        
       
     26 The essential submission of Mr. Van Aalst, Counsel for the appellants, was that, having regard to cl.12(1)(g), there was an obligation on Mr. Schasser, when he came to the site, to observe where the piers were in relation to the boundary and satisfy himself that there appeared to be compliance with the plans. Even a cursory observation of the position of the pier holes relative to the western fence line of the boundary would have made it obvious to him that they were far closer than 12.4 metres to the boundary. Mr. Van Aalst also submitted that the primary judge’s reasons were inadequate, because he gave no reasons for saying that cl.1(g) “did not assist” him.  
      
       
     27 In my opinion, although the inspection by Mr. Schasser took place before approval of the building application, it is plain that it was not part of the process of approval of a building application. It is plain that Jason was wishing to proceed urgently with the building in anticipation of approval of the building application, and what he had requested from the Council was an inspection required prior to the installation of the poles on which the kit home was to be placed, an inspection which would normally take place after approval of the building application. I have already referred to the fact that the note of the request indicated that the inspection was to be of “steel/slab”.  
      
       
     28 The matters referred to in cl.12(1)(g) are matters for consideration prior to the granting of a building application, and accordingly are matters which the clause contemplates will be considered before any building work commences; so the consideration of the matters in cl.12(1)(g) must be based on the plans and specifications submitted to the Council and the Council’s appreciation of the site prior to the commencement of any building work. In my opinion, the primary judge was plainly correct to say that cl.12(1)(g) had no relevance to the inspection carried out by Mr. Schasser, and there was no deficiency of reasons in his judgment on that matter.  
      
       
     29 Since the inspection requested was to approve the preparations for installation of the poles, and since that was the purpose of Mr. Schasser’s visit to the site, there was clearly in my opinion no obligation on Mr. Schasser to check the location of the poles in relation to the boundary of the site. Accordingly, in my opinion, there was no breach of duty by Mr. Schasser or by the Council in Mr. Schasser’s failure to check the distance of the piers from the boundary and failure to alert Jason to the discrepancy with the plans.  
      
       
     30 If Mr. Schasser had actually known that the piers were not placed in accordance with the plans but said nothing, it is possible that that could have amounted to a breach of duty: but no allegation of actual knowledge by Mr. Schasser was ever made. Furthermore, an inference of actual knowledge could not have been supported unless there was clear evidence as to the precise physical set-up at the time of the inspection, including the exact location and appearance of any boundary fence. Although there is some evidence that a boundary fence was on the boundary, there is also evidence that it was not. The photograph Exhibit C1 shows a fence and a number of posts in the vicinity of the newly erected kit home which were plainly not on the boundary. One of the plans submitted in July 1995 showed a “boundary fence” parallel to the western wall of the original house and at a distance which, according to the scale on the plan, was about 5.5 metres. In fact, it appears that the boundary was about 5.8 metres from one end of the western wall, and about 3.4 metres from the other end. Jason’s letter of 24 October 1995 also attests to confusion as to the relationship between the existing boundary fence and the boundary. So plainly, in the absence of any obligation to check, no breach of duty could be made out on the way the case was conducted and on the evidence.  
      
       
     31 Accordingly, no error is shown in relation to the finding that there was no breach of duty in 1993, and there is no need to further look at damages on scenario 1.  
      
       
        
       SCENARIO 2 DAMAGES 
       
     32 Apart from the particular questions concerning res judicata and findings concerning whether court proceedings would have occurred but for the scenario 2 breach, the attack on the damages findings were essentially on the basis that the primary judge was not justified in the reductions he made to the appellants’ claims for expenses on the building, and that the primary judge was not justified in putting a limit of $30,000.00 on the amount claimed for the appellants’ expert, and of $40,000.00 on the amount claimed for costs.  
      
       
     33 In my opinion, these submissions have no substance. Although the appellants put into evidence invoices supporting payments of the amounts which they claimed, they did not give any evidence which established precisely when different items were delivered and used in the building or what items were still of value to the appellants. In the absence of such evidence from the appellants, the primary judge could only do his best on inadequate material, and there is no basis for saying that he has not reasonably done that.  
      
       
     34 As regards the limit of $30,000.00 placed on the expert’s fees, it should be noticed first of all that most of these fees were incurred after the Court of Appeal decision, at a time when the appellants were under an unconditional obligation to remove the building. The Council cannot be liable for expenses unreasonably incurred by the appellants, and in my opinion the primary judge was certainly entitled to conclude that anything more than $30,000.00 spent on this expert would be unreasonable, having regard to the matters at issue and the stage that the resolution of the problem had reached.  
      
       
     35 As regards the figure of $40,000.00 for costs, the reduction from $68,000.00 paid for the appellants’ own costs was justified, because that $68,000.00 included costs incurred in relation to the contempt proceedings, for which the Council could not be liable; and the primary judge was not given any material to assist him in determining how much of those costs was attributable to the contempt proceedings or was otherwise unreasonable.  
      
       
        
       RES JUDICATA 
       
     36 On this matter, the Council originally filed a Notice of Contention, relying on the following grounds: 
      
       
        
         
         The Respondent gives notice (pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules 1970 Part 51 rule 21) that it contends that the decision of the Court below (relating to the grounds of appeal referred to in paragraphs 8(g) and 8(h) of the Notice of Appeal filed by the Appellants on15 November 2001) should be affirmed on the following grounds: 
          
         1. The Trial Judge erred in not determining (in paragraphs 42-44 of his Reasons for Judgment published on 19 October 2001) that the Appellants were estopped from asserting claims for legal costs for the proceedings in and on appeal from the Land and Environment Court of NSW. 
          
          
         2. The Appellants' claims for legal costs for the proceedings in and on appeal from the Land and Environment Court are the subject of an estoppel operative against the Appellants or (in accordance with the principles enunciated in Reichel v Magrath (1889) 14 App Cas 665 at 668 and Haines v ABC (1995) 43 NSWLR 404 at 410B and 414A-D should be dismissed as an abuse of process. 
         
        
       
     37 At the hearing of the appeal, the Council sought leave to put on a cross-appeal, seeking reduction or elimination of damages in respect of costs, relying on the same grounds. The Court gave leave for such a cross-appeal to be filed.  
      
       
     38 It was submitted by Mr. Van Aalst for the appellants that the primary judge was in error in deciding that the question of liability, as between the appellants and the Council, for the costs of Mr. Meharg had been determined in the previous proceedings. On the other hand, Mr. Lindsay SC for the Council submitted that the determination in relation to costs made in the previous proceedings was inconsistent with a finding being made now that the Council should be liable for any of the appellants’ costs of the previous proceedings.  
      
       
     39 In my opinion, the primary judge was correct on both matters.  
      
       
     40 In the previous proceedings, the question was explicitly addressed as to what proportions of Mr. Meharg’s costs should be borne by the appellants and by the Council. It would have been open for the appellants or the Council to have submitted that that question not be determined in those proceedings, but that each be left liable for Mr. Meharg’s costs, with their responsibility inter se to be determined elsewhere. However, that course was not taken. The order that each pay one-half of the costs was in no way provisional or made so as to leave open some subsequent adjustment. The very question at issue having been finally determined in court proceedings, it is not now open for the appellants to seek a different result.  
      
       
     41 On the other hand, there was no question of recovery of the appellants’ own costs from the Council considered in the previous proceedings. The determination of the proportions in which these parties should bear Mr. Meharg’s costs did involve some general assessment of the responsibility of the appellants and the Council for what had happened, but there was never any formulation of the issues dealt with in the present proceedings, namely the questions of existence and breach of duties of care and damages consequent thereon. Those issues never having been formulated and determined, I do not consider that the determination in relation to the other question of costs could give rise to res judicata or issue estoppel in relation to recovery from the Council of the appellants’ own costs. Nor in my opinion could a claim for those costs be considered an abuse of process: that claim was more appropriately dealt with in the present proceedings than in the previous proceedings. 
      
       
        
       WHETHER PROCEEDINGS WOULD HAVE OCCURRED IN THE ABSENCE OF THE 1995 BREACH 
       
     42 Mr. Van Aalst submitted for the appellants that the primary judge’s finding was plainly wrong, because the evidence was strongly to the effect that Mr. Meharg was upset primarily by the 1995 extensions, and took proceedings only because of those extensions. Mr. Lindsay submitted that there was ample material for the primary judge to make the finding that he did, namely that there would have been Land & Environment Court proceedings and an appeal even if the 1995 breach had not occurred.  
      
       
     43 One very significant piece of evidence concerning this matter is a letter written by Mr. Meharg to the Council on 24 November 1995, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         I thank you for your letter of 22nd November 1995. 
          
          
         I must express my concern at the fact that the Council saw fit to forward me the notice of 22nd November 1995 in respect of the construction of a verandah on the dwelling referred to in Building Application number 95/1371 but did not see fit to notify me of the construction of the original dwelling nor of the extension to that dwelling. Perhaps council could initially advise me as to why notice of the first construction and subsequent extension where not advised to me. 
          
          
         I hereby give notice that I object to the proposed alteration and additions referred to in the Building Application. 
          
          
         It has come to my attention that the original application for construction of a dwelling required that a relocatable kit home be constructed on the site and that the dwelling be some 12.4 metres from the common boundary. I note that neither of those two conditions have been complied with. Indeed a recent survey carried out by a qualified Surveyor shows that the guttering for the proposed verandah will be only .64 metres from the actual common boundary. between the registered proprietor of the property in respect of which the building application has been lodged and my property. It is also apparent that the actual original dwelling is not the required 12.4 metres from the common boundary. These matters appear to have been overlooked by the council in respect of the dwelling. 
          
          
         The construction of the dwelling impedes my access to a view which was a prime consideration in my decision to select a site on my property for the construction of my own dwelling. I propose that my own dwelling shall be constructed approximately opposite the dwelling which has been constructed and which is the subject of the building application. Accordingly further extension of that property will impede upon the privacy of my property and will severely restrict the view available from my property. It is quite apparent that the original approval of a development application in respect of the construction of the dwelling which is now sought to be extended has not been complied with in that the purposes for which the dwelling was to be constructed in accordance with the development application also the residence was to be a ""managers residence"". 
          
          
         I object most strongly against the construction of the further improvements as sought in the building application and deserve (sic) my rights to pursue this matter further should Council approve the further extensions. 
         
        
       
     44 Mr. Van Aalst pointed particularly to the last paragraph of that letter as indicating that it was the further improvements to which Mr. Meharg objected, and to the indication that he would pursue the matter further should the Council approve the further extensions, thus implying that otherwise he would not. On the other hand, Mr. Lindsay pointed to the circumstance that the lack of previous objection to the original building is explained by the circumstance referred to in the fourth paragraph of the letter that it was only shortly before the letter that Mr. Meharg became aware that the original building was not in accordance with the approved plan; and Mr. Lindsay pointed to the indication in the next paragraph that even the construction of the original dwelling impeded a view which was a prime consideration of Mr. Meharg’s decision as to the site for construction of his own dwelling.  
      
       
     45 In my opinion, as raised with counsel at the hearing of the matter, there is a more fundamental problem with the approach of the primary judge. The question of whether proceedings would have been brought in any event, even if the 1995 breach had not occurred, is a hypothetical question, and in my opinion the principles laid down in Malec v. J.C. Hutton Pty. Limited (1990) 169 CLR 638 at 642-3 indicate that it was not a matter for definite decision one way or another as to whether this event would have occurred. The relevant passage from Malec is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         When liability has been established and a common law court has to assess damages, its approach to events that allegedly would have occurred, but cannot now occur, or that allegedly might occur, is different from its approach to events which allegedly have occurred. A common law court determines on the balance of probabilities whether an event has occurred. If the probability of the event having occurred is greater than it not having occurred, the occurrence of the event is treated as certain; if the probability of it having occurred is less than it not having occurred, it is treated as not having occurred. Hence, in respect of events which have or have not occurred, damages are assessed on an all or nothing approach. But in the case of an event which it is alleged would or would not have occurred, or might or might not yet occur, the approach of the court is different. The future may be predicted and the hypothetical may be conjectured. But questions as to the future or hypothetical effect of physical injury or degeneration are not commonly susceptible of scientific demonstration or proof. If the law is to take account of future or hypothetical events in assessing damages, it can only do so in terms of the degree of probability of those events occurring. The probability may be very high - 99.9 per cent - or very low - 0.1 per cent. But unless the chance is so low as to be regarded as speculative - say less than 1 per cent - or so high as to be practically certain - say over 99 per cent - the court will take that chance into account in assessing the damages. Where proof is necessarily unattainable, it would be unfair to treat as certain a prediction which has a 51 per cent probability of occurring, but to ignore altogether a prediction which has a 49 per cent probability of occurring. Thus, the court assesses the degree of probability that an event would have occurred, or might occur, and adjusts its award of damages to reflect the degree of probability.  
         
        
       
     46 Mr. Van Aalst frankly conceded that this proposition was not put to the primary judge, and Mr. Lindsay submitted that accordingly this Court could not give effect to it. 
      
       
     47 However, in my opinion it was an error for the primary judge to find as a matter of fact that, even without the 1995 breach of duty, the Land & Environment Court proceedings and appeal would definitely have occurred, and to assess damages on that basis. That error is challenged in ground 8(h) of the Grounds of Appeal. In my opinion, this Court should give effect to that ground of appeal and correct the error, apply the correct principle, and avoid so far as possible any injustice to the Council arising from the circumstance that this submission was not put below.  
      
       
     48 In my opinion, having regard to the competing contentions to which I have referred, based on Mr. Meharg’s letter of 24 November 1995, and having support also from other parts of the evidence, there is an appreciable chance that, if the Council had not committed its 1995 breach, the Land & Environment Court proceedings would have been avoided. There is a chance that Mr. Meharg would not have felt sufficiently strongly about the initial small construction to take proceedings. There is a chance that, if all that had been erected was the original small house, the appellants would have acceded to a demand to remove it. There is a chance that, if given correct advice, the appellants may have been able to obtain a development approval and building approval such as would have at least given the appellants a satisfactory alternative to the complete removal of the structure. There is even a very small chance that, assuming proceedings were taken, the discretion of the court may have been exercised differently if it was only the original structure which was in place. In my opinion, consistently with Malec, the appellants should in substance have been compensated for being deprived of these chances. 
      
       
     49 In my opinion, when one takes into account all the contingencies, and also has regard to the disadvantage that may flow to the Council through this matter not being properly ventilated below, the appropriate course is to substitute, for the figures adopted by the primary judge, a figure of one-half of the $30,000.00 of the expert’s fees and one-half of the $40,000.00 legal costs, totalling $35,000.00. The primary judge adopted $4,000.00 and $2,000.00 respectively, and accordingly there will be an increase in the verdict of $29,000.00. In my opinion, it would be fair to award interest on that increase from the date of the Court of Appeal decision, that is 30 September 1998. In arriving at this figure, I have taken into account the possible impact of the contingencies in relation to other heads of damage, as well as the one immediately under consideration. 
      
       
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     50 Accordingly, the orders which I propose are as follows: 
      
       
       1. Appeal allowed to the extent of increasing the judgment in favour of the appellants by a sum of $29,000.00 plus interest on that amount from 30 September 1998. 
        
       2. Appeal otherwise dismissed. 
        
       3. No order as to the costs of the appeal.  
        
       
     51 In my opinion, the last order is appropriate, having regard to the limited success of the appeal, and the circumstance that it has succeeded on the basis of a principle not put below and not put to this Court until raised by this Court. The same considerations also mean that the costs order below should not be altered. 
      
       
     52 DAVIES AJA: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
      
       
     53 PEARLMAN AJA: I agree with Hodgson JA.

      MACKO V. COMMONWEALTH SECURITIES LIMITED 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: On 8 August 2001, Brownie AJ gave judgment that the appellant, Victor Macko, pay the respondent, Commonwealth Securities Ltd, the sum of $869,282.09, and also pay the respondent's costs of the proceedings. The appellant appeals to this Court from that decision. 
      
       
     2 I will begin with an outline of the circumstances. The respondent is a subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia which provides share broking services. From some time prior to February 1998 the appellant had been a client of the respondent. From about February 1998 an employee of the respondent, Amanda Alexander, who was then a client advisor, became the appellant's main advisor. 
      
       
     3 On 14 April 2000, the appellant became sole director and secretary of a company which, on 17 April 2000, took the name Deutsche Securities Proprietary Limited. I will refer to that company as DS. It appears that by about this time, the appellant and his wife were the sole shareholders of that company. 
      
       
     4 During June 2000, on the appellant's application, the respondent opened thirty-five share trading accounts in the name of DS, each account being given an additional identification at the request of the appellant. The appellant told Ms Alexander that he was director of DS and had DS's authority to give instructions to the respondent. 
      
       
     5 On 3 August 2000, the appellant ceased to be director and secretary of DS, and one Jane Corin became sole director and secretary in his place. This change was in fact processed by ASIC on 7 August 2000. From that time, that is 3 August 2000, the appellant no longer had any actual authority to give instructions or otherwise act on behalf of DS. 
      
       
     6 During August 2000, on instructions given by the appellant to Ms Alexander, the respondent purchased and sold some parcels of shares in NRMA Insurance Group Limited, purportedly on behalf of DS. On 9 August, 1 million such shares were purchased for $2,888,166.06. On 10 August, 266,000 shares were purchased for $796,053.10. On 15 August, a million shares were sold for $2,995,470. On 17 August, 1.1 million shares were purchased for $3,386,057.72. On 18 August, 1.2 million shares were purchased for $3,563,513.94. At no time during these transactions did the appellant inform Ms Alexander or the respondent that he had ceased to have actual authority to act on behalf of DS, or that he had ceased to be a director of DS. 
      
       
     7 When the time for settlement of the relevant purchases arrived, neither the appellant nor DS provided the respondent with the money for the purchases. The respondent subsequently sold the shares at a loss of about $800,000, and it was that sum, together with interest, that made up the amount of the judgment that was given below. 
      
       
     8 The respondent first claimed this loss from DS. DS did not pay and went into liquidation with no assets. The respondent then sued the appellant. The claim originally included claims on the basis of breach of warranty of authority and negligent misstatement, but these claims were not pressed. What were pressed were claims for deceit and for breaches of sections 42 and 44 of the Fair Trading Act and equivalent sections of the Trade Practices Act. 
      
       
     9 Brownie AJ made the following findings. First, that the appellant knew he lacked actual authority to give the instructions that he gave to the respondent between 9 and 18 August 2000. Secondly, that the circumstances called for the appellant to disclose to the respondent that he lacked actual authority and had ceased to be a director of DS. Thirdly, that his failure to do so amounted to deceptive and misleading conduct within section 42 of the Fair Trading Act and also a false representation within section 44 of the Fair Trading Act. Fourthly, his Honour accepted the evidence of Ms Alexander that if she had been told either that the appellant had ceased to be a director of DS or that he had ceased to have actual authority to give instructions, she would not have accepted the instructions to buy the shares. In doing so, his Honour accepted that, from the perspective of the respondent and Ms Alexander, what was important was the relationship between the appellant and DS as it appeared to the respondent, and that Ms Alexander gave DS credit because it treated DS as being in substance the appellant's company. Finally, his Honour found that the respondent's loss of around $800,000 was caused by the appellant's deceit and breaches of the Fair Trading Act and Trade Practices Act. 
      
       
     10 The appellant relies on the following grounds of appeal. 
      
       
        
         
         1 His Honour ought to have expressly found (if he did not): 
          
         a. that the appellant acted with the apparent authority of Deutsche Securities on 9, 17 and 18 August; 
          
         b. that the respondent entered into the share purchase transactions on the faith of that apparent authority; and 
          
         c. accordingly, that the respondent obtained from those dates, by operation of law, binding and enforceable contracts with Deutsche Securities. 
          
          
         2. His Honour ought to have held that the appellant's conduct between 3 and 18 August 2000 did not amount to misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) or s52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (or analogous sections) or to tortious deceit in circumstances where, by operation of law under the doctrine of apparent authority, the respondent obtained, immediately upon accepting the appellant's instructions for the purchase of shares on behalf of Deutsche Securities, binding contracts with Deutsche Securities. 
          
          
         3. Alternatively to the above, His Honour erred in holding that the respondent had suffered damage as a result of the conduct of the appellant. 
          
          
         4. His Honour erred in holding that any false representations made by, or tortuous conduct of, the appellant between 3 and 18 August 2000 in respect of any affiliation on his part with Deutsche Securities Pty Ltd (""Deutsche Securities"") caused the respondent to suffer loss on 8 September 2000. 
          
          
         5. His Honour erred in holding that the respondent had suffered any damage sufficient to constitute a claim in deceit against the appellant or to entitle the respondent to damages pursuant to s82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) or s68 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW). 
          
          
         6. His Honour ought to have found that the reliance evidence summarized at paragraph 25 of his Honour's Judgment dated 8 August 2001 did not in terms amount to a sufficient nexus between the appellant's conduct and the respondent's loss in the circumstances of the case. 
          
          
         7. His Honour erred in holding the appellant liable to the respondent liable for damages in respect of loss that the respondent would have suffered even if the appellant's representation to the respondent to the effect that he continued to hold a relevant authority from Deutsche Securities had been correct. 
          
          
         8. His Honour erred in awarding to the respondent damages in excess of any damages recoverable by the respondent in contract for breach of warranty of authority. 
         
        
       
     11 The issues argued on appeal come down in substance to two issues: firstly, was there a material misrepresentation and secondly, if so, was it causative of the loss.  
      
       
     12 Dealing first with the former of those questions, Mr Gleeson SC, for the appellant, submitted that the primary judge found, or should have found, that the appellant had ostensible authority to bind DS, and accordingly there was no material misrepresentation. He submitted that where there was a representation of authority, and the representor in fact had ostensible authority, then there was no breach of any warranty of authority; and he referred to Rainbow v Hawkins [1904] 2 KB 332 at 326 and V/Orasnoimport v Guthrie and Co Ltd [1996] Lloyds LR 1. He submitted that there could be no material misrepresentation so as to base a claim of fraud or misleading conduct where the respondent had obtained what was desired, namely, a contract binding on DS. 
      
       
     13 It is possible that there could be a question as to ostensible authority, having regard to the processing of the change by ASIC on 7 August 2000; but even on the assumption that there was ostensible authority, in my opinion, these submissions should be rejected. Even if the appellant had authority to bind DS, that does not, in my view, mean that there was no material misrepresentation. 
      
       
     14 The respondent was dealing with the appellant as a long-standing client, claiming to be a director of DS on behalf of which it was giving instructions. In those circumstances, as the primary judge found, the willingness of the respondent to give credit to DS for many millions of dollars was plainly related to the perceived association of the appellant with DS, the entity in whose name the transactions were being effected. In my opinion, it made a very substantial difference to the position that the appellant no longer had that association with DS, and in fact, on the evidence of Ms Corin, which, according to the primary judge, was uncontradicted and to a large extent unchallenged, had arranged with the new director and secretary of DS that he would not enter into transactions on behalf of DS. Thus the truth, which was concealed from the respondent, was not merely that the appellant no longer had actual authority, but also that he did not have the association with DS that he represented himself as having, and was dishonestly purporting to have an actual authority which he did not have and which was contrary to express arrangements made with the person now having authority to control DS. 
      
       
     15 Mr Gleeson did make a submission that the matters I have outlined were outside the pleadings. In my opinion, the allegations in the pleadings that the appellant had previously informed the respondent that he was director and failed to inform the respondent that he was no longer director, and that the conduct amounted to a false representation by the appellant that he had an affiliation with DS that he did not have, adequately covered the matters which I have referred to. 
      
       
     16 Turning to the next question, whether the misrepresentation was causative of the loss, Mr Gleeson submitted that at most, the respondent was induced to acquire NRMA shares and enter into transactions with DS. As with regard to the former, he submitted that the measure of damages was the difference between the amount paid and the true value of the shares at the date of acquisition: see Potts v Miller (1940) 64 CLR 282, Morgan Corporate Ltd v GWG Leviney Pty. Limited (1995) ATPR 41-414. He submitted that the “but for” test was necessary but not sufficient for establishing damages: see Chappel v Hart (1998) 195 CLR 232, Kenny and Good Pty. Limited v MGICA (1992) Ltd. (1999) 199 CLR 413 at [118]. 
      
       
     17 As to the latter aspect, the entry into transactions with DS, Mr Gleeson submitted that the respondent obtained a contract with DS, as it believed it would, and in any event the loss was caused by the falling value of the shares and the inability of DS to pay, neither of which were related to the misrepresentation. No claim was made that the appellant misled the respondent as to the credit-worthiness of DS. He submitted that the respondent would have suffered the same loss as it did if the information had been correct, ie, if the appellant had been the director of DS, with actual authority to commit it to transactions, and accordingly any damages were too remote. The loss actually suffered was not due to the appellant's conduct but the respondent's preparedness to give DS credit, and market changes: see Doyle v Olby Ltd [1969] 2 QB 158 and Archer v Brown [1985] 1 QB 481. 
      
       
     18 Dealing with the submission based on Potts v Miller, this was not a case where the respondent was acquiring shares on its own behalf. Although the respondent was liable under its contract for the purchase of shares to the vendors of those shares, it is clear from the evidence that was given that it was not contemplated by anyone that these shares were being acquired by the respondent on its own behalf so that it would become the beneficial owner of them. In those circumstances, in my opinion, Potts v Miller has little relevance. 
      
       
     19 As noted earlier, the falsity of the representations by the appellant did not merely relate to the question of authority: the truth that was concealed was that the appellant was not a director of DS having a close relationship with it, as it appeared to the respondent, but was purporting to have a relationship which he did not have. Those matters, in my opinion, were plainly relevant to the question whether the respondent, at the appellant's request, should give many millions of dollars credit to DS. The primary judge accepted Ms Alexander's evidence that, had she known the true position concerning directorship, she would not have given that credit. The “but for” test was thereby plainly satisfied. 
      
       
     20 As far as remoteness is concerned, it seems to me plain that the matters concealed were relevant to the question of whether credit should be granted and were relevant to the risks associated with the granting of that credit. It was submitted by Mr Gleeson that no finding to that effect was made by the primary judge, and that the primary judge proceeded purely on a “but for” test. 
      
       
     21 Accepting that that is correct, in my opinion the materiality of these matters to the risk of loss is so plain that it is appropriate for this court to proceed on that basis. In circumstances where the respondent had dealt with the appellant as its client for many years, and gave credit to DS, plainly in part on the basis of that long relationship, any substantial difference in the affiliation between the appellant and DS, particularly one involving dishonesty, was plainly in my view material to the risk involved in advancing credit to DS. In those circumstances, in my opinion, any submission based on remoteness of damage cannot be upheld. 
      
       
     22 For those reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
      
       
     23 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson J and generally with his reasons. I wish to add a few observations of my own. 
      
       
     24 The appellant advanced four basic contentions. The first contention was that on the assumption that, the appellant had ostensible authority to act on behalf of Deutsche Securities, the respondent obtained exactly what it had bargained for and there was no conduct capable of constituting either the tort of deceit or of misleading conduct under the Trade Practices Act and the Fair Trading Act. The second contention was that by reason of the fact that there was no damage suffered, either in terms of deceit ""by"" the misleading conduct under section 82 of the Trade Practices Act and section 68 of the Fair Trading Act, there was no causal relationship between the conduct and the loss. The third contention was that the appellant should not be held liable for loss which the respondent would have suffered in any event, i.e even if the appellant's representations had been true. This was put in different ways, sometimes in terms that the person in the position of appellant should not be a “guarantor”, and other times in terms that a person in such a position should not be an “insurer”. The fourth contention was that the damages recoverable in either tort, or pursuant to the statutory provisions, should not exceed that which would have been recoverable in contract for breach of warranty of authority. 
      
       
     25 Each of these contentions, the last quite expressly, leads to a result equivalent to a contract measure of damages in the circumstances of this particular case. However, it is well-established, and most recently affirmed by the High Court in Henville v Walker (2001) 75 ALJR 1410, that under the statute, and obviously with respect to the tort of deceit, the tort measure of damages, rather than the contract measure of damages applies. 
      
       
     26 It is not material in this context to determine a loss in accordance with what would have been the case if the representations had been true. The focus of attention must be on the change of position of the respondent by reason of the misrepresentation. See in this regard Henville v Walker paragraphs 130 to 133, 153 and 162. In particular, I draw attention to the observation of McHugh J with respect to the statutory cause of action at paragraph 144 where his Honour drew attention to the purpose of the statute to protect consumers. His Honour observed: 
      
       
        
         
         A loss to a consumer from acting on such an inducement will usually be greater than the amount recoverable by treating the representation as a warranty. 
         
        
        
       This proposition is also frequently true with respect to the tort of deceit. 
        
       
     27 In the present case, the trial judge accepted evidence, which was not challenged in cross-examination, that, if the respondent had known, through its relevant officer, that the appellant had ceased to be a director of Deutsche Securities, the respondent would not have entered into the transaction at all. 
      
       
     28 There is no doubt that in many circumstances the simple application of a but for test is not determinative of issues of causation. However, in the present context, there is a significance that can plainly be discerned from the reliance placed on the status of the appellant as a director. This would have encompassed, at the very least, the known liability for insolvent trading of directors, as a matter upon which persons in commerce are entitled to rely. 
      
       
     29 Other considerations, relating to the funds available to the appellant in all of his various capacities and also the commercial relationship established over a long period of time, are matters pertinent to an understanding of the trial judge's application of a but for test with respect to the misrepresentation about the appellant's status as a director. In this regard, in my opinion, his Honour's finding that the respondent would not have entered into this transaction at all, if it had not been for that misrepresentation, is entirely justified. 
      
       
     30 For these reasons, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
      
       
     31 STEIN AJA: I agree with Hodgson J and the additional remarks of the Chief Justice. 
      
       
     32 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the court is the appeal is dismissed with costs.

      R v Anh Tuan LE 
      
      
       
      
      
      
       
     The appellant was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter by a jury on 15 March 2001. The appellant was sentenced to a term of six years imprisonment with a non parole period of four years. He appealed against his conviction and against the severity of the sentence. 
      
       
     The offence with which the appellant was convicted arose from a fight between two groups of people which included the deceased, his brother and the appellant. The deceased was stabbed with a knife. The appellant did not dispute that he was involved in the fight, had taken up a knife during the fight and that he had run away afterwards. The primary issue at the trial was whether the appellant was the person present who had stabbed the deceased. The appellant could not affirm or deny that he stabbed the deceased. 
      
       
     The brother of the deceased was to give evidence at the trial but he left Australia before this could occur. Pursuant to s116 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, two statements made by the brother were read to the jury, with the trial judge warning the jury of the weight to be placed on the statements given that they did not have the advantage of seeing the brother give evidence. In summing up to the jury, his Honour also identified the inconsistencies which arose between the two statements, the feelings of dislike between the brother and the appellant and the appellant's inability to cross examine and challenge the truth of the statements. The counsel for the appellant at trial did not object to the statements being admitted because he believed that they would assist in establishing a claim of self defence. 
      
       
     The Crown called eleven witnesses, but of those witnesses only one gave evidence which connected the appellant and his knife to the stabbing of the victim. On cross examination the witness identified the person who had the knife as the appellant in the dock. His Honour warned the jury of the caution which must be exercised in relation to court or dock identification evidence on the basis that:- the identification evidence was not given by the witness when he was being examined in chief;- evidence was given by the witness about the knife used by the appellant which appeared inconsistent with the wound inflicted on the deceased;- it may have been difficult for the witness to identify the appellant given that the fight occurred rapidly and involved a great deal of activity; and- the identification was made more than twelve months after the events took place. 
      
       
     The evidence of the other Crown witnesses in the area at the time of the stabbing was often incompatible or inconsistent.The principal grounds of appeal were that:- the trial miscarried and the verdict of the jury was unreasonable in all the circumstances;- the trial Judge had dealt inappropriately with the identification evidence and that such evidence should have been rejected or the jury discharged; and- the trial Judge had dealt inappropriately with the statements of the deceased's brother and that the statements should have been withdrawn from the jury's consideration or the jury discharged. 
      
       
     HELD (per Sheller JA, Levine and Simpson JJ concurring):1. M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 establishes the relevant test to be applied by a court of appeal when determining whether to allow an appeal against conviction pursuant to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912; see Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. 
      
       
     2. Had the identification evidence been led by the Crown and had there been no other identification of the appellant as the person who stabbed the accused the trial Judge may have been justified in discharging the jury: R v Saxon (1998) 1 VR 503 at 513. In this case, the evidence was led by counsel for the appellant and the unexpected identification did not entitle the accused to have the answer taken from the jury or the jury discharged. However, a court or dock identification is of little probative value when made by a witness who has no prior knowledge of the accused. 
      
       
     3. The trial Judge's directions to the jury with regard to the identification evidence was appropriate and as such the Court will not intervene. 
      
       
     4. The probative value of the statements of the brother were significantly reduced because of his non-availability for cross examination: see Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297.  R v Medham & Foster (1993) 71 A Crim R 382 establishes that when a judge allows deposition evidence a warning must be given to the jury about the caution to be exercised in relation to that evidence.  
      
       
     5. In this case, the warning given by the trial Judge with regard to the statements of the brother were appropriate. 
      
       
     6. The evidence that identified the appellant as the person who stabbed the deceased was the testimony and dock identification of one witness and the untested statements of the deceased's brother. The identification evidence was of little weight in the circumstances in which it was given; see Davies & Cody v The King (1937) 57 CLR 170. The trial Judge also warned the jury that it would be dangerous for them to convict on the statements of the brother if they stood alone uncorroborated.The appellant had established that the conviction was unreasonable and involved a miscarriage of justice. It should be set aside.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SHELLER JA:  
      
       
        
       Introduction 
        
        
       On 26 February 2001 the appellant, Anh Tuan Le, was arraigned before McClellan J and a jury of twelve on a charge that on 23 February 2000 at Cabramatta he murdered Tuan Quoc Nguyen. He pleaded not guilty. On 15 March 2001 the jury returned with a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The appellant was sentenced to a term of six years imprisonment commencing on 17 March 2000 with a non-parole period of four years commencing on that date. He has appealed against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence. 
        
        
       Factual Background  
        
       
     2 On 23 February 2000 at about 10.30 am or shortly before in Arthur Street, Cabramatta or the near vicinity a fight broke out between two groups of people which included the deceased, Tuan Quoc Nguyen, and his brother, Phat Quoc Nguyen, and the appellant. There were other persons nearby who may or may not have taken part in the fight. At some point during the fight the deceased fell to the ground and police were called. When they arrived the deceased was lying on his back with his head in the lap of a female person. There was blood on his clothing around the upper stomach region. He was white in the face and not breathing properly. On his arrival at Liverpool Hospital he was found to be dead. A medical examination revealed that the only injury was a 1 cm wound in his left anterior chest. A post-mortem revealed a single stab wound on the left side of the front of the chest below the left nipple. The wound in the skin was approximately 2 cms long. Looking at the wound the upper outer corner was rather blunt and the lower corner was rather sharp which suggested that whatever weapon caused the wound would probably have had one sharp side and one blunt side as in a typical knife. The depth of the wound was estimated to be between 10 and 12 cms. A metal pipe was found at the scene and a knife in a garbage bin in a lane way nearby. 
      
       
     3 The appellant gave evidence. He did not dispute that he was in the area at the time of the fight, that he had been involved in an altercation with the deceased’s brother, Phat Nguyen, the previous day and was involved in a fight with the deceased on this particular occasion, that he had taken up and used a knife during the fight and that he had afterwards run away from the scene. The principal issue at the trial was whether the appellant was the person present who had stabbed the deceased. In his evidence he said that he was throughout the whole incident in a state of terror and “flailing” the knife around to keep the people away from him. He gave the following evidence in chief: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. So, is it possible, though not likely, that you actually did stab, cause the deadly wound, to Phat’s brother as far as you are concerned? A. I’m not sure. It is possible that my weapon came in contact with someone but it happened very quickly, so I don’t remember.” 
         
        
       
     4 A knife was tendered and became exhibit 1. The appellant said that that was possibly a knife that Phat had, “It could be similar. It could be bigger than this one. I’m not sure.” Asked in cross-examination: “When the deceased fell down, you were there with a knife?” the appellant responded: “Yes I was there, but I cannot deny or admit that I was responsible.”  
      
       
        
       Witnesses 
        
       
     5 Apart from police officers and doctors, the Crown called eleven witnesses: 
      
       
        
       Randi Obrenovic 
        
       Benjamin Cameron Banks 
        
       Tania Leanne Murrell 
        
       Rebecca Martinez 
        
       Joshua Martinez 
        
       Steven Richard Dobbin 
        
       Guy Gordon Kersake 
        
       Toan Trieu Tu 
        
       Domenico Carzo 
        
       Bernice Lee Bunny 
        
       Gregory Lombardie 
        
       
     6 Of these witnesses, only Mr Banks gave evidence which connected the appellant and his knife to the stabbing of the victim. Bernice Bunny referred to the “main bloke”, taller than any other Asian, about six feet, short black hair and black tracksuit pants, and said: “I saw him actually stab him with a knife.” The Crown reopened its case to lead evidence about the height of the appellant which was said to be 180 cms or 6 feet tall.  
      
       
        
       Phat Nguyen 
        
       
     7 In his opening to the jury the Crown Prosecutor said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Probably the most important witness, as far as the Crown is concerned, is the brother of the deceased, that is Phat Quoc Nguyen. He had known the accused since about September 1999, indeed, at some stage they lived together in the same residence. He will tell you that on the day of the incident he walked into Arthur Street at about 10.30 in the morning. He was in the company of his brother, the deceased, and he saw the accused and another man and they were near a restaurant in Arthur Street. This other man, according to Phat Quoc Nguyen, was the same man who had been in the company of the accused the previous day when there was an incident; in fact this was an incident at an amusement parlour. 
         
        
        
         
         What happened on 23 February was this: The deceased called out to the accused. He said words to this effect, ‘Come, I want to talk’ and the accused responded, he said, ‘Wait there.’ The accused then walked off to a nearby – it looked like a garden bed or some sort of place that had plants there and from there he produced a knife and he produced some cloth. What happened then was that the accused then ran at the deceased and at Phat Quoc Nguyen who were together. Thereafter the accused’s companion dragged the deceased’s brother to the gutter, attacked him there and while that was taking place on the roadway, the accused swung a knife at the deceased. That is the allegation. Following that the deceased ran over to the footpath and then collapsed. The accused yelled out, ‘Run’ and both he and his companion fled the scene. That is the version that is given by the brother of the deceased.” 
         
        
       
     8 On the third day of the trial, Wednesday 28 February 2001, the Crown Prosecutor made the following announcement when the trial was called on: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is another development in relation to Mr Phat Nguyen. Mr Phat Nguyen was here at sometime on Monday; not at 10 o’clock but thereafter. I am told that he was not here yesterday. I am told today that in fact he flew out of the country about 8.30 in the morning. He has apparently gone on holidays and is expected back, on a return flight, sometime in May, so it appears that he has disappeared. I have told my friend that. Where we go from there is an interesting question.” 
         
        
       
     9 After discussion about how the evidence was to proceed that morning, the Crown Prosecutor said that in relation to Phat Nguyen he proposed to call Detective Davis to explain his absence and that he had left Australia. He continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “The other aspect of that is the consideration of whether his statement should be tendered pursuant to section 112 [sic] of the Criminal Procedure Act, he being a person absent from Australia. I do not know what my friend’s attitude to that is. I would certainly like to know.” 
         
        
       
     10 The parties agreed that the section appropriately to be called in aid was s116 of that Act on the assumption that the written statement was a “prescribed written statement” within the meaning of subs (1). Section 116 (2) provides that: 
      
       
        
         
         “Except in so far as the court otherwise orders, a prescribed written statement may be admitted as evidence for the prosecution at the trial of the accused person on proof on oath that the person who made the statement: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) is dead, or so ill as not to be able to travel or to give evidence without a risk of endangering the person’s life, or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) is absent from Australia.” 
         
        
       
     11 The appellant’s counsel responded by saying that he wanted some time to think about it but that his “present thoughts are that that is probably an area which I will not object to”. He said he did not have any instructions but that it was a dramatic development and he wanted lengthy conferences and wanted to “explain the situation”. Counsel for the appellant wanted evidence to be called that the witness had left, or as he put it, “skipped” the country. Detective Senior Constable Davis gave evidence that he had made inquiries and was told that Phat Nguyen had left the country on the previous morning. He had not mentioned to the detective senior constable that he was going. He was booked to come back on 5 or 6 May 2001. The detective senior constable identified a statement made by Phat Nguyen which had been tendered at the committal proceedings. That was a statement of 23 February 2000 (Phat Nguyen’s first statement). 
      
       
     12 Later on 28 February 2001 counsel for the appellant said there was no issue that the statement was in a prescribed form. Asked what his attitude was going to be without finalising it, counsel said that he was almost certain that he would not object and not seek the judge’s interference through his discretion. He referred to the option of aborting the trial and starting again. Counsel did not believe that the admissibility would be questioned by him.  
      
       
     13 On the fourth day of the trial, 1 March 2001, the Crown Prosecutor advised that there had been some resolution in relation to Phat Nguyen’s first statement and it was agreed that the statement could be read to the jury with some deletions. After some agreement had apparently been reached on deletions, his Honour asked if both counsel had considered s137 of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
         
        
       
     14 McClellan J expressed the view that the section imposed an obligation on him irrespective of the view of the parties. At that point the judge was told that there was a second statement that was to be read out without deletions. His Honour was concerned that in determining probative value one should bring into account that the evidence was not reliable because the person was not available and had made himself unavailable to be called in the case. The evidence being unreliable would have little probative value and the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant might be greater than the probative value of the material. His Honour sought assistance.  
      
       
     15 Counsel for the appellant said that he had dearly wanted to cross-examine the maker of the statement. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “This trial cannot proceeded without the evidence of this man”.  
         
        
        
       and later: 
        
        
         
         “…I spoke to my client because he just does not want to remain in custody all this time; he wants a resolution et cetera, that this trial has gone such as to reveal the truth, which may not repeat as well on a next time (sic). 
         
        
        
         
         The middle position, that is to admit this material, while it is not as good as what I would have wanted is far better than aborting the trial and starting again, and having the same, perhaps, problem again, and other people disappear.

         While Phat does make some statements that are against my client, naturally, he also makes some remarkable statements which I think in the law – this is where I must reveal my case but it is not a secret; Mr Crown has been a Crown too long not to be aware of it probably as soon as I would have done – but Phat makes enough concessions in his statement to suggest that my client was come upon suddenly by him, while he is sitting there, and in fact tries to walk away, but his brother calls him on. The matter is thrust upon him.” 
         
        
       
     16 Counsel regarded part of the statement as a concession and noted that in the second statement Phat Nguyen admitted that the copper pipe which was found at the scene had been in the hands of the deceased. Counsel said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am in the situation where this case simply cannot go on without Phat Quoc Nguyen.” 
         
        
       
     17 He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If I am to choose, on the situation which now has arisen, whether your Honour would abort the trial or let it continue, I submit after a great deal of agonised thought throughout the whole of yesterday that the overwhelming, preferable view is to allow the trial to continue, and to do it in this way, as permitted by the section. 
         
        
        
         
         Of course, if your Honour were to suggest that you would allow the case to continue without the statement of Phat, that would be a situation which I would oppose. I do not think that is even suggested. I do not think I need to consider that. 
         
        
        
         
         They are the only two conditions. They are my submissions.” 
         
        
       
     18 Pressed by the trial Judge on what he said about the danger of unfair prejudice to his client, counsel said: 
      
       
        
         
         “That has to be viewed in the light of the alternative, and that is a repeat trial.” 
         
        
       
     19 His Honour asked whether the prejudice was not the prejudice at the trial before him. Counsel responded that the judge was entitled to take into account the submissions of counsel on instructions. Counsel was anxious to demonstrate that it was not only his client who had a weapon but also the deceased and his brother, Phat Nguyen. Counsel said that he wanted the trial to continue. 
      
       
     20 The trial Judge gave judgment on 2 March 2001. He noted that the whole of Phat Nguyen’s first statement was tendered absent one sentence being the third sentence in paragraph 4 and the words “holding the stick” in the fourth line of paragraph 8. His Honour described the circumstances of the tender and said that despite counsel having no objection he would have regard to the discretion available to him under s137 of the Evidence Act. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have come to the view that the probative value of the material sought to be tendered by the Crown is not outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. It seems to me from what has been disclosed by counsel for the accused that the evidence will have considerable probative value and, indeed, will undoubtedly feature in the way in which counsel for the accused seeks to put his case.  
         
        
        
         
         My concern in relation to prejudice relates to the difficulty in directing the jury as to the use which they can make of the material. I am not concerned that the jury is aware that Mr Phat Quoc Nguyen was proposed by the Crown to give evidence but has chosen to absent himself from this trial. That seems to me to raise, reasonably, a number of possibilities as to his motivation in leaving the country. However, I am satisfied, on hearing submissions from the Crown and counsel for the accused, that directions may be suitably framed which will alleviate any unfair prejudice, in the relevant sense, to the accused.” 
         
        
        
       Accordingly his Honour allowed the Crown to read the relevant parts of the statements to the jury and by that means to admit it into evidence.  
        
       
     21 Before the statement was read Justice McClellan told the jury that they needed to be careful in the way they dealt with it in forming any view in relation to the ultimate questions in the case because they would not have the advantage of seeing Phat Nguyen and seeing him give evidence in the witness box. Phat Nguyen’s first statement of 23 February 2000 as read out was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence which I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. 
         
        
        
         
         The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable for prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe to be true. 
         
        
        
         
         I am 18 years of age (10/2/1982). 
         
        
        
         
         I reside at home at 3 Dalmatian Street, Carramar with my girlfriend, her name is Phung Tran. My brother, Tuan Quoc Nguyen, lives at 19 Phelps Street, Cabramatta, by himself. 
         
        
        
         
         About September 1999 I met a person I know as Anh Tuan Le at the Cabramatta railway station. I told him that he could come over to my house and he did. I was living with my brother at 19 Phelps Street, Cabramatta at the time. Anh Tuan Le stayed with us for about one month then he moved out. Over the month that he stayed with us we didn’t hardly talk because we didn’t want him to stay with us. My brother and I didn’t have a fight with Anh Tuan Le but we just didn’t talk or really get on with him. 
         
        
        
         
         I would describe Anh Tuan Le as being about 23 years old, Vietnamese, about 180 cm tall, thin build, black hair, parted in the middle, untidy, dirty down past his ears. 
         
        
        
         
         I have seen Anh Tuan Le nearly every day in Cabramatta since he moved out of the house. I have spoken to him a couple of times since he moved out but we still didn’t talk much. 
         
        
        
         
         On Tuesday 22 February 2000 I saw Anh Tuan Le at Time Gone video games store in Railway Parade Cabramatta. I was in the store at about 4pm and I was playing video games. I then saw Anh Tuan Le he walked up to me, he was with another male who was with him today. Anh Tuan Le then stood behind me and then he hit me in the right side of the head and then just kept punching me with his fists. I then started to block his punches and punch back. Then the manager of the store came up and broke us up. Anh Tuan Le then walked outside and said to me, ‘Come outside’. I didn’t. I just stood in the store for about two minutes and then I started to walk towards the door. Anh Tuan Le then started to run at me and I stepped back inside the shop and he came in after me. Anh Tuan Le then hit me again a number of times and I fell to the ground. The manager of the store then came and split us up again and Anh Tuan Le left the store. 
         
        
        
         
         I then stood in the store for a while because I was very dizzy. Then I left the store and walked down Railway Parade towards the park and as I got to the park I saw Anh Tuan Le walking out of the park and the other guy was with him still. I would describe this man as being Vietnamese, 165 cm tall, between 22 to 25 years old, thin build, black hair, his hair is curly, his hair is short. He was wearing blue long sleeve shirt, dark coloured long pants. His skin is dark like mine. 
         
        
        
         
         The two of them walked through the park and walked back towards Cabramatta past Woolworths. I then walked to the Cabramatta Police Station and reported for bail and then I got a taxi home to Carramar. 
         
        
        
         
         I caught a train back to Cabramatta about 10.30 pm last night and then walked to 19 Phelps Street, Cabramatta. I stayed at my brother’s house with him last night. My brother and I were the only two at his house last night. 
         
        
        
         
         About 8.30 am this morning my brother Tuan Quoc Nguyen and I left his house in Phelps Street and walked to the shopping centre at Cabramatta and talked to our friends. We walked to John Street and around that area. 
         
        
        
         
         About 10.30 am my brother and I were walking from Freedom Plaza into Arthur Street, Cabramatta. As we walked down I saw Anh Tuan Le and the other man who was with him yesterday sitting outside the restaurant. They were outside the restaurant on the left as we walked down towards the station. There is a driveway to the carpark next to the restaurant. 
         
        
        
         
         As we walked down I could see Anh Tuan Le was wearing a green army type coloured long sleeve shirt, dark green long pants. The other man was wearing the same clothes as he had on yesterday when I saw him at the Time Gone video store. 
         
        
        
         
         My brother and I then walked over towards Anh Tuan Le and the other man outside the restaurant. As we got to the middle of the roadway the two of them got up and they looked like they were going to walk away. My brother then said in a loud voice to Anh Tuan Le, ‘Come I want to talk’. Anh said to my brother, ‘Wait there’. As he said this Anh walked over to the garden near the building in the carpark. I then saw him reach into the garden and picked up something. He then pulled a knife out of a bit of cloth or something. 
         
        
        
         
         Anh then started running at my brother and I. The next thing I knew, the other man grabbed hold of my hair from behind and dragged me towards the gutter. He then started hitting me in the face with his fists. I was on the ground trying to protect myself and then after a while I got free from him and ran towards my brother and Anh. I could see that Anh was stabbing my brother, he had a knife in his right hand. The knife or whatever he had in his hand was not like a normal knife, it looked like an operation type knife. Its handle looked clear with the silver blade at the end of it. I’m not sure how long it was. Anh and my brother were standing opposite each other on the roadway facing each other and Anh Tuan Le was swinging his right hand around stabbing my brother in the body. My brother then ran away towards the footpath and Anh chased him. As my brother reached the footpath he fell to the ground. 
         
        
        
         
         Anh Tuan Le then stopped and turned around and he screamed to the other man, ‘Run’. He said this in Vietnamese. The other man and Anh Tuan Le then ran down the laneway into the carpark and ran towards Woolworths. 
         
        
        
         
         I then ran to my brother and saw blood on the front of his stomach and I lifted his jumper up and saw a cut. He had a cut on the left side of his ribs. I then pressed my hand onto my brother’s cut to stop the bleeding and I told people to call an ambulance. 
         
        
        
         
         A short time later police arrived and then the ambulance arrived and they took my brother away in the ambulance.” 
         
        
       
     22 Phat Nguyen’s second statement of 20 July 2000 as read was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence which I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief. I make it knowing that if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable for prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe to be true. 
         
        
        
         
         I am 18 years of age. 
         
        
        
         
         About 4.15 pm on Thursday 20 July 2000 I attended Cabramatta Police Station and spoke with Detective Davis. He showed me a green coloured backpack and a set of keys. These items of property belonged to my brother Tuan Quoc Nguyen and were with him at the time of the incident with Anh Tuan Le. 
         
        
        
         
         I confirm that the only person involved in the incident which resulted in my brother’s death were my brother, Anh Tuan Le, me and the other person who I don’t know. The only knife that I saw during the incident was the knife that Le stabbed my brother with. Detective Davis also asked me about a metal pipe that was found at the scene of the incident. I can confirm that this pipe was used by my brother at the time of the incident. 
         
        
        
         
         I can also confirm that my brother smoked heroin on a daily basis. I am aware that he smoked heroin about three years before his death. My brother never injected heroin.” 
         
        
        
       
     23 At the close of the Crown case the trial Judge raised the question of whether Phat Nguyen’s statements should be withdrawn from the jury. He observed that the statements may have very little probative value. “It cannot be tested. It is made by a person who was, himself, involved in the fracas, a fracas which, on the material otherwise available on the statement, appears to have had a history at least going back to the preceding day and possibly before then, although that is speculation.” He regarded it as open to the jury to speculate why Phat Nguyen was not available to give evidence. He sought assistance from counsel. His Honour was concerned about evidence of self-defence. The Crown submitted that the trial Judge “could not exclude the Phat statement”, but acknowledged that he had the power to do so.  
      
       
     24 His Honour remarked during the course of submissions that there really was not a respectable self-defence claim made by the accused. The Crown Prosecutor said: 
      
       
        
         
         “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour should tell the jury that in assessing the reliability of Phat Nguyen they should take into account the matters your Honour just mentioned; the fact that he absented himself and, secondly, the fact that when he gave his first account to the police it had a significant inaccuracy or omission, in that he made no mention of the fact that the deceased had the pipe. Your Honour should tell the jury that directly. Your Honour should also tell the jury that they may feel, before they can comfortably act upon the account given by Phat Nguyen, they should look for some support in other evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: What do I do about any speculation they might be engaging in as to why he left? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: There are various ways of touching that. Some people say, if you give a direction about it, it tends to emphasise it. Some people say you should just leave it alone completely. In the circumstances of this case, where it is so obvious that there is a number of obvious alternatives as to why he is not here, your Honour should give the jury, when talking about the reliability of his evidence, a positive direction that they are not to associate his disappearance in any way with the accused – that would be wrong – subject to what my friend says. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: You submit to me, do you, that a direction given by me in those terms would cure any potential difficulty arising from speculation? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: I do, because, prima facie, the most obvious reason he disappeared, I would think, is because he was uncomfortable about being here. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Putting it bluntly, fearful of the accused. ‘Uncomfortable’ does not answer the question. He could be uncomfortable for a positive or negative reason. Is not the most likely reason that he is fearful of the accused, rightly or wrongly? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: It is certainly up there as a contender. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Especially when you have the history of the day before the event, and then you have the day itself. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         The jury should be told not to draw any inference adverse to the accused and that there is no suggestion that his disappearance has anything to do with the accused. I would think that the jury would heed such a warning.” 
         
        
       
     25 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the statements of Phat Nguyen should be excluded. It was pointed out that the only real statement as to the accused stabbing the deceased came from that source. The other statement which Mr Banks “threw in” in cross-examination, and to which I shall return, had never previously been made. The Crown indicated that if Phat Nguyen’s statement was excluded the Crown would continue with the trial. Counsel for the accused submitted that the trial should end. He submitted not only that the evidence of the statement but also the evidence from the witness Mr Banks should be excluded and that there was no case. As the discussion developed, counsel for the accused submitted that it was both prejudicial to his client if Phat Nguyen’s statement remained in evidence and prejudicial if it did not. Combined with this was an argument that Mr Banks’ evidence should be excluded because it was unreliable. The question seemed to resolve itself towards excluding Phat Nguyen’s statement by use of s137 tempered by concern about the fairness of the trial if this material was excluded.  
      
       
     26 After an adjournment, counsel for the accused said he had received instructions and that his position was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “My first position is that your Honour would remove from the jury Phat’s statements and the other two areas of which I spoke, but your Honour has clearly indicated to me that that is not the way your Honour is minded to go, in which case, if your Honour is not minded to remove the other two areas of Banks and Bunny, then my instructions are to ask your Honour to permit the trial to go on as it has up until now.” 
         
        
        
       As McClellan J pointed out that was, in other words, with the Phat Nguyen material in. 
        
       
     27 On the following day, counsel for the accused withdrew his concession that the trial Judge had power to remove the Phat Nguyen statement. Asked whether his position was that he wanted the trial to proceed with that material in, counsel said: 
      
       
        
         
         “That has always been my position, with the exception that when your Honour suggested that you would remove it, and I said I would only make submissions if your Honour were then willing to remove certain other materials, namely, the material which I submitted is straw-like in weight – I didn’t use those words -- 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: In any event you now say I can’t remove the Phat material, is that right?” 
         
        
        
       Counsel said that that was correct. 
        
       
     28 On 6 March 2001 McClellan J gave judgment in which he rehearsed that counsel for the accused indicated he would seek to have the Phat Nguyen material withdrawn from the jury provided the evidence of the witnesses Mr Banks and Ms Bunny, which in different ways went to the identity of the person who killed the accused, was also withdrawn relying upon s137 of the Evidence Act 1995. His Honour had indicated that he was not persuaded that whatever happened to the Phat Nguyen material he should make any order withdrawing any of the evidence of the witnesses Mr Banks and Ms Bunny from the jury. That morning counsel had confirmed that in the event that the trial Judge made no order in relation to any of the evidence of the witnesses Mr Banks and Ms Bunny he did not seek to have the Phat Nguyen material withdrawn from the jury. 
      
       
     29 His Honour said as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “I had previously indicated that I hold considerable reservations in relation to the evidence of the witness, Phat, being given to the jury in the form of his statement. My concern is heightened by the fact that the jury are aware that Phat, apparently voluntarily, left Australia on the morning of the second day of this trial. By this means he ensured that he would not be available to give evidence and be cross-examined in the course of the proceedings. I have a concern as to whether it will be possible to frame directions to the jury which ensure that they do not speculate as to the reason for the absence of Mr Phat and whether, accordingly, his evidence may be misused. 
         
        
        
         
         However, if I was now to reconsider the approach to that evidence and exercise the power available to me to withdraw material from the jury, I would, of course, be acting contrary to the express wishes of counsel for the accused. The fact that such power is available cannot, in my opinion, be doubted, having regard to the remarks of the Chief Justice in  
         R v R  
         (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at page 76. 
         
        
        
         
         In the event that counsel for the accused does not make any application for the Phat material to be withdrawn, I have formed the view that it would not be appropriate for me to make any such order.” 
         
        
       
     30 In R v R, to which the trial Judge referred, the Court of Criminal Appeal answered in the negative the question: “Does a trial judge have the power to direct a verdict of acquittal when the trial judge assesses the evidence is such that a verdict of guilty based upon it would be unsafe and unsatisfactory?”. In Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 212-213, the High Court said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The question whether a trial judge may direct a jury to return a verdict of not guilty if, in his or her opinion, a guilty verdict would be unsafe or unsatisfactory was adverted to but left unanswered in  
         Whitehorn v The Queen 
          (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 689. There is no doubt that it is a trial judge’s duty to direct such a verdict if the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or, as is commonly said, if there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict: see, for example,  
         Plomp  
         (1963) 110 CLR at 246;  
         Reg v Prasad 
          (1979) 23 SASR 161 at 162;  
         Reg v R 
          (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at 77. And it may sometimes happen (although it should be but rarely) that evidence is withdrawn because it becomes apparent that, although technically admissible, it has no or insignificant probative value in comparison with its prejudicial effect, with the consequence that, if the remaining evidence will not support a guilty verdict, a verdict of not guilty must be directed: see, as to the discretion to reject technically admissible evidence,

         However, the question raised when, for whatever reason, the evidence will not sustain a verdict of guilty is distinct from that raised in the present case where the evidence of Freeman, if believed, is itself sufficient to sustain the applicant’s conviction.” 
         
        
       
     31 At 214-5 their Honours said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.” 
         
        
       
     32 Thus the stage had been reached in the trial where on two occasions counsel for the appellant had insisted that the statement of Phat Nguyen should remain before the jury except on conditions which his Honour was not prepared to accept, on the face of it with good reason. Application was then made by counsel for the accused for a Prasad direction (R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161) which his Honour refused. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have considered the position in relation to such a direction but have come to the view that the evidence, which the Crown has led in this case, is such that it would not appropriate for me to give a Prasad direction at this stage of the proceedings.” 
         
        
       
     33 In R v Mendham & Foster (1993) 71 A Crim R 382 Gleeson CJ, with whose judgment Handley JA and Grove J agreed, considered the admissibility (under the repealed s409 of the Crimes Act 1900) of the evidence of a police officer at a committal hearing who was unable to attend the trial because he was ill. His Honour said at 388: 
      
       
        
         
         “The authorities make it clear that, even if Sergeant Hain’s deposition had been admissible under s409, the trial judge should have given the jury an appropriate warning of the approach to be taken of that evidence. His Honour was asked to give such a warning but declined to do so. 
         
        
        
         
         In  
         Henriques 
          (1991) 93 Cr App R 237 at 242 the Privy Council said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘When a judge allows deposition evidence to be admitted he should as a matter of course warn the jury that they have neither had the benefit of seeing the deponent nor of hearing his evidence tested in cross-examination and that they must take this into consideration when evaluating the reliability of his evidence. Furthermore as Lord Griffiths said in  
           Scott and Barnes 
            [1989] AC 1242; (1989) 89 Cr App R 153 at 161: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             ‘in many cases it will be appropriate for a judge to develop this warning by pointing out particular features of the evidence in the deposition which conflict with other evidence and which could have been explored in cross-examination’. ’ 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
         The present case involved a good example of the sort of thing to which Lord Griffiths was referring. There was a clear and important conflict between the evidence of Hain and the evidence of Eastwood, relating to the matter of Hain’s notebook. This is just the sort of matter that should have been dealt with in the course of an appropriate warning. 
         
        
        
         
         To like effect was the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in  
         Horan 
          [1951] VLR 249.” 
         
        
       
     34 In summing up to the jury, McClellan reminded them that in the first of Phat Nguyen statements there was no reference to any weapon in the hands of the deceased or Phat Nguyen but that in the second statement he confirmed that the pipe found at the scene of the incident was used by his brother at the time of the incident. His Honour summarised parts of the first statement and read some parts. The trial Judge gave the following warning about Phat Nguyen’s evidence. 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, you will also remember the evidence from the deceased’s brother, Phat Quoc Nguyen, which was put before you when the Crown Prosecutor read from Mr Phat’s statement tendered at committal. It is important that I give you a special warning to be careful as to the weight you give to that evidence. As you know, Mr Phat Quoc Nguyen was not called to give oral evidence because he left Australia on the first Tuesday of the trial and was not expected to return until May. It may be that you have speculated as to why he left Australia, but it is important that you leave any speculation aside and do not attempt to form any view as to why he left the country. Indeed, my direction is that you are bound to put from your minds any speculation as to why Phat Quoc Nguyen left Australia. 
          
          
         I also direct you that you should exercise great care before attributing weight to Mr Phat’s evidence. He is, of course, the brother of the deceased and was himself engaged in the skirmish in which his brother died. He was also involved in the fight the previous day which he apparently lost. It would appear he did not like the accused. Because he has not given evidence orally, you have not been able to form any assessment of him by observing him in the witness box and hearing him give evidence. More importantly, he has not been cross-examined and, accordingly, the accused has not, through his counsel, been able to challenge the truth of anything said in his statement. For these reasons I direct you that you must exercise great care before attributing weight to his evidence, especially when it conflicts with the evidence of another witness and that, of course, includes the accused. You could, of course, have greater confidence in accepting the evidence where it is corroborated by the evidence of another witness. However, it would be dangerous to convict the accused relying only on the evidence of Mr Phat.” 
         
        
       
     35 As will appear in what I say later there were parts of Phat Nguyen’s evidence which were inconsistent with the evidence of any other witness, in particular that he remained and cared for his brother after his brother fell to the ground and did not immediately run away.  
      
       
        
       Mr Banks 
        
       
     36 Benjamin Cameron Banks gave evidence that he arrived in Cabramatta at about 9 am on the morning of the incident. He found himself at what was described as the station end of Arthur Street and noticed a couple of guys run across the road and noticed the fight. The guys were Asian. They ran towards the carpark. They were in their mid-20s. One was wearing thongs, one was wearing thongs, jeans and a checked shirt. One was slim, one was medium. He saw a scuffle, an argument. The people ran across the road to a couple that were standing in the driveway of the carpark. He said, when asked what happened, that it started off as an argument, an exchange of words, and then they started hitting each other, kicking each other. They were hitting and kicking each other and there were weapons involved as well. The people who had the weapons were those that ran across the road. He managed to see a knife and a copper bar. The knife was said to be about 25 or 30 cms in length. He said he had seen who had the knife. He said he had seen the arm swing around and the knife connected to the person’s chest. That person fell to the ground in the middle of the driveway to the carpark. He walked towards the person. The fight broke up and the couple actually like split up and ran away. The person who fell to the ground got kicked a couple of times but he could not say by whom. He said that four split up and ran off. He stayed around the scene trying to help. Asked about the knife he said the blade was not a big one. It was not long but a short blade knife. It had a brown handle, the blade was a dirty old sort of colour. The dimensions he gave of the pipe were about 45 cms. He was not able to say anything about a pipe which was exhibit 2. He said the knife, exhibit 1, was the one he had seen. He had seen that knife in the hand of the person who did the stabbing.  
      
       
     37 Mr Banks was cross-examined about his recollection and the four people who ran away. The one who had the knife ran towards the train station. He agreed that the man with the pipe ran through an alleyway into Hughes Street which was in a northerly direction. He was not sure that he had seen the man with the pipe run away up there. Then he gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You saw these four run away. Some or one ran up Hughes Street. Some or one ran along to the railway station, along Arthur Street. Is that right? A. Yep. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the one who ran along Arthur Street was the person who you say had the knife? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Are you quite sure of that? A. Yeah, I’m sure of that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What about the other two people? Where did they run? A. One ran through the alleyway.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Which alleyway? A. Towards John Street. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You told us one ran up – I am sorry, towards John Street, the other alley way. What about the fourth person? A. Followed him slowly. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So, two went along John Street? A. The last one hung around a bit; walking around everywhere. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So, two ran along John Street. One ran up – the one with the pipe you say ran up -- A. Yep. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. --John Street. Was he still carrying the pipe? A. I can’t recall. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But he was the one who had been using the pipe, you say. That’s what you’ve told us. Do you not recall? Mr Banks, do you recall or not? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. These four people who ran away, some were on one side; some were on the other side? A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. From what you have told us, it seems that the two people on one side were the two who respectively ran one towards the railway station and one up Hughes Street. That was one side, wasn’t it? A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That’s what you have told us, isn’t it? A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that’s correct? Yes? A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the other two who ran away were on the other side? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. They are the ones who went up John Street. Now, you were shown by my learned friend, the other person dressed in this crazy costume, a knife. Right? A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The truth of the matter is you can’t remember now which person on which side held the pipe, can you? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the truth of the matter is you can’t remember now which person on which side had the knife? A. No. I know who had the knife. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You know who had the knife. Who was that? A. This guy here (witness indicated). 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You are pointing to this guy here (indicated). You mean, of course, the accused, do you? A. I know his face. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You know his face. So, that’s the man who didn’t run up Hughes Street, is it? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That’s the man who ran to the railway station? A. Ran towards the railway station. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You haven’t been taking any substances, have you? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You think that’s stupid do you? Something that might affect your memory, recollection or understanding. Can you answer that? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What about at the time A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You hadn’t? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         GUMBERT: I have an application, if the jury could leave the Court. It may be that my learned friend will concede.” 
         
        
       
     38 Counsel’s application did not relate directly to the identification. He indicated that he wished to cross-examine the witness about his credibility apparently in a context of substance abuse. The Crown Prosecutor responded by saying: 
      
       
        
         
         “If he simply explores the aspect of him being under the influence of drugs, then I would not treat it as raising the issue of character, if the accused gave evidence. It is really a question of degree.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel for the accused said that, the Crown Prosecutor having made his attitude clear, he did not seek any ruling. 
        
       
     39 The cross-examination of Mr Banks continued. Counsel did not directly put to him that his identification of the person who had the knife as the appellant in the dock was wrong. He confirmed that he had said “that my client ran along Arthur Street east towards Railway Parade.” He was again shown the knife, exhibit 1, and he said that could be the knife which was earlier identified by him as the knife the appellant had in his hands when the deceased was stabbed. 
      
       
     40 In summing up, his Honour told the jury that he had to give them special directions about the identification evidence and referred to Mr Banks’ evidence identifying the accused as having the knife when he had not previously identified the accused. His Honour pointed out that identification evidence had to be approached with special caution and explained the reasons why. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Firstly, the evidence which Mr Banks gave was not given when he was being examined in chief. It was not obtained by the Crown but came in response to a question by Dr Gumbert in cross-examination. 
         
        
        
         
         Secondly, Mr Banks gave evidence of observing the accused to be the person holding the knife, which he identified as the knife in exhibit 1. 
         
        
        
         
         Now, it is, of course, a matter for you, but you may have the view, because of the size of the wound on the deceased, a width of 2 centimetres, the knife which is exhibit 1 could not have caused the injury. If you have, that view it may suggest that Mr Banks’ evidence identifying the accused as holding the knife which stabbed the deceased may be unreliable. 
         
        
        
         
         Thirdly, the events which Mr Banks observed occurred during a very short space of time and apparently involved only Asian men. It may be difficult for Mr Banks to identify a particular individual whom he had never previously known during an event which occurred rapidly and involved a great deal of activity. 
         
        
        
         
         Fourthly, Mr Banks was making his identification more than twelve months after the events took place and only when the accused was in the dock. It will be apparent to you that evidence of identification of the accused as the person committing the crime, when he has obviously been identified by others and is on his trial, should be approached with the greatest of caution. 
         
        
        
         
         Those are matters which you are bound to consider when deciding whether you will accept the identification evidence in this case as reliable.” 
         
        
       
     41 Later in his summing up following submissions from counsel for the appellant, the trial Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, I want to return to a couple of matters that we mentioned before the adjournment. Firstly, you will remember that I was talking to you about the evidence of Mr Banks and I told you that there were a number of reasons why you should be careful. I said: Approach his evidence with great caution. The fourth matter I mentioned to you was that Mr Banks was making his identification more than twelve months after the events took place and only when the accused was in the dock. I went on to say that it would be apparent to you that evidence of the identification of the accused as the person committing the crime, when he has obviously been identified by others and is on his trial, should be approached with great caution. I want to tell you also that not only should you approach that evidence in those circumstances where he has identified the accused in the dock with great caution but in those circumstances you should give it very little weight.” 
         
        
       
     42 Later still, his Honour returned and set out some detail of Mr Banks’ evidence by quotation from the transcript. He referred to what he had said earlier about the approach that should be taken and having recited the details said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I repeat to you again that I have already given you directions in relation to the weight, if any, which you can give to that evidence, being given by the witness in the witness box, the accused being in the dock. You, of course, will also have to look at that evidence in light of other evidence which you have as to where persons ran after the incident occurred.” 
         
        
       
     43 Later again, after submissions from counsel, his Honour read further parts of Mr Banks’ evidence. Separately he dealt with evidence about knives and other weapons present at the scene. In the course of that he referred to what Mr Banks said. 
      
       
     44 After the close of the Crown case, counsel for the appellant applied to have Mr Banks’ evidence of identification withdrawn from the jury. In the course of the submission his Honour indicated that counsel could assume for the purpose of getting instructions that he was against the submission. The instructions related to the admission of the Phat Nguyen’s statements already adverted to. I have already summarised the effect of the judgment of 6 March 2001 in which McClellan J dealt with this question. 
      
       
        
       Other Crown witnesses 
        
       
     45 The evidence of the other witnesses in the area at the time of the stabbing, whose names I have already listed, was – not surprisingly on account of the suddenness and speed of what occurred – often incompatible and inconsistent.  
      
       
     46 Randi Obrenovic did not know the appellant though he had seen him before. He saw the fight after it began. He knew the deceased as Russell and his brother as Brendon. He saw the accused punching Russell and hitting Brendon. Russell was holding a pole. He chased a curly haired man to the railway station. He said the accused ran down this sort of alleyway leading to Woolworths. Russell had a knife. He chased the curly haired man to the railway station. When he returned he saw a knife on the ground. It had a wooden handle “a pointed handle” and was about 30 cms long with a sterling silver blade like a chopping knife. There was “an Asian dude with long hair” who was just watching. He was about 165 cms tall. All the witness saw him do was move the knife with his foot. He saw only the one knife. In cross-examination he said that the man who he thought had stabbed Russell had gone up the laneway to Hughes Street. The other person he chased he thought was about 175 or 180 cms in height. He described the knife as having a brown handle. 
      
       
     47 Rebecca Martinez had come by train to Cabramatta that morning and saw the appellant squatting down in front of a restaurant in Arthur Street with another Asian male. She said he was wearing a cream satin shirt with dark green slacks pants. The shirt was long sleeved. Later she saw the appellant running from where she had seen him first and going in the direction of Woolworths. He was running as if in a panic. He was barefooted. Previously when she saw him he was wearing thongs. He had an object which she could not identify in his hand. Later she saw the deceased lying on the ground.  
      
       
     48 Joshua Martinez was Rebecca’s brother and with his sister at the time in question. He knew the appellant and also saw him running into the Woolworths’ carpark. He described him as wearing a white, collared shirt and green slacks like pants with black running shoes on and a black bum bag. He did not know who he saw with the appellant but said he had curly hair at the top, short around the sides. Later he saw the appellant run past him, running into the Woolworths’ carpark alone. He did not say that the appellant had anything in his hand when he saw him running. 
      
       
     49 Steven Dobbin was working as a locksmith at Raine & Horne on Arthur Street on the morning in question. While he was walking across the road to his vehicle he observed “a lot of screaming and yelling coming from the end of the street” meaning the opposite end of Arthur Street running towards Railway Parade. He saw two Asian men running, one chasing the other and a few more running behind them. They were running towards Railway Parade. He saw the man who was being chased being pushed. “The man being chased turned around quickly and the other man looked like he pushed him”. The man being pushed hit the ground and the other man kept running. Subsequently he observed blood starting to appear on the ground. The man he thought pushed the other was around 6 feet tall wearing green trousers, a long sleeved grey shirt and white joggers. He had long black hair. The man who kept running ran on towards the railway station. The other people ran to the man on the ground. He did not see anyone running through either of the laneways leading to Hughes Street to the north or to John Street to the south. He left the scene very quickly. He did not see any weapons. 
      
       
     50 Guy Kerslake gave evidence that at about 10 am on 23 February 2000 while in the company of Bernice Bunny he saw a scuffle in what appears to have been Arthur Street, Cabramatta. Four people were involved, all Asian. It was basically just a lot of pushing and shoving and then he saw one of them when they finally got off the road collapsed on the driveway. He saw at least two bread knives and a pole. After the person hit the ground, some of them came back and quickly “grabbed them all up and kicked the pole underneath the car”. The pole looked like a copper pipe. He was 100 yards away. He did not see the person in the middle who collapsed “get stabbed or anything”. He was shown exhibit 1 which he said did not look anything like the knives he saw. He said the whole incident was “very very very quick”. He said that before the fellow collapsed on the ground “all I seen was the back of some Chinese, Asian, I don’t know what, they all look the same to me, and all I seen was like, it could even have looked like a punch”. Asked whether he had indicated a thrusting motion with his right hand he said “like I said, it could have just been like a kidney punch or something you know, and that knife, the first knife you showed me, I seen the wound when the ambulance got there”. He had no idea what the man was wearing. He said that the pole that was kicked under the car was larger and different from exhibit 2. The people who ran back and picked up the knives came through the little alleyway up into John Street. He said that the two men who scooped up the knives ran away down Ingal Way which runs to the south of Arthur Street in the direction of John Street. 
      
       
     51 The witness had put to him a statement that he had made to the police which was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “When they got to the side of the road I saw one of the men with the knives stab the guy that was being pushed. I saw him stab him to the side of the chest. The guy who had been stabbed then fell straight to the ground.” 
         
        
       
     52 Under cross-examination when asked whether it appeared to him that what he saw was a stab he said, “It didn’t actually, until the ambulance officer cut his shirt off”. 
      
       
     53 The next witness was Toan Trieu Tu who claimed to be a friend of the deceased. He was present and saw the fighting and the “guy” fall down but denied taking part in the fight. Four people were involved in the fighting, all Asian. He saw punching, jumping and kicking. He denied pushing a knife with his foot. It was suggested to him by counsel for the appellant that he, the deceased and “persons in that group, one of whom was the deceased and his brother” had made prior plans to attack the appellant and his friend. The witness denied it. He was asked whether he had concealed a knife in preparation for the attack on a ledge of a nearby air conditioning unit and denied it. The trial was adjourned for the day and the witness was ill the following morning. He returned to the witness box on 1 March 2001. He denied the suggestion put to him in several questions which followed that he had taken part with others in an attack upon the appellant. He agreed that he was a friend of the deceased.  
      
       
     54 On the morning of 23 February 2000 Domenico Carzo went to Cabramatta to see his dentist who practised in Arthur Street. Upon leaving the dentist after half an hour he walked through the lane towards John Street. As he was going into John Street he noticed a person “stretch his arm” and place what looked to be a kitchen knife on a window ledge. He was medium build, looked Asian and was wearing dark trousers. He walked beside Mr Carzo into John Street. The knife was a fixed blade knife like a kitchen sort of knife around 170-200 mm long with a blade about 12-15 mm wide. The handle was black. He saw the person who placed the knife on top of the window ledge in the crowd and saw the police talking to him and after a while taking him away. Mr Carzo was taken to inspect a garbage bin not far from the window ledge and was shown a knife which was not the same as the one he had seen on the window ledge. When he returned to the window ledge the knife was not there. He agreed that the person he saw putting the knife on the ledge had long hair down to his shoulders and was clean-shaven. The witness identified in court the previous witness Mr Tu as the person he had seen putting the knife on the window ledge. He was further examined by the Crown to suggest he had made a mistake in identifying the person who the police were talking to as the person who had put the knife on the ledge. He replied “I didn’t make a mistake”.  
      
       
     55 Bernice Lee Bunny went at about 10 am on 23 February 2000 to the Cabramatta area with her boyfriend, Mr Kerslake. She found herself at the top of Arthur Street where she saw three men who were fighting and pulled another “guy” over to the car park. She said: “And then all I saw was someone - I think he was the main bloke. He actually – I saw him actually stab him with a knife”. By this she meant the person pulled along by the other three men. The main bloke was taller than any other Asian, about six feet she thought. He had black hair and black track suit pants on. In addition to the knife used she saw some knives on the ground and a pipe. They left the knives and ran off. One of the blokes came back and collected all the knives and went up the alleyway. He kicked the pipe under one of the cars. He went up the alleyway and put the knives in the bin. It was the alleyway that led into John Street. The other two men took off up the same laneway. She did not know any of the people. She assisted the man on the ground. She said in cross-examination: “I remember very well the bloke that actually stabbed the man”. Clear in her mind was seeing the man scoop up the knives and kick the pipe under the cars. He then went down the laneway to John Street and dumped a knife or knives into a garbage bin. The man she saw with the knife had short hair and was taller than any Asian she had ever seen. She was pretty sure that the man who did the stabbing came back for the knife. She said that after the bloke was stabbed this other bloke hit him with the pipe as he was going down. Another Asian bloke was kicking him. She was asked about the laneway going to Hughes Street and said: “He didn’t go up Hughes”. She definitely did not see anyone going up the laneway to Hughes Street. 
      
       
     56 Gregory Lombardi was in the Cabramatta area on 23 February 2000. He saw a friend of his in Freedom Plaza Cabramatta and was talking to him. He then saw a short Asian man with long dark hair past his shoulders in the company of a thin blonde Caucasian girl. The Asian man stopped and talked to a short fair-haired Australian man just outside a variety store in John Street. The Australian man said: “What did you do?” It was then put to Mr Lombardi that he heard the Asian man say: “I hit him once in the ribcage”. Mr Lombardi said that was a mistake. The speaker did not say: “I hit him in the ribcage”, he said: “He hit him in the ribcage”. At that stage he was about four feet away from the Asian man. He saw the Asian man move his right arm in a forward motion with his right hand closed like he was stabbing somebody. He indicated by putting his closed fist towards the middle of his own stomach. The Australian man said: “You must have got him in the right spot”. The Asian man did not reply and walked off with the Caucasian girl. Later in Arthur Street he saw a lot of police officers one of whom told him there had been a fight. He told them of the conversation he had overheard. He described the man. He did not recall saying that he had heard the man say “I stabbed him once below the ribcage”. He indicated a man who was there and saw a policeman go and speak to him. Mr Lombardi was shown the statements he had signed in which the word “I” so appeared. He was cross-examined extensively on the change he made. In cross-examination by the Crown, the witness agreed that at the time of the conversation he was unaware there had been a stabbing. When he became aware of the stabbing he jumped to certain conclusions. That coloured his recollection to some extent of the conversation that took place. 
      
       
     57 Tania Leanne Murrell knew Mr Tu and was present at the conversation with him. According to her the Australian male said: “He slammed it into him”. She made a statement on 23 February. 
      
       
     58 A written statement was read dealing with the appellant’s attempts to run away and evade the police before he was arrested on 17 March 2000 .  
      
       
        
       Appellant’s evidence 
        
       
     59 The appellant gave evidence of the time that he stayed in the same house as the deceased and his brother, his relationship with them and the fight that had taken place in the game shop the day before the stabbing. The next morning at about 10.30 he was in Arthur Street sitting with an acquaintance he had met two or three times and knew by the name of Nhat. There was a restaurant where he was sitting which he identified from a photograph. He saw Phat Nguyen, his brother and another two people in the middle of the car park. The lane to John Street was behind them and they were walking towards him. On the other side of the road one of them stopped and the rest, including Phat Nguyen and his brother, continued to walk towards him. They looked very aggressive. The appellant started to walk away and the deceased said “Come over here, I want to talk to you”, in a very loud voice. The appellant continued to walk away towards a park where there were lots of people standing. He was walking quickly.  
      
       
     60 At about that time the deceased and other people took out their weapons and started to attack him. Phat Nguyen had a big knife and the deceased had a metal pipe. The appellant was very frightened and ran across the street and saw three or four people approaching him from the opposite direction in front of him. “I thought that I should try to get something”, something for his protection. He looked for it in a garden where he had seen someone putting an item. He got this item which was about 40 or 50 cms long and about 4 or 5 cms wide. It was in a sock.  
      
       
     61 When he turned around these people were around him and the fight already started. Asked what he was doing with “that piece of steel” he said “I used that item to swing around so that people cannot come close to me”. He thought the person he had been sitting with was behind the people that were attacking him. He said that the third person looked like an Asian witness in the trial, Mr Tu. He could not remember 100 per cent. Nobody in the group was on his side. The fight moved off the footpath. He saw the deceased walking away from the group of people just a few steps and then he fell down. He took the opportunity to run away. He ran towards the land near the restaurant and then to the car park to Hughes Street. He was very frightened. He had in his hand the item that he had picked up earlier. He did not know the deceased had been stabbed. He threw the weapon away.  
      
       
     62 That night he learnt that the fight had resulted in someone being “stabbed dead”. He was very scared because he thought about people from the gangs who might be trying to find him for revenge. He was told by someone that the police were asking people if they knew him. He tried to hide because he thought the police might charge him wrongly for a murder he had not done. On 17 March a policeman saw him and called out to him. He was very scared and that is why he was trying to run away. He said that there was no blood on the knife that he threw away though he was not 100 per cent sure. He was sure there was no blood on his hands. He said that it was possible that his weapon came in contact with someone when he was flailing it around to keep the people away but it happened very quickly so he did not remember. He said the pole, exhibit 2, looked like the item in the hand of the deceased. It was possible the knife, exhibit 1, was the knife that Phat Nguyen had. 
      
       
     63 In cross-examination the appellant agreed that there had been a dispute when he was staying with Phat Nguyen and he refused to lend them money. He was asked questions about visits to Cabramatta after he left Phat Nguyen’s house. The cross-examination was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Just before we go on to that, is it correct, after you left Phat’s residence you went to Cabramatta almost every day? A. It is not the case that I went to Cabramatta every day but a couple of weeks prior to the event, yes, I had been there very often. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I said almost every day, I am not suggesting you were there actually every day, but almost every day from the time you left Phat’s residence. Is that right? A. No, that is not correct, but it is the case that I’d been there from time to time in order to buy Asian and Vietnamese food. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you buy Asian and Vietnamese food at Bankstown? A. Well, yes, I could buy the Vietnamese food in Bankstown, but in Cabramatta there is more variety. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Let me put it directly to you, Mr Le, you were hanging around the streets of Cabramatta almost daily, weren’t you? A. Not every day. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it about 4 o’clock in the afternoon that you saw Phat at Time Gone? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you walked in, you were with another male person, weren’t you? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You walked in alone? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have any particular reason to go to Time Gone on this day? A. In order to play electronic games. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do they have electronic games at Bankstown? A. But I had been in Cabramatta looking for work, so I didn’t bother to come back to Bankstown in order to play electronic games. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you know that Phat liked electronic games as at February 2000? Did you know that? A. I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you were living with Phat, had you ever been to Time Gone with Phat? A. I don’t recall. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he ever talk about an interest in amusement parlours? A. I don’t recall.” 
         
        
       
     64 He denied that on the occasion of the fight on the night before the incident, after the manager had broken the fight up, he said to Phat Nguyen “Come outside” and that when Phat Nguyen walked towards the door he ran at him. He said that when he walked to the door of the store Phat was running after him and trying to punch him and they had a fight there and then and that after that he left. He was asked the following questions: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Okay. Did you have a pair of dark green, long pants? A. I don’t remember but most of my pants are in dark colour. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Right. Now, I suggest to you that on 23 February you were in the company of the same man who was in your company the day before. That is the man I have suggested to you is the curly-haired man. What do you say about that? A. No, that is not correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And I would suggest to you that on 23 February, during the incident, you were in possession of a knife which looked like an operation-type knife? 
         
        
        
         
         GUMBERT: Could my friend make that clear. I am not sure what he means. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Like a scalpel? A. I did not have such a knife. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have a knife with a silver blade? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have a knife with a handle that looked clear? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you take the knife out of the sock, did you? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So, the whole time you had the knife it was inside the sock, was it? A. It was partly covered. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What footwear were you wearing on 23 February? A. I cannot remember. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you wearing thongs? A. I don’t remember. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Joggers? A. Normally I would wear sports shoes but I don’t remember whether or not I was wearing the shoes on that day. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What other shoes did you have apart from sports shoes? A. I had leather shoes, black in colour, and I used them when I was wearing suits. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Are you right-handed? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you were flailing around with this weapon, did you have it in your right hand? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say that the weapon may have contacted with the deceased. Right? A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Apart from the weapon that you had, did you see any other weapon go anywhere near the deceased? A. At that time I didn’t pay any attention to anybody else, but I was trying to protect myself.” 
         
        
       
     65 He was asked questions about his attendance at the language school. Later he was asked: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. All right. So, you were attacked, were you, by three people with weapons. Is that what you are saying? 
         
        
        
         
         GUMBERT: That is not what he is saying. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. I am asking you. Do you say that? A. What I am saying is that I am very sure that Tuan and Phat had their weapons and I thought that the third person also had weapon. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did anybody use a weapon on you? A. When these people ran into me and I ran away. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did anybody use a weapon on you? A. Because when I saw them taking out their weapons, I ran away and I didn’t see them because they were behind me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So, to your observation nobody ever attempted to use a weapon on you. Is that right? A. They ran into me in order to attack me and, of course, I had to run away and I could not afford to wait for them to attack me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So, you didn’t have any injuries at all. Is that right? A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t have a mark on you, did you? A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Before you ran away, you yelled out ‘Run. Run’, didn’t you? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You yelled out ‘Run. Run’, didn’t you Mr Le? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I suggest you yelled that out because you knew you had stabbed the deceased? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you did run? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And your companion ran? A. I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he have a weapon? A. I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he have a piece of pipe? A. I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he have a knife? A. I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have another friend there who joined in with a knife? A. I don’t know.” 
         
        
       
     66 He was asked a little later: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Why did you get rid of the weapon you had? A. After running a distance and I look back and I didn’t see anybody, then I threw away (sic). 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, you got rid of it because you knew you had stabbed somebody with it, didn’t you? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I suggest to you that the weapon you actually had was one that had a blade no more than two centimetres wide. What do you say about that? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How do you know? Did you take it out of the sock? A. I did not but I look at from the outside and it was quite large. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I am suggesting that you are making up the dimensions of the knife to suit your own convenience? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You know very well, don’t you, that you stabbed the deceased? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When he fell down, who was near him? A. I think there was nobody near him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Except you? A. Including me. Not near him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How could you possibly think that your knife may have wounded him if you were not near him? A. I don’t know because the fight happened very quickly, involving a number of people moving around. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Involving a number of people on your side. Is that right? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When the deceased fell down, you were there with a knife? A. Yes, I was there, but I cannot deny or admit that I was responsible. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So, the deceased was within reach of you. Is that so? A. So, everybody was there in the fight and then he walk just a couple of steps. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who else was within reach of the deceased at the time he fell down? A. Nobody. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That is nobody apart from you? A. When everybody else and I was still in the fight, the location, then the man walked a few steps away and fell down. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You had a friend there who had a knife, didn’t you? A. I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You had another friend there with a piece of pipe, didn’t you? A. I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. After the deceased fell down, he was kicked, wasn’t he, by yourself and your friends? A. No, that is not correct. As soon as the man fell down, everybody else stopped and took the opportunity to run away. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He was hit by the man with the pipe, wasn’t he? A. I don’t know.” 
         
        
       
     67 A little later he was asked: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Just to get the sequence again, I am suggesting, Mr Le, that the deceased called out the words ‘Come. I want to talk’? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Then I am suggesting that you said ‘Wait there’? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Okay. Then, after the words ‘Come. I want to talk’, after that, you went over to the garden area? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. All right. You say what? What did you do? A. After he said that, I continued to walk away and then I saw them taking out their weapons, together with the third person. Then I ran away.” 
         
        
       
     68 Asked how the people stopped him, he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “They were in front of me and they ran into me and at that time I believed that they will were going to attack me.” 
         
        
       
     69 Asked whether he had run towards the deceased and his brother he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “No I did not run into them but they ran into me.” 
         
        
       
     70 Asked whether he had sought to find his acquaintance he said he had tried but that he did not dare go to Cabramatta because he was afraid that Phat and his people might take revenge against him. 
      
       
     71 The following cross-examination took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. See, Mr Le, you were quite upset, weren’t you, when you were confronted on this day. Weren’t you upset? A. No, I was very scared. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You had a fight with Phat the day before, didn’t you? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you weren’t scared of Phat, were you? A. But when they approached me and particularly with weapons, I was very scared of them. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. See, what I am suggesting to you is that the only weapon they had, the brothers, initially, was the pipe? A. That is not correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Your friend, the man with you, had a knife? A. I don’t know whether or not the other man that you are talking about had a weapon or a knife, but I had the weapon that I picked up, as I told you. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you picked it up because you had put it there previously, hadn’t you? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you were perfectly willing to engage in a confrontation with the deceased and his brother, weren’t you? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I am suggesting you weren’t scared at all? A. I was very scared. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You ran over and got stuck into the deceased? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. After he was stabbed you and your friends kicked him on the ground, didn’t you? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Then you ran away and disposed of the weapon? A. As soon as Tuan fell down, everybody stopped and I ran away.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. And later on you ran from the police? A. Yes.” 
         
        
        
       Summing up 
        
       
     72 McClellan J gave the jury a set of written directions. He referred to its containing seven pages though the document in the record MFI 5 consisted of six. The last page which is missing from the document MFI was described by his Honour as a page “dealing with the result which seeks to explain to you the outcomes that are possible and the questions you will be asked and the role that your foreperson plays in answering those questions.” The six pages in MFI 5 were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Murder – By an Act of the Accused 
         
        
        
         
         (1) Murder is established if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the deceased dies as a result of the deliberate act of the accused and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the act was done - 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) with an intention to kill the deceased, 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (ii) with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm upon him, and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) the act was not done in self-defence. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) If the Crown fails to prove any of (a) or (b) or (c) above, beyond reasonable doubt, the Crown has failed to establish murder by an act of the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         Murder – Joint Enterprise 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Murder is also established if the accused, did not commit the act which killed the deceased but nevertheless the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the act causing death was done by another pursuant to an agreement or understanding with the accused to attack the deceased, other than in self-defence, where the accused contemplated that the other person might use a knife with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm or causing death, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the act causing death was not done in self-defence. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (4) If the Crown fails to prove either (a) or (b) above beyond reasonable doubt the Crown has failed to establish murder on the joint enterprise basis. 
         
        
        
         
         Grievous bodily harm 
         
        
        
         
         (5) Grievous bodily harm means really serious injury. 
         
        
        
         
         Self-defence 
         
        
        
         
         (6) An act is done in self-defence if -  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the accused believed that it was necessary in his own defence to do the act, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) there were reasonable grounds for that belief. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (7) The Crown may establish that the accused’s act was  
         not 
          done in self-defence by satisfying you beyond reasonable doubt that (a) above was not so or that (b) above was not so. 
         
        
        
         
         Manslaughter – By an Act of the Accused 
         
        
        
         
         (8) If the accused is guilty of murder, you do not proceed any further. The question of manslaughter only arises if the accused is not guilty of murder. 
         
        
        
         
         (9) The accused is not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter if and only if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) it was a deliberate act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the act was unlawful and dangerous, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) the act was not done in self-defence. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (10) If the Crown fails to establish any of (a), or (b) or (c) above, beyond reasonable doubt, the Crown has failed to establish manslaughter by an act of the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         Manslaughter – Joint Enterprise 
         
        
        
         
         (11) Manslaughter may also be established if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the act which caused the death of the deceased was done by another pursuant to an agreement or understanding with the accused to apply violence to the deceased by use of a knife, other than in self-defence, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) it was a deliberate act of the other which caused the death of the deceased, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) the act was unlawful and dangerous, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) the act was not done in self-defence. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (12) If the Crown fails to establish any of (a) or (b) or (c) or (d) above, beyond reasonable doubt, the Crown has failed to establish manslaughter on the joint enterprise basis. 
         
        
        
         
         (13) An act is unlawful if it involves a deliberate application of force to another person without that person’s consent. 
         
        
        
         
         (14) An act is dangerous if it is such that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that, by the act, the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable (or significant) risk of serious injury.” 
         
        
       
     73 The trial Judge later made amendments to the document that had been handed to the jury which were incorporated in MFI 5. His Honour emphasised that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act causing death was not done in self-defence. His Honour stated the following legal principles in relation to self-defence: 
      
       
        
         
         “They are these: Firstly, you should approach this topic in a practical manner and without undue nicety, giving proper weight to the predicament of the accused, if it afforded little or any opportunity for calm deliberation. 
         
        
        
         
         I will come back later to look at the precise evidence of the accused in relation to this matter. It is obviously very important. But you will remember generally how he tells us that he was sitting with his friend when he was approached by the deceased and his brother. He tells us that he believed that he was being threatened by them, that they were carrying weapons and he tells us that he acted, firstly, to go away and when he was unable to achieve that, he called up from his memory the weapon which he then held apparently during the course of the fight. But it is important that you bring to mind that evidence when you consider the predicament faced by the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         A person defending himself or herself from an attack or a threatened attack, who may believe that there is a need to act instantly, cannot be expected to weigh carefully what measures of self defensive action are called for. That is the first point of the principle. 
         
        
        
         
         The second point is this. When it comes to reasonableness, it is the accused’s state of mind that has to be evaluated and not that of some hypothetical, reasonable person in the position of the accused. The question is whether this accused person did not believe, on reasonable grounds, that it was necessary to do what he did. You do not put yourselves in his shoes and ask what would I have thought and done. You take, as a given, what the accused believed or may have believed. If he believed or he may have believed that it was necessary to do what he did in self-defence, you ask yourself whether you are satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there were reasonable grounds for that belief. 
         
        
        
         
         The third matter is this: the threat does not ordinarily call for a response which involves an intention to kill or to cause really serious injury unless the threat causes a reasonable apprehension of death or of serious bodily harm. If the response of the accused went beyond what he believed to be necessary in order to defend himself or if there were no reasonable grounds for a belief, on his part, that the response was necessary in order to defend himself, then the action was not one of self-defence. 
         
        
        
         
         The fourth matter is that there is no rule that the force used by the accused must be no more than was proportionate to the threat. It may be relevant to consider whether the accused must have believed that what he did went beyond the bounds of what was necessary. You ask whether the Crown has established that the accused did not believe, on reasonable grounds, that what he did was necessary. I repeat, there is no rule that the accused’s act must not be disproportionate to the threat. The question is whether you are satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused, in the circumstances in which he found himself, did not believe that what he did was necessary in self-defence or that there were no reasonable grounds for such a belief. If you are not so satisfied, the verdict must be returned of not guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         Fifthly, there is no rule either that the person under attack must retreat, if they can, before attempting to defend themselves by an act intended to kill or to cause really serious injury to an assailant. If there is a real opportunity to retreat, that is one aspect of the total consideration. It is one consideration among a totality of considerations. The question is this: Given the opportunity to retreat, if there was one, are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe, on reasonable grounds, that it was necessary to do what he did, rather than retreat. And again we will come to it later, but I remind you at this stage of the evidence which the accused gave of his initial attempts to walk away and how he was obstructed and could not take that course. 
         
        
        
         
         Sixthly, the accused’s mental state includes the effect which you think what had gone on, on the previous day, was likely to have had on him. You will remember that on the previous day there had been a fight between the accused and Phat Quoc Nguyen, which the accused apparently won. There is no dispute that on the subsequent day the initial approach to the accused was made by the deceased. The accused tells you that he perceived this approach as a threat. As I indicated, we will discuss the evidence in detail later, but you are entitled to have regard to those circumstances, as indeed you must, when considering the mental state which would have occurred within the accused when he was approached on that day. 
         
        
        
         
         So that deals with the question of self-defence.” 
         
        
        
       These directions were not challenged on the appeal. 
        
       
     74 In accordance with these directions it is apparent from the jury verdict of manslaughter that the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act was not done in self-defence.  
      
       
     75 His Honour said, after referring to joint criminal enterprise and giving some examples: 
      
       
        
         
         “In this case the Crown suggests that if the accused did not himself stab the deceased, he was engaged in a joint enterprise with the acquaintance with whom he was sitting outside the Chinese restaurant. Before you could find that there was a common enterprise between the accused and this person, you would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such an enterprise existed and, otherwise, you would then have to address the matters on the second sheet which we have just looked at.” 
         
        
       
     76 The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt either that it was the appellant’s deliberate act which caused the deceased’s death and that the act was not done in self-defence or, if the deceased was stabbed by another person, that that was a deliberate act and not in self-defence but done pursuant to an agreement or understanding with the appellant to apply violence to the deceased by use of a knife other than in self-defence. 
      
       
        
       Grounds of Appeal 
        
       
     77 Ground 17 was that the trial Judge erred in finding there was sufficient evidence to leave a case of common purpose to the jury. It is convenient to deal with this ground first having regard to what had been said in his Honour’s directions about joint enterprise. His Honour called for and heard submissions at the end of which he said that he would allow the Crown to put joint enterprise (T481). I must say and with due respect there seems to be but the slenderest evidence that the appellant was engaged in a joint enterprise with the acquaintance with whom he was sitting outside the Chinese restaurant, or with any other person, that any such person was armed with a knife and that there was anything in the nature of an agreement or understanding between such person and the appellant to apply violence to the deceased by use of a knife. However, it is not necessary, as will appear, that I examine this question further. 
      
       
     78 Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that this Court on any appeal under s5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal 
      
       
        
         
         “if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice; and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.” 
         
        
       
     79 In M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-3 Mason CJ and Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ considered the relationship between a conclusion that a verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and the language of s6(1). Their Honours said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Where a court of criminal appeal sets aside a verdict on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, it frequently does so expressing its conclusion in terms of a verdict which is unsafe or unsatisfactory. Other terms may be used such as ‘unjust or unsafe’, or ‘dangerous or unsafe’. In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ‘none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand’. But a verdict may be unsafe or unsatisfactory for reasons which lie outside the formula requiring that it not be ‘unreasonable’ or incapable of being ‘supported having regard to the evidence’. A verdict which is unsafe or unsatisfactory for any other reason must also constitute a miscarriage of justice requiring the verdict to be set aside. In speaking of the  
         Criminal Appeal Act 
          in  
         Hargan v The King  
         (1919) 27 CLR 13 at 23, Isaacs J said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘If [the appellant] can show a miscarriage of justice, that is sufficient. That is the greatest innovation made by the Act, and to lose sight of that is to miss the point of the legislative advance.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         And as the Court observed in  
         Davies and Cody v The King  
         (1937) 57 CLR 170 at 180, the duty imposed on a court of appeal to quash a conviction when it thinks that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice covers: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘not only cases where there is affirmative reason to suppose that the appellant is innocent, but also cases of quite another description. For it will set aside a conviction whenever it appears unjust or unsafe to allow the verdict to stand because some failure has occurred in observing the conditions which, in the court’s view, are essential to a satisfactory trial, or because there is some feature of the case raising a substantial possibility that, either in the conclusion itself, or in the manner in which it has been reached, the jury may have been mistaken or misled.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” 
         
        
       
     80 In Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106 Callinan J said at 164, after quoting the above passage: 
      
       
        
         
         “So long as the ground that the verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory is truly raised it is now accordingly well settled that a court of appeal should undertake ‘an independent examination of the relevant evidence to determine whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused’. [citations omitted] 
         
        
        
         
         It almost goes without saying that the independent assessment of the relevant evidence has to be made in the context of the whole trial, including rulings on evidence and directions to the jury.” 
         
        
       
     81 In Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ, who formed the majority of the Court, said at 452 that the test formulated by the majority in M must now be accepted as the appropriate test for determining whether a verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory. 
      
       
     82 In Gipp McHugh and Hayne JJ, who dissented, said at 123: 
      
       
        
         
         “A criminal trial under the common law system remains today, as it has been for many centuries, based on the theory that it is an adversarial contest between the Crown and the accused. Each party gathers its own evidence, tenders its own evidence and cross-examines the evidence of the opposite party. Each party selects the grounds upon which it relies and argues them without assistance from the court. For its part and subject to statutory exceptions, the court’s role is generally limited to determining what legal rules govern the issues selected by the parties and whether the evidence and contentions of the parties are within those rules.” 
         
        
       
     83 The first two grounds of appeal were that the trial miscarried and the verdict of the jury was unreasonable in all the circumstances. It is convenient to return later to those grounds of appeal. 
      
       
     84 Grounds 3, 4, 5 and 6 can be taken together. They were: 
      
       
        
         
         “3. The trial Judge erred in failing to reject the evidence of identification of the accused given by the witness Banks. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The trial Judge erred in failing to discharge the jury immediately on the giving of identification evidence by the witness Banks. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The trial Judge erred in failing to immediately direct the jury as to how they should regard the evidence of Banks. 
         
        
        
         
         6. The trial Judge erred in the directions he gave of identification in relation to Banks.” 
         
        
       
     85 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that, in view of the following facts: 
      
       
        
         
         - Banks had not previously identified the accused; 
         
        
        
         
         - he did not identify the accused in examination in chief; 
         
        
        
         
         - his identification of the accused came in cross-examination; 
         
        
        
         
         - his positive incorrect identification of the knife, namely that the accused was the one holding the knife which stabbed the deceased; 
         
        
        
         
         - the speed with which the events occurred affecting his identification; 
         
        
        
         
         - the fact that his identification was more than twelve months after the events and whilst the accused was in the dock; 
         
        
        
         
         - he gave a very limited description in examination in chief of the persons involved; 
         
        
        
       the evidence of Mr Banks should have been rejected or the jury discharged. 
        
       
     86 Mr Banks identified the appellant in answer to a direct question from the appellant’s counsel: “You know who had the knife. Who was that?” Such a question carried high risk. Counsel no doubt thought that Mr Banks would identify somebody other than his client, the appellant. Had he done so he would have significantly improved the appellant’s chance of an acquittal. The answer he got was possible though unexpected. A decision then had to be made whether to cross-examine further by pressing Mr Banks on his failure previously to identify the appellant as the person who had the knife with which the deceased was stabbed, the lateness of the identification twelve months after the events and the very limited description Mr Banks had given in chief of the person with the knife. Such cross-examination may have demonstrated that the answer was false or unreliable. But it involved further risk that Mr Banks would stand by his evidence and the jury would accept it. Counsel preferred to make these points about the unreliability of the evidence in argument rather than by cross-examination. Such decisions are part and parcel of the adversarial contest. Counsel did not seek any immediate direction, no doubt not wishing to emphasise the significance of the answer.  
      
       
     87 Had the evidence of identification by Mr Banks been led by the Crown and had there been no other identification of the appellant as the person who stabbed the accused the trial Judge may have been justified in discharging the jury; see R v Saxon (1998) 1 VR 503 at 513. But the evidence was led by counsel for the appellant in an attempt to exclude the appellant as the person who had stabbed the accused. If that risk is run by counsel with the legitimate intention of getting an acquittal I do not think an unexpected answer entitles the accused to have the answer taken from the jury or the jury discharged. However, as Mason J said in Alexander v The Queen (1981) 145 CLR 395 at 427, a court or dock identification is of little probative value when made by a witness who has no prior knowledge of the accused; see also JD Heydon, Cross on Evidence, 6th Australian ed (2000) at 1410.  
      
       
     88 In the course of his directions to the jury in summing up, when dealing with this evidence of identification by Mr Banks, McClellan J twice said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It will be apparent to you that evidence of identification of the accused as the person committing the crime, when he has obviously been identified by others and is on his trial, should be approached with the greatest of caution.” 
         
        
       
     89 His Honour was directing attention to what Mason J in Alexander at 427 called “the trial circumstances (which) conspire to compel the witness to identify the accused in the dock”. Counsel for the appellant claimed that what his Honour suggested was that the appellant had been identified by others as the person who had stabbed the deceased. However counsel at the trial apparently did not so understand the expressions and sought no redirection. I am not persuaded that any part of McClellan J’s direction on this identification by Mr Banks calls for the Court to intervene. This passage aside, it was unexceptionable. 
      
       
     90 In my opinion, these grounds of appeal standing alone should be rejected. 
      
       
     91 Grounds 8, 9, 10 and 13 were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “8. The trial Judge erred in failing to discharge the jury when the witness Phat Nguyen became unavailable. 
         
        
        
         
         9. The trial Judge erred in exercise of his discretion in permitting the statements of Phat Nguyen to be read to the jury. 
         
        
        
         
         10. The trial Judge erred in failing to give the jury a warning pursuant to s165  
         Evidence Act 
          immediately after the statements of Phat Nguyen were read to the jury. 
         
        
        
         
         13. The trial Judge erred in failing to withdraw the evidence of Phat Nguyen from the jury at the close of the Crown case.” 
         
        
       
     92 It was accepted that each statement was “a prescribed written statement” within the meaning of s116(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The requirements of subs (2) were met. Proof on oath was available that Phat Nguyen was absent from Australia and for that reason not able to give oral evidence. McClellan J admitted both statements and at a later stage when the other prosecution evidence had been led refused to take them away from the jury. He took account of s137 of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
     93 His Honour accepted, I think correctly, that the probative value of the statement was significantly reduced by the non-availability of Phat Nguyen for cross-examination; see Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297. At 323, McHugh J referred to the definition in the Dictionary of the Evidence Act of “probative value” as being “the extent to which evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue”. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “That assessment, of course, would necessarily involve considerations of reliability … An assessment of probative value, however, must always depend on the circumstances of the particular case at hand.” 
         
        
       
     94 Such an approach is one more favourable to the appellant than that adopted by Hunt CJ at CL in Carusi  v R (1997) 92 A Crim R 52 at 66. His Honour said that the power of the trial judge to exclude evidence in accordance with the Christie discretion does not permit the judge, in assessing what its probative value is, to determine whether the jury should or should not accept the evidence. 
      
       
     95 In Papakosmas at 325-6 McHugh J referred to Gordon (Bankrupt) Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Pike (No 1) (Federal Court of Australia, 1 September 1995, unreported) and Commonwealth of Australia v McLean (1996) 41 NSWLR 389 at 401-402 where courts have exercised their discretion to exclude transcript or hearsay evidence because of the resultant inability of a party to cross-examine the maker of the representation on a crucial issue or otherwise effectively challenged the evidence. McHugh J observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is unnecessary to express a concluded opinion on the correctness of these decisions, although I am inclined to think that the learned judges have been too much influenced by the common law attitude to hearsay evidence, have not given sufficient weight to the change that the Act has brought about in making hearsay evidence admissible to prove facts in issue, and have not given sufficient weight to the traditional meaning of ‘prejudice’ in a context of rejecting evidence for discretionary reasons.” 
         
        
       
     96 The non-availability of Phat Nguyen for cross-examination was at the same time a matter of prejudice to the appellant. The balance was not an easy one to judge. But the mere fact that the evidence was contrary to the appellant’s case, while in a sense “prejudicial”, does not amount to unfair prejudice. In R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139 Hunt CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The prejudice to which each of the sections (ss 135, 136 and 137) refers is  
         not 
          that the evidence merely tends to establish the Crown case; it means prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way.” 
         
        
       
     97 I am not persuaded that at any stage McClellan J erred in admitting the statements or in refusing to take them away from the jury. As I have already indicated counsel for the appellant, for reasons related to an argument of self-defence, agreed at various stages to the admission of the statements and to their not being taken away from the jury. The trial Judge directed the jury that it would be dangerous to convict the appellant relying only on the evidence of Phat Nguyen. This was an appropriate direction sufficient for the case. In my opinion, these grounds of appeal standing alone should fail.  
      
       
     98 It is appropriate now to return to grounds 1 and 2. The jury saw and heard the appellant’s evidence. From the transcript on its face the appellant seemed to give his evidence frankly. He did not attempt to hide that he was present at the fight and had a knife and ran away when the deceased fell to the ground. There was no attempt to improve his position by saying that he did not have a knife in his hand or more importantly that he did not strike the deceased with it. These critical parts of his evidence “I’m not sure. It is possible that my weapon came in contact with someone but it happened very quickly, so I don’t remember” and, in answer to the question “When the deceased fell down, you were there with a knife?”, “Yes, I was there, but I cannot deny or admit that I was responsible” were forthright and not self-serving.  
      
       
     99 The evidence identifying the appellant as the person who stabbed the deceased was the oral testimony of Mr Banks and the untested statements of Phat Nguyen. Mr Banks’ evidence was of little weight in the circumstances in which it was given. In Davies & Cody v The King  at 182 the High Court said: 
      
       
        
         
         “…if a witness whose previous knowledge of the accused man has not made him familiar with his appearance has been shown the accused alone as a suspect and has on that occasion first identified him, the liability to mistake is so increased as to make it unsafe to convict the accused unless his identity is further proved by other evidence direct or circumstantial.” 
         
        
       
     100 As the trial Judge pointed out to the jury it would be dangerous for them to convict on the statements of Phat Nguyen if they stood alone uncorroborated. Phat Nguyen did not like the appellant, had been involved in a fight with him the day before and was the brother of the deceased. He was not an impartial and objective bystander but a person who had motive falsely to accuse the appellant. There was the independent statement that Mr Tu, according to his evidence, an idle spectator of the fight, had been identified as the person disposing of a knife shortly after the fight. In several respects the evidence of Phat Nguyen was inconsistent with or unsupported by other evidence both as to the nature of the fight, in which he took part, and what he did when his brother fell to the ground. No one else suggested that after his brother went down Phat Nguyen remained to look after him. All the other evidence suggested that he ran away immediately.  
      
       
     101 Even though, if the jury rejected as it did, the whole or part of the appellant’s evidence, there was evidence upon which the jury could convict, nonetheless, in my opinion, it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the conviction to stand. I pay full regard to the consideration that the jury was the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence and had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses.  
      
       
     102 It is not inappropriate at this point to refer to ground 18 of the grounds of appeal and the cross-examination which I have set out of the appellant which tended to suggest that he had come to Cabramatta on 23 February 2000 and on other occasions for no good or legitimate reason. In the circumstances of this case and the slight evidence that the appellant had stabbed the deceased, the prejudice from such a cross-examination, which seems to me to have been entirely irrelevant except as to credit, was significant. Section 104(2) of the Evidence Act provides that in a criminal proceeding a defendant must not be cross-examined about a matter that is relevant only because it is relevant to the defendant’s credibility, unless the court gives leave. No such leave was sought or given.  
      
       
     103 In my opinion the appellant has established that the conviction was unreasonable and involved a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, it should be quashed. 
      
       
     104 It is not necessary that I say anything about grounds 7, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16 which were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “7. The trial judge erred in refusing to rule on the effect of cross-examination in raising character. 
         
        
        
         
         11. The trial judge erred in permitting further examination and cross-examination of the witness Carzo. 
         
        
        
         
         12. The trial judge erred in failing to give the jury a s165  
         Evidence Act 
          warning in respect to the evidence of the witness Murrell at the time or later. 
         
        
        
         
         14. The trial judge erred in failing to discharge the jury at the close of the Crown case. 
         
        
        
         
         15. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury of their right to then bring in a verdict of acquittal at the close of the Crown case. 
         
        
        
         
         16. The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to re-open its case.” 
         
        
        
       nor is it necessary to say anything about the sentence imposed. 
        
       
     105 Ground 19 was that the appellant was incompetently represented. Counsel’s instructions were that the appellant took part in the fight with a knife in his hand and that one of his opponents in the fight was the deceased. The appellant and the deceased and the deceased’s brother were not on good terms. In those circumstances it is not surprising that counsel considered the best hope for acquittal was self-defence. One element of this defence was evidence that the deceased and his brother carried weapons. Counsel no doubt expected that Phat Nguyen would give evidence which would support that conclusion and could be cross-examined to show that he and his brother attacked the appellant. In a sense this was an all or nothing defence, acquittal if the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the stabbing was not in self-defence, conviction if the jury was so satisfied.  
      
       
     106 To make good this defence, Phat Nguyen’s evidence needed to be admitted. The choice of aborting the hearing, once Phat Nguyen was not available to give oral evidence, was contrary to counsel’s instructions to get the trial over with and involved some risk if Phat Nguyen turned out to be a good witness able to persuade the jury that the appellant was the attacker. The choice was a difficult one but it was not unreasonable in the circumstances to allow the matter to proceed on Phat Nguyen’s statement knowing that in so far as that implicated the appellant as the person with the knife it was of less weight if the deponent was not available to give evidence. 
      
       
     107 In dealing with the identification evidence of Mr Banks, counsel ran a risk but it was justified by the possibility, reasonably to be expected, that Mr Banks would identify the knife carrier as someone other than the accused. Identifying the appellant as the knife carrier while unhelpful in terms of obtaining an acquittal other than on self-defence was not necessarily harmful to that defence. The identification in court of the appellant would be treated as of little weight. An answer that the person carrying the knife was not the appellant would have left only the statement of Phat Nguyen as evidence implicating him as the stabber. The chance of acquittal was far higher. 
      
       
     108 Too often, if an accused is convicted, the transcript is carefully scrutinised by new counsel away from the heat of the battle and blame for alleged failures to obtain rulings or call evidence is laid at the trial counsel’s door and incompetency asserted. I am not impressed by this ground of appeal.  
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     109 In my opinion, the following orders should be made: 
      
       
        
         
         1. Appeal upheld; 
         
        
        
         
         2. Verdict of 15 March 2001 quashed; 
         
        
        
         
         3. Direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered. 
         
        
       
     110 LEVINE J: I agree with Sheller JA. 
      
       
     111 SIMPSON J: I agree with Sheller JA.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney for the crime of indecent assault on a male. That crime was said to have been committed between 1 January 1980 and 31 October 1980, some 21 or more years ago. 
      
       
     2 The maximum penalty then existing for that offence was five years penal servitude. The section providing for that offence has now been repealed. 
      
       
     3 On 25 February 2002, the learned trial judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for three years and six months, commencing on 25 February 2002 (the day on which the offender first went into custody for this offence) and expiring on 24 August 2005. He imposed a non-parole period in respect of that sentence of two years six months, expiring on 24 August 2004. 
      
       
     4 The applicant had been charged by information and summons and served on 24 February 2001. He was committed for trial and granted unconditional bail thereafter. 
      
       
     5 He is a man of considerable prior record. In 1956 he had been convicted of offences of indecent assault and buggery and that resulted in a sentence totalling five years penal servitude. In 1988 he was convicted in the Local Court of assault a person under sixteen with an act of indecency and received the benefit of a s.558 recognisance for three years. 
      
       
     6 In 1995 he was convicted of various acts of gross indecency with a male person and breach of that recognisance and received various fixed term sentences, together with a sentence of some 21 months imprisonment. His sentences in total were to expire in the year 2000, although a minimum term, concurrent with the fixed terms, was provided. Later, there was a variation of the commencement date of those sentences in the CCA. 
      
       
     7 In 1999 he received a community service order without conditions for 150 hours for the offence of assault with an act of indecency. 
      
       
     8 This matter went forward before the trial judge on the basis that, as was submitted in the short submissions filed on his behalf, he is a person who has been a homosexual paedophile throughout his adult life. He was aged, however, 73 years at the date at which he came forward for sentence. 
      
       
     9 The offences for which he came forward for sentence were committed by him on a foster son, and had not come to light until well after the applicant commenced serving the prison sentences that had given rise to the application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal to which I have referred. Those charges did not relate to this complainant. 
      
       
     10 The short facts appear to have been, that the applicant fondled the genitals of his then 12 year old foster son whilst the boy was in the bath. It was only after the complainant, who had moved interstate, informed the police of those events that action was taken in respect of them, and the applicant was first spoken to by police in relation to these matters after his release from gaol after serving the sentences in respect of which he had appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
      
       
     11 Had the matters come to light any earlier, it may well have been that they could have been dealt with at the same time as the earlier matters. 
      
       
     12 Whilst in prison serving the sentences for those matters, the applicant has involved himself in counselling and psychosexual education courses. Upon his release, he has attended a further group course for sex offenders, run by the Child Abuse Protection Service. He has also seen Professor McConaghy, psychiatrist, at the Australian Centre for Sexual Health at Potts Point, for ongoing psychiatric treatment. 
      
       
     13 He has been referred by Professor McConaghy to Dr. O’Dea, a forensic psychiatrist, for further psychiatric treatment. He informed the psychiatrists that he had been desperately trying to seek help for his homosexual paedophilia for many years, and it was not until he was in custody that he first received counselling assistance. 
      
       
     14 Dr. O’Dea, having seen the applicant on a regular basis, commenced the applicant on a regime of Androcur in January 1999, and the effect of that medication was to lower his testosterone level to reduce his sexual drive. The consequence is that the applicant, at age 74, apparently is no longer troubled by intrusive or persistent sexual thoughts about young boys. 
      
       
     15 The applicant had continued to see Dr. O’Dea up until the time of his sentencing, and has continued to take the medication. The applicant, in addition, had, prior to his sentences for this offence, involved himself in church activities and was receiving regular counselling from the senior pastor at his church, spending considerable time involved in that counselling and church attendance, at either a North Coast church or at Inverell or Moree. 
      
       
     16 When the learned trial judge came to sentence, he recorded that the applicant had been accorded the full benefit of an early plea, accompanied by a finding in the applicant's favour of contrition. 
      
       
     17 His Honour, however, noted the evidence before him that it was undisputed that the type of incident for which the applicant came forward for sentence on this charge occurred on a regular basis, probably 15 times, and always while the child was in the bath. 
      
       
     18 His Honour relied on that matter to eliminate suggestions which he said, had ""not been put forward” that this was an isolated event. His Honour had regard to the Victim Impact Statement, as available to him, to recognise the effect the offence had on the victim. His Honour found that this misconduct would be likely to have an adverse psychological effect on the victim and that it had that effect in this case. 
      
       
     19 His Honour referred to the applicant’s time in prison for the offences to which I have referred. He refers to the circumstances which enabled this matter to be raised. He accepted that a matter in mitigation arose from the offender admitting so early after the mater had come to light his involvement in the offence, when first charged with it by Margaret, his wife, and concluded that there was some degree of contrition meriting consideration, but referred to a circumstance causing him some difficulty with those matters. 
      
       
     20 His Honour said, there were, “In cases such as this, components of manipulation which make one hesitant to accept contrition”. Those remarks appear to be general in nature rather than as referring to any particular matter in evidence in this case. His Honour appears to have been concerned with the genuineness of contrition as evidenced at a time when re-offending might have been in contemplation rather than to contrition at the time of a plea of guilty or sentencing over 20 years later. Thus, his Honour refers to that manipulation as relating to an offender placing himself in circumstances whereby they would have contact with young boys with whom they could interfere. 
      
       
     21 His Honour accepts there is here some measure of contrition and relates that the making of the plea of guilty. However, I find his Honour’s reasoning in this regard and, particularly concerning the reference to manipulation, as somehow relating to a discounting of contrition, somewhat difficult to follow. That said, however, it is apparent that his Honour did give some benefit to the applicant on account of his contrition. 
      
       
     22 Again, when considering possible leniency, his Honour appears not to have had regard to the efforts that the applicant has made to achieve rehabilitation and the efforts he has made to undergo the medication regime as matters relating to the offender's state of mind. But his Honour turned to those matters, following the reference to contrition, in the context of dealing with the balancing of the various purposes of punishment, ie., as relating to protection of the community. 
      
       
     23 His Honour characterised the offence as being a grave one, lying towards the higher end of the range for this kind of misconduct. He referred to the breach of trust and the vulnerability of the victim. 
      
       
     24 His Honour sentenced having regard to the maximum as provided by the law as it operated at the time of the existence of the relevant crime and concluded that a sentence should be imposed towards the top of the range for this kind of abuse. In that regard it must be mentioned that his Honour did not otherwise than as I have described detail any facts which might tend to place the matter within a higher range or lower range of offence. 
      
       
     25 He noted that there was no rigid guidance as to the kind of penalty to be imposed, but referred to the necessity for it to reflect deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution. He concluded that although retribution, in some circumstances, might be inappropriate, pointless, or just cruel, the fact that the applicant was in his seventies, alone, should not cause a sentencing judge to desist from imposing an appropriate sentence. His Honour regarded it as relevant that in his view the victim had ""not simply slept on his rights"". 
      
       
     26 This, however, is not a matter involving victim’s rights, nor a matter in which the delay in the matter coming forward should be treated as somehow reflecting adversely on the victim. It is a matter, however, in which there have been many years since the offence, and that lapse of time and what has occurred in it does have to be taken into account when considering what is the appropriate course to take. His Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “This is not a case of someone wilfully or wantonly walking out of ancient history in order to punish somebody”. 
         
        
       
     27 I do not find for myself, that observation helpful, since it could not in any way be suggested that that observation might apply to the victim in this matter. His Honour did advert to the applicant having not himself volunteered a clean breast of his misbehaviour at an earlier point of time, indeed, in the early 1980s, and he does appear to have placed some significance on the applicant having not come forward with it in 1980. 
      
       
     28 Consequently, his Honour concluded that he did not see anything in the circumstances of the long lapse of time which would diminish the appropriateness of punishing this man. His Honour concludes that there is necessity for personal deterrence and general deterrence. He adverts to rehabilitation, but seems to have regard to that in the context of the problem of the compulsive effect of the applicant’s feelings. In particular, he relates the matter of rehabilitation to the drug regime and without having reference to matters adverted to in the decision of the High Court in Dinsdale v. The Queen (2000) 175 ALR 315 concerning suspending a sentence looked to what was said in that decision dealing with protection of the community. Thus, his Honour came to determine the length of the head sentence to be passed. 
      
       
     29 His Honour then considered whether he should decline to state a non-parole period. He dealt with the repetitive nature of the applicant's misconduct over the years and the prior matters to which I have referred, he had regard to them as tending to incline him not to give the applicant the benefit of a parole period but in the upshot concluded that he should impose a non-parole period. 
      
       
     30 His Honour then concluded that there were special circumstances in the need for the regime of drug treatment to be continued and monitored, so that the length of that period need not reflect the statutory proportion but recommended that there be no release to parole unless Androcur or some other treatment regime continued in place. 
      
       
     31 He further recommended that the applicant be placed in strict protection and that steps be taken to protect him against self-harm. At no point did his Honour have regard to those matters as providing for a sentence shorter than it might otherwise be notwithstanding that the sentencing regime for the applicant would be far more onerous than other prisoners would have to undergo. Nor did his Honour have regard to the age of the prisoner in that respect. 
      
       
     32 The submission that is made in respect of the sentences imposed by his Honour, although it refers to his Honour allegedly falling into error in failing to have proper regard to matters of rehabilitation and contrition, to my mind, achieves much more significance when one turns to consider whether the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     33 It is apparent from what I have said, when reviewing the sentences imposed by his Honour, that his Honour to a great extent disregarded the delay in the matter coming forward to be dealt with, and that the prior criminality and sentences of the accused seem to have been regarded in a manner which seems to suggest that his Honour valued them as somehow requiring a longer sentence than might otherwise have been imposed notwithstanding they were imposed long after this crime and they were the occasion for the rehabilitative efforts of the offender to which I have referred. 
      
       
     34 When I review the whole of the circumstances here, notwithstanding the capable submissions of the Crown, that this is a matter which should attract a deterrent and retributive sentence and the sentences should be upheld, so that it is submitted the offences will remain adequately denounced to the community, I do not conclude that in all the circumstances of this case a sentence of two years imprisonment would fail to achieve those objectives. 
      
       
     35 Nor do I conclude that it would have been inappropriate, or that it is inappropriate for that sentence to be suspended upon condition that the offender enter into a recognisance conditioned upon him accepting the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and such psychiatric supervision and assistance as that Service might direct, including maintaining or embarking on a regime of prescribed medication. 
      
       
     36 The applicant has presently been in custody since February this year, and has served a custodial portion of any such sentence. 
      
       
     37 I would propose that the sentences that have been passed upon the applicant below be quashed, and in lieu, the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for two years and that sentence to be wholly suspended upon the applicant entering into a recognisance, pursuant to s.12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, self in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour and containing a specific term that the applicant accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and obey all reasonable directions of that Service, including submitting himself to psychiatric treatment and to maintain or embark on such prescribed drug regime as his psychiatrist may deem appropriate. 
      
       
     38 CARRUTHERS, AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     39 GREG JAMES, J: The orders will therefore be that the application for leave is granted, the appeal is upheld, the sentence imposed below is quashed and in lieu the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for two years to be suspended on his entering into a recognisance conditioned as I have proposed. The suspended sentence will date from today. The recognisance may be entered into before any magistrate.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HIDDEN J: The appellant was tried in the District Court upon an indictment containing three counts of homosexual intercourse, one count of attempted homosexual intercourse and two counts of committing an act of gross indecency with a male person. He was found guilty of those counts and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. He appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
      
       
     2 Given the view I have taken of the outcome of this matter, it is unnecessary to recite the allegations in the Crown case. It is sufficient to say that the appellant was the stepfather of the complainant, the three counts of homosexual intercourse were allegations of fellatio performed by the appellant upon the complainant; the count of attempted homosexual intercourse was an allegation of attempted anal penetration, and the counts of committing an act of gross indecency were allegations that the appellant placed his penis, in effect, between the thighs of the complainant. 
      
       
     3 The first count arose from an event said to have occurred late in 1986. The counts are then sequential in time, and the last count is in relation to an event said to have occurred in early 1992. No complaint was made until 1997, when the complainant complained to his mother about the appellant’s conduct. Accordingly, from the time of the event the subject of the first count some eleven years have passed until the first complaint, while five and a half years have passed between the time of the event the subject of the last count and that complaint. The complaint to the police was made in 1998. 
      
       
     4 A number of grounds of appeal have been filed and have been addressed in written submissions. The argument today is centred upon the first of them and it asserts that the learned trial judge’s directions to the jury about delay in complaint were inadequate. In the view I have formed, that ground is made out and is such that the convictions must be quashed. What his Honour had to say about that matter is this: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is one other warning I have got to give you, and that is the evidence has been given in these trials of events that are alleged to have occurred in about 1986 onwards to 1992. Some fourteen years ago, when the complainant was in late primary school and early high school according to the complainant. Time has made it difficult for witnesses to completely recall circumstances and details. Memories can fluctuate and fade over such a period of time quite obviously, as can be seen in the witnesses called on behalf of the Crown including the mother who says she could not being her mind exactly when these things occurred. As can be seen, as I say, perhaps leaves scope for the dishonest if there be any, and no complaint was made until 1998. Investigation has been made difficult by this delay, not only for the Crown but also for the accused, to find witnesses and records and the like. 
         
        
        
         
         These matters may lead to a situation in which the evidence may be unreliable for a number of reasons. One, the age of the witnesses at the time, the period of time that I have referred to, that has elapsed and the interference occasioned to both sides to fully investigate, all may contribute. I say may be unreliable, not must be. You should carefully consider the factors that I have mentioned when assessing the evidence and the witnesses and the weight to be given to the evidence of the various witnesses.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     5 His Honour had earlier in the summing up given the conventional direction arising from the fact that the evidence of the complainant was uncorroborated and required to be scrutinised with care. 
      
       
     6 Directions by a trial judge in cases such as this, where there has been significant delay between allegation and complaint, were considered by the High Court in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79. Before us, the Crown accepts that what has now become known as a Longman direction was called for in the present case. No doubt it is a Longman direction which his Honour set out to give. The only question for us is its adequacy in the circumstances of this case. 
      
       
     7 Longman was recently revisited by the High Court in Crampton v The Queen (2000) 176 ALR 369 and Doggett v The Queen (2001) 182 ALR 1. It must be said that the High Court’s decision in Crampton was very recent at the time of the trial the subject of this appeal and, of course, that Court’s decision in Doggett was yet to be given. 
      
       
     8 Those High Court decisions, together with some decisions of this Court, were reviewed by Sully J in his comprehensive judgment in Regina v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60. Relevantly for present purposes, his Honour expressed his conclusions following that review as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “It seems to me to be a reasonable inference from what their Honours have said that all the current Justices of the High Court, excepting the Chief Justice and McHugh J, take the basic position that in any criminal trial a feature of which is substantial delay in complaint of alleged sexual offences then charged against the particular accused, a  
         Longman 
          direction  
         must 
          be given. Not only  
         must 
          the direction be given; but it  
         must 
          be cast in a form that manifests, and is seen plainly to manifest, certain characteristics which one can draw, as follows, from the various statements of principle in  
         Longman 
          itself and in the subsequent decisions in  
         Crampton 
          and in  
         Doggett 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         (a) The direction must be cast in the form of a  
         warning 
         . Any form of expression which is thought to have the character of a  
         comment 
         , or even of a  
         caution 
          will not sufficiently comply with what is required by law. 
         
        
        
         
         It seems to me to follow that any trial Judge who is framing a  
         Longman 
          direction ought to ensure that the direction is framed, in terms, as a  
         warning 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         (b) That which is to be warned against is, to return to the majority judgment in  
         Longman 
           
         itself 
         : ‘ 
         that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of [the particular period relevant in the particular trial], it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, was satisfied of its truth and accuracy’. 
         
        
        
         
         The approach of the majority Justices in both  
         Crampton 
           
         and  
         Doggett 
          seems to me to entail that a trial Judge who is framing a  
         Longman 
          direction must ensure that the final form of the direction to the jury covers in terms the following propositions:  
         first 
         , that because of the passage of time the evidence of the complainant cannot be adequately tested;  
         secondly 
         , that it would be, therefore, dangerous to convict on that evidence alone;  
         thirdly 
         , that the jury is entitled, nevertheless, to act upon that evidence alone if satisfied of its truth and accuracy;  
         fourthly 
         , that the jury cannot be so satisfied without having first scrutinised the evidence with great care;  
         fifthly 
         , that the carrying out of that scrutiny must take into careful account any circumstances which are peculiar to the particular case and which have a logical bearing upon the truth and accuracy of the complainant’s evidence; and  
         sixthly 
         , that every stage of the carrying out of that scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence must take serious account of the warning as to the dangers of conviction. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) Not only must the substance of the warning be carefully and correctly focused, but the form of the warning, also, must be carefully and correctly framed. 
         
        
        
         
         The form of the warning must be such as bears unmistakably the imprint of the Court’s own authority. It must be made clear that the foundation of that authoritative warning of the Court itself is the accumulated experience of the Courts in dealing with cases characterised by substantial delay in the making of complaint about alleged sexual offences. It will be unwise, and more probably than not will be held upon appellate review to have been erroneous, to frame the warning in a way which suggests that what is being said conveys in essence nothing more than the common sense of the jurors would in any event have indicated. A ready example of that will be found in the trial directions in  
         Crampton. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) In framing the substance of a  
         Longman 
           
         direction, a Judge must keep in mind not only the guidance given by the joint judgment in  
         Longman 
          itself, but also the additional considerations to which reference was made in their respective judgments by Deane J and McHugh J.” 
         
        
       
     9 It is immediately apparent that what his Honour said in the present case falls short of the requirements expressed by Sully J in that passage. His Honour did refer to the fact that the passage of time makes investigation more difficult for the defence, and while that aspect of the warning might have been expressed with greater emphasis and particularity, in the circumstances of this case what his Honour said there would not of itself persuade me that his direction as a whole was inadequate. 
      
       
     10 What does concern me, however, is that at no stage did his Honour warn the jury of the danger of convicting arising from the delay and the consequent need for careful scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence. Nor did his Honour refer to the effect upon the reliability of the complainant’s evidence of the delay, having regard to his relative youth. 
      
       
     11 True it is that the delay in this case is not as great as that found in some of the decided cases, in particular, Longman. True it is also that, over the relevant period, this complainant was somewhat older than the complainants in Longman and some of the other decided cases. Nevertheless, it appears to me that a direction concerning the effect of delay upon youthful recollection was called for. 
      
       
     12 It is that aspect in particular with which Deane and McHugh JJ dealt with in Longman. It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to McHugh J’s judgment at page 108 of that report. For those reasons, I am satisfied, as I have said, that this ground of appeal is made out, and the matter has such significance as to require the convictions to be set aside. 
      
       
     13 Counsel for the appellant argued that the Court should enter verdicts of acquittal, rather than directing a new trial. In that regard, he referred to the fact that the trial the subject of this appeal was a second trial, there having been an earlier trial in which the jury acquitted on some counts, but was unable to agree on the others. He referred also to the fact that the appellant had been on bail from his arrest in March 1999 until his ultimately being found guilty in this trial in November 2000. Finally, he referred to the fact that the appellant has now served some fifteen months of the sentence imposed upon him by the trial judge in the present trial.  
      
       
     14 These are significant considerations, but they are not such as to persuade me that there ought not be a new trial. The appellant has not, in my view, served a sufficient portion of the effective sentence imposed upon him to justify the course of directing verdicts of acquittal, and the allegations here are serious. 
      
       
     15 Accordingly, the orders I propose are that the appeal be allowed, the convictions be quashed and a new trial be held. 
      
       
     16 HEYDON JA: I agree with Justice Hidden. 
      
       
     17 BLANCH J: I also agree. 
      
       
     18 HEYDON JA: The orders of the Court will be those which Justice Hidden has just proposed.

      REGINA v ROGER CHASE 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
       
     1 BLANCH J: This is a Crown appeal against sentence, which was imposed in the District Court in respect of a series of robbery offences. The sentences were imposed on 7 September, 2001. Effectively, the respondent was sentenced in respect of a number of the offences, being counts 1-3 and 5-8, to a fixed term of three years imprisonment to date from 25 January, 2001. 
      
       
        
       2 There was a further offence, count 4, which was robbery whilst armed, and on that charge the sentencing judge imposed a cumulative sentence of three years, which was to date from 25 January, 2004. In respect of that cumulative sentence, his Honour found that there were special circumstances, and specified a non-parole period of eighteen months from 25 January, 2004, so that the total effective sentence imposed in the District Court was one of six years, with a four and a half year non-parole period. 
        
        
       3 I would note at the outset that the special circumstances that his Honour found related to the dysfunctional background and drug addiction of the respondent, and he would have been entitled to have found special circumstances merely because the second sentence was expressed to be cumulative upon the first. Having found special circumstances on the basis that he did, however, the end result of the sentence that he imposed in totality was six years, with a four and a half year non-parole period, and the non-parole period looked at as a percentage of the total sentence is, in fact, the statutory proportion. 
        
        
       4 The offences largely relate to offences of robbery and aggravated robbery on railway stations in company with other people. In some of them there was a degree of violence used, but apart from the one matter of count 4, that I have mentioned, there was no suggestion of the respondent being armed. 
        
        
       5 In sentencing him, the judge also took into account on a Form 1, two charges of aggravated robbery, two charges of robbery in company, one charge of demand money with menaces, two charges of goods in custody, and one charge of common assault. Obviously it was a serious episode of criminality involving the terrorising of people on the public transport system and, of course, in that context it was a case where it was legitimate to impose a sentence which reflected significant elements of general deterrence. 
        
        
       6 There was a co-offender by the name of Williams, who was sentenced at the same time. Williams apparently committed a similar sequence of offences and was a co-offender of this respondent in respect of many of the offences. There was one offence, however, which Williams committed, and in respect of which this respondent was not involved. 
        
        
       7 That offence was on a video store at Leichhardt on 16 January and the facts found by the trial judge were that Williams went into the shop with two other males, a knife was produced, and the man in charge of the store was required to open the cash register and lie on the ground. The knife was held close to his face and whilst he was lying on the floor, he had several boxes of merchandise thrown at him, striking him in the back. He described the boxes as full boxes of glass orange juice containers. Obviously, the circumstances of that particular offence, involving the use of a knife and the use of a significant amount of gratuitous violence during the course of the offence, made that a serious offence indeed. 
        
        
       8 In imposing sentence on Williams, the sentencing judge took exactly the same course in the format of his sentencing as he did in respect of this respondent. However, he came to the conclusion, so far as Williams was concerned, that for the offence that I have just outlined, being the robbery, armed with a knife, that he should impose a six year cumulative sentence, with a three year fixed term. So that Williams ended up with a sentence of nine years, with a non-parole period of six and a half years. Again his Honour found special circumstances, again those special circumstances related to the dysfunctional background of the prisoner. 
        
        
       9 One of the matters raised by the Crown in this appeal is that the sentencing judge did not advert to the fact that this respondent was on parole. The judge did advert to the fact that the respondent had been released on bonds, and he was in breach of those bonds, one of them was a bond for robbery, given in the Children’s Court. 
        
        
       10 Insofar as Williams is concerned, he was on parole for robbery at the time the offences were committed. It might be said in the overall context of this case, that the offender Williams was somewhat older, had a somewhat longer record, was on parole at the time of these offences for robbery, and committed the one more serious offence. It might reasonably be expected, therefore, that Williams would get a sentence that was significantly longer than the sentence given to this respondent. 
        
        
       11 There has been no appeal by the Crown against the sentence which was imposed on Williams, and accordingly this Court is asked to review the sentence of this respondent on the basis that his overall criminality and other circumstances place him in a position where he is liable to a lower sentence than might be passed on Williams. 
        
        
       12 As I have said, the discrepancy in the non-parole period is only a period of two years. Moreover, as I have also said, the four and a half year non-parole period imposed in this case, although purportedly fixing a non-parole, relying on the fact that special circumstances existed, did not, in reality, reduce the statutory ratio of the overall sentence. 
        
        
       13 For my own part, I would see the only arguable proposition for the Crown being one of increasing the head sentence and not the non-parole period. I say that because this respondent was 19 years of age at the time these offences were committed. He was 20 at the time of sentence, and he is 21 years of age now. 
        
        
       14 Another fact to bear in mind is that he has now been serving the sentence since 7 September last year. 
        
        
       15 It is not only those bare facts that need to be considered so far as this respondent is concerned, there is also what the sentencing judge described as his dysfunctional background, and that comment related to the fact that the respondent was adopted out by his parents when he was two years of age; his adoptive parents divorced, there were then further relationships and separations, and the fact of the matter is that it is now very difficult to find someone in the community who is prepared to take some responsibility for this respondent – although on the material produced, it appears that he has now got some support in the community. 
        
        
        
       16 In looking at Crown appeals, the classic statement in relation to matters of this kind can be found in  
       Griffiths v The Queen 
        (1976-1977) 137 CLR 293. At page 310, Barwick CJ said: 
        
         
          
          “Inadequacy of sentence, an expression not found in the  
          Criminal Appeal Act 
           but which is the form in which the ground of the Attorney-General’s appeal is expressed, is not satisfied by a mere disagreement by the Court of Appeal with the sentence actually imposed. It means, in my opinion, such an inadequacy in the sentence as is indicative of error or departure from principle. No doubt, consistency in the sentences imposed by the judges of the District Court is a desirable feature of criminal administration. Gross departure from what might in experience be regarded as the norm may be held to be error in point of principle. Thus, in an appropriate case, the Court of Criminal Appeal may exercise its influence towards such consistency of sentence. But that consistency is not to be sought or secured, in my opinion, by the Court of Criminal Appeal substituting in any case which the Attorney-General cares to bring before it, its own view of the appropriate sentence irrespective of the presence or absence of error on the part of the trial judge.” 
          
         
        
        
       17 In my view, no such error has occurred in this case and also in my view it would be wrong to interfere with the sentence of this respondent, bearing in mind the sentence imposed on Williams, which has not been appealed by the Crown. 
        
       18 Accordingly, I propose that the appeal of the Crown be dismissed. 
        
        
       19 HEYDON JA:  
        I agree with Blanch J. 
        
        
       20 HIDDEN J 
       : I also agree.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales following the entry of pleas of guilty to four offences charged in the one indictment. The applicant also sought that the court take into account a further offence. 
      
       
     2 The applicant pleaded guilty to three offences of robbery armed with an offensive weapon, that is to say, a tomahawk. Those offences were committed on 22 July 2001, 18 July 2001 and 16 July 2001. For each of them the maximum penalty prescribed in law is 20 years imprisonment. The applicant also pleaded guilty to an offence also charged in the indictment of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely, assault. That is an offence under s.114(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which, dealt with on indictment, is seven years imprisonment. The offence he sought be taken into account was an offence of fail to pay a taxi fare. That offence was taken into account on the sentence imposed by the learned trial judge on count one in the indictment. For that offence the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three years to commence on 29 July 2001 expiring on 28 July 2004.  
      
       
     3 On count two the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for four years and six months commencing on 29 July 2004 and expiring on 28 January 2009. A non-parole period of two years commencing on 29 July 2004 and expiring on 28 July 2006 was imposed. 
      
       
     4 On count three the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for three years commencing on 29 July 2001. 
      
       
     5 On count four the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for one year commencing on 29 July 2001 and expiring on 28 July 2002. The applicant had been arrested on 29 July 2001 and has remained in custody since that date. He had a short record but a serious one for prior offences as a juvenile involving the commission of an aggravated indecent assault and two breaches of probation. Those matters had been dealt with by the Children’s Court initially placing him on probation and later on a control order and requiring the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice and appropriate counselling with a view to his rehabilitation.  
      
       
     6 The control order contained a term providing for an additional term of 12 months concluding on 12 April 2000. It can be seen, therefore, that he had a period of time in which he was not subject to supervision prior to the commission of these offences. The learned trial Judge referred to an aggravating feature of the offences, that they were committed in company. 
      
       
     7 The facts of the offences were summarised briefly in the Crown brief and set out in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. 
      
       
        
         
         ""Offence 1:- 
         
        
        
         
         At about 11.00 pm on Monday 16 July 2001, a telephone call was made by somebody in the company of the prisoner to the Pizza Hut Delivery Service. When the order was placed for four pizzas and two bottles of drink, a request was made that they be delivered to 6/3 Short Street, Carlton. At about 11.30 pm, a person from the Pizza Hut arrived at that address and parked his vehicle. As he unloaded the pizzas from his vehicle, the prisoner was carrying a 30 centimetre tomahawk which he placed at the base of the victim's neck. The prisoner said, 'No trouble, no-one gets hurt, where's your keys?'. The other person then took the pizzas from the pizza driver, and the prisoner then forced the pizza deliverer to walk down the street away from his vehicle. The prisoner was holding the tomahawk to the throat of the victim throughout this event. The other young person had removed the mobile phone from the car of the pizza deliverer. The prisoner walked the pizza driver to a nearby park, and he then returned to Short Street. 
         
        
        
         
         Offence 2:- 
         
        
        
         
         At 10.24 pm on Wednesday 18 June 2001, a phone call was made by somebody in the company of the prisoner to another pizza establishment requesting pizza and bread and coke. At about 11.10 pm on the same evening, the pizza driver from that establishment arrived at 3 Short Street, Carlton. He parked his vehicle and began to hand the pizzas and drinks out to another person in the company of the prisoner. The prisoner then moved behind the pizza driver and placed a tomahawk at the base of the pizza driver's neck. The prisoner then demanded that the pizza deliverer hand over his wallet and cash. That person then handed the prisoner the monies he had taken from deliveries throughout the night, being a total of $373.70. The prisoner then walked the pizza deliverer a short distance down the street before the pizza deliverer broke free and ran away. A mobile phone was then taken from the pizza deliverer's vehicle. 
         
        
        
         
         Offence 3:- 
         
        
        
         
         At about 7.20 pm on Sunday 22 July 2001, an order for pizzas was placed with a different store at Hurstville. At about 10.05 pm, a pizza deliverer from that establishment attended Short Street, Carlton to deliver the pizzas. He parked his vehicle outside unit block number three. The prisoner and another person approached this driver who handed them the pizzas, believing they had ordered them. The prisoner then produced a 30 centimetre tomahawk and placed it at the bottom of the pizza driver's neck. The prisoner then demanded the victim's money bag which contained the night's takings of about $200 in cash. The prisoner then removed the pizza driver's Panasonic mobile phone. The prisoner then made the pizza driver walk a short distance down the street, with the axe still at his neck. He then allowed the pizza driver to run from the area. 
         
        
        
         
         Offence 4:- 
         
        
        
         
         At about 12.05 am on Friday 26 July 2001, the prisoner and two male persons approached a taxi cab which was parked in Railway Street, Lidcombe. They asked the driver to take them to Hurstville. When he got to Hurstville, the prisoner told the driver to stop. The rear passengers in the cab who were with the prisoner got out. The driver of the cab asked the prisoner for the fare that was owed, and the prisoner said, 'I'll get my wallet'. The prisoner then reached under his trench coat with his right hand and removed a small wooden-handled axe from a coat. The cab driver, for his own safety, attempted to try and take the axe from the prisoner. While doing so, he tried to drive his cab away and, as he did so, he left the two other males standing at the kerb. As he drove away, the prisoner jumped out of the moving cab and ran away without paying for the fare."" 
         
        
       
     8 His Honour noted that the offences were objectively very serious. In each case the offender menaced others with a tomahawk. In each case the person so menaced was a person who by reason of their occupation was vulnerable to such attacks. His Honour concluded that personal and general deterrence needed to be marked in this case by an appropriate sentence. Notwithstanding that he concluded that the applicant then aged 19 years and three months had prospects of rehabilitation which were of some importance. His Honour looked at the evidence which suggested that the offences were out of the applicant’s character and occurred whilst the applicant was in Sydney and away from his mother’s care and supervision. He had a good work history and a good attitude to his work but his Honour had regard to the report of the Probation and Parole Service in which the applicant attributed his actions to being associated with undesirables in Sydney while leading a gang life existence. His Honour made substantial reference to a conclusion contained in the Probation and Parole Service Report:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Wu presented as defensive and self protective, somewhat immature yet manipulative. He displayed a well developed mechanism for minimising his role in the offences. He displayed no compunction for the offences in which he was involved. The writer of this report further formed the impression that further association with the criminal element in custody could work to his detriment, but it must be noted that this man’s anti social behaviour and seemingly psychopathic behaviour could place the community at risk of exposure to further criminal activity by this man if he is released to life in the community."" 
         
        
       
     9 His Honour noted this will be the first experience by the applicant of adult prison life other than that which he spent in custody on remand. He afforded to the applicant the benefit associated with having entered a plea of guilty at the first reasonable opportunity, and noted that he not having heard from the applicant as to any remorse, there was in addition nothing to record any remorse on his part in the Probation and Parole Service Report.  
      
       
     10 His Honour had regard to the principles in the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and the total criminality of the offences having regard to those offences as having been committed as part of a continuing course of criminal conduct over an 11 day period. He concluded that it was appropriate that the sentences should not be cumulative sentences as that would result in a prison term unduly harsh but it was necessary that the sentences recognised the spate of violent criminal behaviour putting a number of innocent people in terror. 
      
       
     11 His Honour concluded that it was necessary to impose in each case a sentence which each offence individually justified and then applying the principle of totality to exercise his discretion and make the sentences partly cumulative and partly concurrent. His Honour reflected in the non-parole period the seriousness with which the community views armed robberies but did find special circumstances such as to permit a variation in the statutory ratio in order to afford the applicant the benefit of an extended parole period. 
      
       
     12 It has been submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour fell into error in a number of ways, firstly, giving such weight to the observations of the Probation and Parole Service Officer as his Honour did and in particular as referred to in the quotation from the report to which I have made reference; secondly, that his Honour failed to give sufficient regard to contrition and remorse as evidenced by the plea of guilty and thirdly, failing to give sufficient regard to the prospects of rehabilitation. 
      
       
     13 In addition to those specific criticisms it is submitted that the sentences imposed upon the applicant were manifestly excessive although it is conceded they are within the range of the sentencing guidelines. It is also submitted they are at the very high end of the range taking into account the subjective features of the applicant and objective features of the offences. In this regard Mr. Galluzo of counsel who appeared on behalf of the applicant, and who has said in his written and oral submissions all that can be said, has submitted that having regard to the sentencing statistics with which he has provided us from the Judicial Commission in such circumstances as those of the applicant, the sentence exceeds such other sentences as are there notified. Those statistics indicate that for multiple crimes of armed robbery in respect of which persons had come forward for sentence after the judgment in Henry (supra), with prior but unrelated offences and of the age group, 21 to 30 years on a plea of guilty, the head sentence and non parole period in this case exceed what had been passed on other offenders. 
      
       
     14 During argument I expressed to Mr. Galluzo the view that if in the range of persons coming forward for sentence in such circumstances no one had managed to achieve a sentence in excess of the seven years head sentence and 48 months non-parole period noted in the statistics notwithstanding the number of armed robberies that might have been committed, there would appear to be some difficulty either about the sentencing parameters being appropriate or the adequacy of the statistics. There have been a number of judgments in this court concerning the inappropriateness of placing complete reliance on these statistics for the purpose of defining the appropriate range of sentence, particularly in the context where, as here, those statistics seem entirely out of line with the maximum sentence provided by the legislature for the individual crimes.  
      
       
     15 In my view, whilst this is a severe sentence it does not reach that degree of severity to which Mr. Galluzo referred when he submitted that the sentence was in excess of the appropriate and available range in the exercise of discretion by a trial judge. True it is a heavy sentence indeed and particularly for one so young, but when I have regard to the objective circumstances of each of the crimes, notwithstanding the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and notwithstanding his subjective circumstances, I am unable to see that the trial judge fell into error by passing a sentence so excessive as to show an error in law in the exercise of his discretion such that the court would be warranted in intervening. 
      
       
     16 The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides in s.6(3) that the court is only empowered to intervene in the event that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. That subsection has long been understood as requiring the finding of some such error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion as the High Court referred to in the oft quoted passage from House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. 
      
       
     17 I do not see that this sentence can be regarded as such as to support any such finding of error here; nor do I see that any of the individual criticisms made the sentencing process are made out. In my view, the application for leave to appeal should be granted in that the matter has been fully argued but the appeal against sentence dismissed. 
      
       
     18 CARRUTHERS, AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     19 GREG JAMES, J: The orders of the court will be as I have proposed.

     1 HEYDON, JA: I agree with Greg James, J. 
      
       
     2 GREG JAMES, J: The appellant appeals against his convictions following a trial in the District Court of New South Wales at Parramatta before his Honour Judge Neild and a jury on two counts: one of robbery, an offence under s.94 of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment; and the other, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence under s.59 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty prescribed is five years imprisonment. 
      
       
     3 Although, in his notice of appeal, the appellant gave notice of his desire to appeal against sentence also, and in the written submissions there was expressed an intent that further submissions would be provided in respect of sentence, on the hearing of the appeal, senior counsel for the appellant informed the court that on reflection there was no argument to be put challenging the sentences. The application for leave to appeal against the sentences should therefore be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Grounds of appeal 
        
       
     4 Three grounds of appeal were advanced. They were:- 
      
       
        
         
         1. The learned trial judge erred in failing to exclude the evidence of Mr. Brown purporting to identify the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The directions given to the jury by the learned trial judge on the evidence of identification were inadequate. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The verdict of guilty is unreasonable, having regard to the evidence in the case. 
         
        
       
     5 That last ground was particularised in the oral and written submissions as propounding that the identification was inadequate to support the conviction, having regard to what were asserted to be significant defects in the reliability of it, the delay in the undertaking of the relevant photographic examinations and an over-confident assertion by one witness only of an identification which was both unsupported by other evidence and not of such quality as to found a reliable conclusion of guilt. 
      
       
     6 By way of context, it was argued that a cross-examination of the appellant when he gave evidence at the trial concerning the circumstances of his refusal to participate in a line up and the way that matter and the appellant's case were left to the jury in the summing up by the learned trial judge were such as to have a prejudicial effect obscuring the unreliability and inadequacy of the identification in the context of the whole of the evidence against the appellant, which evidence, when objectively considered, was, it was submitted, insufficient to support the verdict. 
      
       
     7 In his oral submissions, senior counsel for the appellant referred to this ground as deriving from the other two grounds and it was submitted that what had been submitted with respect to the other two grounds bore upon ground three. It was put:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is simply a global submission that when looked at altogether the evidence was not sufficiently compelling."" 
         
        
       
     8 The Crown submitted that, having regard to what were submitted to be entirely proper and adequate directions and the evidence of Mr. Brown which it was submitted was properly admitted and supportive of what was submitted to be an entirely sufficient primary identification, that the evidence was adequate it was said that the question of ""there being an unreasonable verdict just does not arise"". 
      
       
     9 Since it will be necessary to refer to the extent of the evidence when considering those other grounds on which there was a challenge to the admissibility and adequacy of the identification evidence and to the appropriateness of the trial judge's directions, particularly considering what was submitted to be the weaknesses of that evidence, it will be convenient to return to this ground later. 
      
       
        
       The Evidence 
        
       
     10 The general nature of the evidence in the case sufficiently appears in a summary provided in the Crown submissions:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""On 20 April 2000 at about 2.30 pm, Mona Fernandez, who was seven months pregnant, and Murray Brown left their place of employment, Union Steel at Wetherill Park, to go to the ANZ bank at Smithfield. This day was the Thursday before Good Friday. Ms. Fernandez had about $2,080 cash in her purse to pay for blinds she had had installed. At the bank, Ms. Fernandez cashed a company cheque for $3,000 while Mr. Brown waited for her inside the bank. 
         
        
        
         
         While she was waiting in the queue, Ms. Fernandez noticed a man outside the bank, about six metres away from her, talking on a mobile phone. She had a side view of him and observed that he wore a sport cap, a white t-shirt and blue shorts. 
         
        
        
         
         After receiving the money, Ms. Fernandez put it into her purse and she and Mr. Brown drove back to Union Steel, about a five or 10 minute drive from the bank. Ms. Fernandez did not see the person on the mobile phone when she left the bank. At Union Steel, Mr. Brown parked in his allocated parking spot about six metres from the front door. Mr. Brown noticed a maroon four wheel drive doing a three point turn in the front driveway. 
         
        
        
         
         As they walked around the corner to the entrance doors of the office, Ms. Fernandez saw a man standing near the entrance in the corner where the door was recessed. She looked at his face and noticed his 'piercing eyes'. 
         
        
        
         
         As Ms. Fernandez opened the door and started to pass through it, she felt her bag being taken from her shoulder. She held onto the straps while the person pulled at the bag. The straps broke and Ms. Fernandez fell backwards onto a pot plant in the reception area and the person began to leave. As he left he punched Mr. Brown, who sustained redness to the left cheek and ear swelling. The man ran to a maroon four wheel drive. Mr. Brown chased the car and was able to note the first three letters of the registration, 'VTA'. He telephoned 000 and gave a description of the car and the man. He described the man to the operator as being in his early twenties, Mediterranean appearance, slight thin build, five foot seven inches, dark blue, black baseball cap, jeans, white t-shirt with a tear on the back. In evidence he described the man as having been around 25 years old, 170-175 centimetres tall with a thin build. He said the man had olive skin and looked to be of Mediterranean appearance. He had short, dark coloured hair, was clean shaven and wore blue jeans, a white t-shirt and a dark coloured baseball cap. 
         
        
        
         
         While the robbery was occurring, Ms. Fernandez noticed the man was wearing a blue baseball hat, a white t-shirt and blue shorts. She realised that it must have been the same person that she had seen standing outside the bank. She described the man who grabbed her bag as being 'about 175 centimetres tall, thin build, fair skin, Caucasian, young, early 20's'. She thought he had brown hair but was not sure because of the cap he was wearing. His hair was short, because she could not see any hair hanging outside the cap. He wore sandshoes and white socks. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr. Brown did not notice where the man came from. He saw the man shove Ms. Fernandez and grab her bag. As he turned around he hit Mr. Brown, who staggered back a couple of steps and down the single step in front of the door. The man lost his footing on the single step and fell over. Mr. Brown tried to grab the man by his shirt but he twisted away, tearing the shirt a little. 
         
        
        
         
         Two uniformed constables attended the scene. Detective Smith received a call on his radio and attended. Ms. Fernandez had been examined by ambulance personnel and had returned home. Detective Smith arranged for the attendance of fingerprint police. Fingerprints were lifted from the glass door on 20 April 2000 and the fingerprints of the appellant did not match those taken from the door. There was no fingerprint expert report because the appellant was not implicated by fingerprint evidence. No fingerprints were lifted from the maroon four wheel drive which was recovered. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr. Brown made a statement to police on 20 April 2000. In that statement he said that he saw the man standing at the entry door holding the door open with his hand on the glass panel. On 2 June 2000, he went to Green Valley Police Station where he was shown 10 photographs. He numbered and initialled the back of each photograph. He selected two photographs, numbered six and five, and told police that it was possible that one of those two people was the robber. Number six was a photograph of the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         On the Saturday following the robbery Ms. Fernandez received a telephone call that her bag had been found. When she retrieved it from Casula the money and her sunglasses were missing. 
         
        
        
         
         On 24 April 2000, Ms. Fernandez made a statement to police including her description of the man who took her bag. On 10 July 2000, Inspector O'Connor went to her home and showed her 10 photographs (Exhibit A). She numbered and initialled the back of each photograph except for the one she identified as the person who robbed her, which she signed. That photograph, numbered three, was of the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         Detective Smith described the appellant's appearance when he spoke to him on 26 July 2000. He said the appellant had fairly short cropped hair, was of a thin to medium build which was similar to his build at trial, and at the time of his arrest was between 170 and 175 centimetres. He did not record Ms. Fernandez's statements about the robber's eyes because he believed they were a perception rather than a description. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     11 In the written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant appears the following concerning the evidence of Ms. Fernandez, Mr. Brown, the fingerprint evidence and the evidence of the appellant:- 
      
       
        
         
         "" 
         Evidence of Ms. Fernandez  
         
        
        
         
         3. Ms. Fernandez was seven months pregnant at the time of the offence. She stated that she observed a person at the front door and saw him from 30-40 centimetres away. She gave a description of this person in evidence as wearing a blue baseball cap, white t-shirt and blue shorts, he was 175 centimetres tall, thin build, fair skin, Caucasian, young early twenties and seemed like he had very short brown hair but had a cap on. She stated that afterwards she realised it must have been the same man she had seen outside the bank. She also gave evidence that he had 'piercing eyes'. This description did not appear in her statement to the police though both she and the police officer who took her statement (Detective Smith) gave evidence that she had talked about the eyes of the suspect when interviewed by police. She stated that she felt her bag go as she stepped through the door past the man and that she held onto the strap and had a struggle with him which lasted for approximately seven seconds. She was face to face with him during this time and said that she was scared. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The police took a statement from her following her first description of the robber on 24 April 2000 and showed her photographs on 10 July 2000. She picked out a photograph of the appellant stating that 'I'm sure that's him his eyes are so piercing' (Exhibit 'D). She gave evidence that she was absolutely sure and knew straight away that it was the robber and the eyes stood out. She was 110% sure. … 
         
        
        
         
         Evidence of Mr. Brown 
         
        
        
         
         5. Mr. Brown was two to three feet behind Ms. Fernandez when she was robbed. He stated that she (sic) he saw her pushed from behind and her bag taken immediately. He first saw the man when he pushed her. The man then turned to leave and punched Mr. Brown to the face causing redness and swelling. Mr. Brown grabbed hold of him and the man fell to the ground. He twisted out of Mr. Brown's reach and ran to a waiting car which sped off. Mr. Brown gave a description to 000 over the phone straight after the robbery. He described the robber as early twenties, Mediterranean appearance, slight thin build, five foot seven inches, wearing a dark blue/black baseball cap, t-shirt with tear in the back, and jeans. He made a statement to the same effect that afternoon at around 5.30 (some two and a half hours after the assault). On 2 June 2000, he was asked to look through photographs by the police. He told them that he did not recognise anyone in the photographs, but if he had to 'put his hand on it' he would say 'he's possible' and 'he's possible', picking two photographs. He explained in evidence that he picked these two as possible as they were the only two of Mediterranean appearance in the bundle of photographs. He then told the police that 'it looks similar to one of those people' and that he couldn't positively identify anyone from the photographs. He also commended that 'the person was wearing a hat and sunglasses at the time'. … 
         
        
        
         
         Fingerprint evidence 
         
        
        
         
         6. The police were directed by Mr. Brown to a position on the door where the assailant had held the door open. Fingerprints were found and developed, but those fingerprints did not match the fingerprints of the appellant. Neither did fingerprints found on a toolbox in the back of the getaway care. 
         
        
        
         
         Evidence of the appellant 
         
        
        
         
         7. The appellant gave evidence in which he denied being the assailant. The trial was held in March 2002. The appellant did not know where he was one year earlier on 20 April 2000. He had not turned his mind to this on 25 May 2000 when he was requested to attend a line-up, as he did not know he was a suspect and thought the police might have wanted him to help in a line up. He did not think about it because as far as he was concerned it was not relevant to him, and his solicitor had advised him not to participate in the line up. There was cross-examination directed to establishing that the appellant's opinion that the police might have wanted him to 'help' in a line-up was not credible and that the robbery took place in a suburb close to his mother's place of residence."" 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     12 In addition to the foregoing, there should be specific reference to the statement of Mr. Brown of 2 June 2000 which was apparently in the form of a recorded interview between Mr. Brown and police on that date which was before the jury as Exhibit C. Questions and answers 23-30 are as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q.23. Do you recognise any of the people in those photographs? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Umm … No. If umm … I had to point my hand on it, I'd put it out of, I'd say, he's possible or he's possible, not the rest of the guys. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.24. Okay. Just turn those photographs over. You've indicated to me … umm … photographs number six and photographs number five … 
         
        
        
         
         A. That's correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.25 … umm … are you telling me that these are the people responsible for the robbery? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yep, umm … only one of 'em. The other person that was driving the vehicle I didn't see. I wouldn't know if it was male or female. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.26. Okay. Are you saying that it is one of these people, or that it looks similar? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It looks similar to one of these people. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.27. Okay. 
         
        
        
         
         A. I'm not positively identifying them, I can't … 
         
        
        
         
         Q.28. Okay 
         
        
        
         
         A. … but the person was wearing a hat and sunglasses at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.29. In relation to the other photographs, do any of those other people look familiar? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mmm, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.30. Perhaps I'll, just so that I can clarify, to be certain. Is it the case that none of the people depicted in these photographs look like the person who committed this offence? Or rather, I'll rephrase that, not look like … none of these people are the people who actually committed the offence? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I couldn't positively say that any of these people are the people who committed the offence.""  
         
        
        
       Ground One 
        
       
     13 After the arraignment of the accused at the commencement of the trial, objection was taken to the admissibility of the evidence of Mr. Brown of his identification of the two photographs. The learned trial judge conducted a voir dire in which were admitted by consent the statements of Mrs. Fernandez, the 10 colour photographs numbered and initialled by her, the statements of Mr. Brown and the 10 coloured photographs signed and dated by him. It was conceded on the voir dire that photograph number three of those identified by Ms. Fernandez was a photograph of the accused and that Mr. Brown had picked two photographs, five and six, of which photograph six was a photograph of the accused. Evidence of the process of photograph identification in which Mr. Brown engaged is set out in that portion of Exhibit C I have already quoted. 
      
       
     14 There was discussion before the trial judge concerning the description of the accused and the trial judge was informed that the descriptions given generally fitted the accused except that it was challenged by his counsel at trial that he was ""Mediterranean looking"". There was short debate before his Honour and reference was made to the decision of the High Court in Regina v. Pitkin (1995) 69 ALJR 612. His Honour ruled the evidence admissible, publishing a short judgment. His Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The accused's counsel objects to the Crown Prosecutor adducing evidence of a witness, a Mr. Murray Brown, who gave a description of the robber to police in his statement 20 April 2000, Exhibit B1, and who, later, on 2 June 2000, selected – although that may not be the correct word, two photographs as being photographs of a person similar in appearance to the robber. One of the two photographs is a photograph of the accused. The victim of the robbery, Miss Fernandez, had viewed photographs on 10 July 2000, and she selected a photograph, which is a photograph of the accused, as being the photograph of the robber. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused's counsel submits that the evidence of Mr. Fernandez is not identification evidence, that if it is identification evidence it is inadmissible because it does not positively identify the accused as the robber and if it is identification evidence, and if it is admissible, it should be excluded in the exercise of a discretion under s.135 or s.136 of the Evidence Act or excluded under s.137, but not in the exercise of any discretion. It is unfortunate, perhaps, that the evidence of Mr. Brown is not as positive as the evidence of Miss Fernandez that the accused – at least a photograph of him, is a photograph of the robber, but I do not see that that means that the evidence is inadmissible. It may well be that the evidence has less value than the evidence of Ms. Fernandez, but the evidence does tend to support the evidence of Ms. Fernandez. In my view, it is identification evidence, and in my view, it is probative. 
         
        
        
         
         As to whether or not it its (sic) probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, I cannot see any basis upon which it could be so considered. All evidence adduced by a Crown Prosecutor is prejudicial to an accused. The evidence is designed to secure a conviction by showing that the accused committed the particular offence. I cannot see any unfair prejudice to the accused in admitting evidence which tends to confirm his being the robber. I cannot see any basis to exercise any discretion under either s.135 of s.136 of the Evidence Act. The evidence is admissible, it is relevant, it is probative and there is not unfair prejudice to the accused by admitting it."" 
         
        
       
     15 Following the evidence at the trial of both Ms. Fernandez and Mr. Brown, a further application was made. The following exchange occurred:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""EVERS: My secondary application is to, having heard the evidence of Mr. Brown yesterday, where he had told the police that the person was of Mediterranean appearance and that he picked the two only people from the list that were of Mediterranean appearance, that is not an adequate and a proper photo file presented to the witness and as such that evidence should be excluded. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: The Crown says it shouldn't be. When one looks at the photographs, bearing in mind the descriptions they had, the evidence of, simply says – in fact his evidence is no stronger than saying 'it was one of those two people who look similar', so the Crown says it shouldn't be -  
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes, I agree with the Crown Prosecutor. The evidence won't be excluded merely because Mr. Brown considers that only two photographs, the two he selected, numbered five and six are photographs of people of a Mediterranean appearance. I must say, having looked at the photographs I don't think they're of Mediterranean appearance, and I think there are others more of Mediterranean appearance in the 10 photographs than those picked by Mr. Brown. I think all that means is that different people have different concepts of what is a Mediterranean appearance."" 
         
        
       
     16 After the evidence of Detective Smith, a further application was made on the basis, we were told, that his evidence revealed that the photographs for the identification process had been selected with the primary aim that they should be of persons resembling the suspect rather than of persons whose appearance corresponded with that of the description given. He had given evidence that he had sought to compile photographs similar to the photograph of the accused since it was felt that the description given was close to the appearance of the accused. Consistently, he asserted that in selecting the photographs, wider considerations were applied than merely seeking photographs similar to the photograph of the accused or according with the description. 
      
       
     17 Reference was also made to other matters of which the officer had given evidence. He had also been extensively cross-examined about the descriptions of the offender and his features, given to him by Mr. Brown and Ms. Fernandez and his observations of the appearance of the accused. He gave evidence that Mr. Brown had given ""an almost contemporaneous description"" of the offender ""that he was of Mediterranean appearance"" and that later in a statement to police Mr. Brown had said, ""he had olive skin and I would say he looked to be of Mediterranean appearance"" but that he had not clarified with Mr. Brown what that meant.  
      
       
     18 This application, too, was refused. 
      
       
     19 Before us it was submitted in writing that ""the evidence did not confirm the appellant as being the robber"" and that at most it showed the appellant and the robber shared with another person a particular physical characteristic. Although the evidence was within that encompassed by the description ""identification evidence"" in the dictionary to the Evidence Act, it was merely evidence of limited resemblance. It was submitted the evidence was irrelevant and highly prejudicial. Reliance was placed on Regina v. Pitkin (1995) 69 ALJR 612 and Regina v. Blick (2000) 111 A. Crim. R. 326. At trial, reference had been made to Regina v. Cook (CCA, unreported 24 August 1998). 
      
       
     20 In oral argument, the point was put somewhat differently. It was conceded that the evidence was relevant, but it was contended that since Mr. Brown had referred to two photographs as being similar to the offender, one of which was of the accused and the other of which was of a different person, the evidence was of little probative value and confusing without elucidation as to which photograph was being referred to and for what purpose. It was put that although the selection of the photograph of the accused as one of the two photographs selected might have supported the other evidence in the Crown case, the simultaneous selection of the other photograph not only deprived that act of much of its probative significance, but also contradicted it as a valid identification or at least confused the total picture so that the admission of the evidence focussing upon the selection of the accused's photograph was to the appellant's prejudice. That prejudice, it was submitted, was compounded by a lack of clarity in the words used by the witness in the process of selecting the photographs and by the trial judge's directions leaving the evidence to the jury as capable of supporting the accuracy of the identification of Ms. Fernandez without referring to these asserted problems. In this regard, I note and it was conceded, that there was no ground of objection, and no application at trial for any re-direction of a kind which might suggest that those involved in the conduct of the trial perceived any such significance in the evidence as is now suggested and it is clear from the extracted passage I have already set out that the legal representative of the appellant at the trial, at least at that point, did not assert a problem with Mr. Brown's identification but with the folder presented to him. 
      
       
     21 Applying s.55 of the Evidence Act 1995, the evidence of Mr. Brown's selection of the photograph was plainly relevant for its possible significance as narrowing the field of potential candidates for identification. It was evidence of particular features and of similarity. The argument that it supported exculpation if available was not raised at trial. It might have been made to the jury. Had it been, no doubt appropriate directions could have been given. In my view the evidence could have been regarded properly by the jury as supportive of the primary evidence of identification from Ms. Fernandez but not as primary evidence of identification itself. That is how the Crown sought to rely on it and how his Honour told the jury it could be used. It was not relied on as identification evidence hence the principle in Pitkin (supra) did not apply. In Pitkin (supra) and Blick (supra), the challenged evidence was the primary evidence of identification and in neither case was there an issue of relevance to this problem. 
      
       
     22 In Pitkin (supra), no question arose of excluding the evidence. The decision was concerned with its sufficiency, uncorroborated, to support the verdict. In Blick it was held that the evidence should have been excluded as of low probative value and high prejudicial effect. The relevant photograph identified was of the accused but it was the only photograph submitted to the witness of a person wearing, as the offender had, a goatee beard. That is not this case. Nor is the decision in Regina v. Fisher [2001] NSWCCA 380 of help, where only one person in a line up resembled the accused. The decision in Cook (supra) does not assist the submission. I see no such prejudice here as warranted exclusion under s.135 or s.137. The evidence is relevant and as it was used at trial and as the jury were told it could be used, neither confusing nor likely to cause prejudice in the sense that the jury would have given it weight to which it was not entitled or wrongly used it. In my view this ground should be rejected. This conclusion is supported by the views of the High Court on the admission of identification and similarity evidence in Festa v. The Queen (2001) 76 ALJR 291 cited to us at the close of argument and to which I will turn on the aspect of appropriate directions later in this judgment. 
      
       
     23 I turn now to ground two. As is not surprising, given the issues at trial and summations of the evidence to which I have referred, the bulk of the trial judge's summing up was devoted to directions on the issue of identification and an examination of the evidence which bore upon that issue. 
      
       
     24 The trial judge gave exemplary directions to the jury on their role and function and, in particular, generally how they might assess the evidence. After referring to the evidence of Senior Constable Smith concerning the description given to him by Ms. Fernandez on 24 April in which she referred to a feature of the assailant's eyes, his Honour pointed out to the jury that it was Senior Constable Smith's evidence that he had not recorded anything about what she had said concerning the assailant's eyes, as in his view she was referring to her perception in a way that she could not otherwise describe. His Honour referred to the evidence of Senior Constable Smith as to the collection of the photographs and Ms. Fernandez' observation when shown the photographs, ""I'm sure that's him. The eyes are so piercing."" 
      
       
     25 He directed the jury impeccably concerning the accused's refusing to participate in a line up. His Honour referred to the accused's evidence and again impeccably directed the jury that by the accused exercising the option to give evidence he did not take upon himself any burden, onus or obligation and reiterated the direction he had given at the start of the trial that the onus lay on the Crown from first to last to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence at the trial of his guilt. 
      
       
     26 It was in that context that he directed the jury ""members of the jury, this trial turns upon a conflict between the evidence of Ms. Fernandez and Mr. Brown, on the one hand, and the accused, on the other hand"". 
      
       
     27 It was in that context that his Honour also referred to the members of the jury being concerned to enquire who is to be believed and as to the prospect of their preferring the evidence of the Crown witnesses, directing them that in that event they must ask themselves the question as to whether the evidence that they accepted satisfied them beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, since it was not open to them to find the accused to be guilty unless the evidence which they accepted satisfied them beyond reasonable doubt of that guilt. 
      
       
     28 Having directed the jury as to the substance of the evidence in the trial, his Honour then turned to the differences in the accounts given by Ms. Fernandez and Mr. Brown:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""You have got a description from two difference people of that person. There are some differences. The most glaring difference is Mrs. Fernandez saying that the assailant was wearing shorts and Mr. Brown saying the assailant was wearing jeans. Now that is a difference. One is wrong because they are both describing one person. They are not describing two different people, both are describing the one person that was involved in the one incident in which Mrs. Fernandez was robbed and Mr. Brown was assaulted. Another thing that is definite is that one person got into the maroon coloured four-wheel drive. He was associated with that maroon coloured four-wheel drive, of that there is not any doubt. How did he get between Mrs. Fernandez and Mr. Brown at the front door unless, when Mr. Brown was parking his car, the maroon coloured four-wheel drive had arrived and the man had gone up and stood near the door. There could not have been any other way, you might think, for the man who was the assailant to have got to where Mrs. Fernandez and Mr. Brown were going from the bank other than that he and the driver of the car followed them and that he got out of the maroon four-wheel drive and went up and waited at the door when they went round to park their car because when he ran away with the bag in his hand, he got into that four-wheel drive. 
         
        
        
         
         Now, members of the jury, when you go to the jury room, do not lose sight of the fact that there is one incident, one person, one maroon four-wheel drive. Mr. Brown told you that he saw the four-wheel drive drive into the driveway, do a three-point turn and stop. Mrs. Fernandez did not see it. Does that mean it did not happen? Or does is simply mean that she did not see it? Why did not see it? (sic) Well, she might not have been looking in that direction. She might not have heard the sound of the car's engine. She might simply have failed to register its presence. Does that mean it was not there? Of course not. It was there because Mr. Brown told you about it being there. There was a man who got between Mrs. Fernandez and Mr. Brown. How did he get there? Mr. Brown said he did not run past him. He said that he did not come out of the door as Mrs. Fernandez was going in. Then, where was he? He must have been in the vicinity. Mrs. Fernandez told you that she noticed him. She looked into his face. He was beside her in the corner near the doorway. The fact that Mr. Brown did not see him standing there does not mean that he was not there. Mrs. Fernandez saw him standing there. Mr. Brown told you that he, the assailant, came between Mrs. Fernandez and him. Where did he come from if he did not come from where Mrs. Fernandez had seen him? Mr. Brown told you that he did not run past him. Mr. Brown told you he did not come out of the door as Mrs. Fernandez was opening it to go through it. 
         
        
        
         
         There are differences in the evidence of Mr. Brown and Mrs. Fernandez about what happened. Mrs. Fernandez, and I have mentioned this already, said she saw the man standing at the entrance door near the corner. Mr. Brown did not see him standing there. Mr. Brown did not see him until he came between Mrs. Fernandez and him. Mrs. Fernandez said that she had her bag pulled from behind and she was pulled backward. Mr. Brown told you that the man who came between him and Mrs. Fernandez gave 'Mona a good shove' and Mona went through the doorway stumbling forward. Now they are different, there cannot be any doubt that they are different but both of them are describing one thing. They have different descriptions but they are both describing the one thing. They are both describing the man doing something to Mrs. Fernandez and her bag. Mrs. Fernandez says that she was pulled backward and she fell backwards onto the floor with her bottom on the floor and her back against the flower pot. Mr. Brown said that 'Mona went flying' downwards onto the flower pot and he describing how she went over it on her right hand side. Mrs. Fernandez said that the door was, as it were, open and held open by the door mechanism. Mr. Brown said the man held open the door. Mrs. Fernandez says there was a scuffle between Mr. Brown and the man and then the man ran along the driveway and she described to you how she believed that Mr. Brown was trying to get her handbag back from the man. Mr. Brown said he was punched in the face by the man and he stumbled backwards a couple of steps and down one step and you will remember I asked how many steps were there and he said, 'One step'. He said that the man stumbled as he went down the step and fell to the ground. He said he grabbed the man's shirt and the man pulled away and ran towards the maroon four-wheel drive. He gave chase to the man and, when he realised it was pointless or hopeless, he used his mobile telephone to ring triple 0. Mrs. Fernandez did not see the man get into the maroon four-wheel drive but saw a maroon four-wheel drive being driven away. 
         
        
        
         
         Members of the jury, both of them are describing one thing. Both of them have different descriptions of that one thing. Does it mean that one is wrong? Does it mean that both are wrong? Or does it mean, members of the jury, that each of them saw in that one thing, in the 15 seconds or whatever it was for the thing to occur, different things in it? Members of the jury, the human memory is not like a computer or a tape recorder or a camera. The human memory is fallible. The human memory does not record everything perfectly in sequence for ready retrieval. A computer records everything that is put into it for ready, perfect retrieval. A tape recorder records on the magnetic tape everything spoken into the microphone for ready and perfect retrieval. A camera records in the picture everything within the focal length when the picture is taken. The human memory is not like any one of those things, it does not record perfectly or in order and it does not record necessarily everything that happens. Some things that are important or joyous or painful or momentous are recorded. The things that are everyday, mundane or trivial are not recorded. You may not be able to remember where you were on the Thursday before last Easter, but if last Easter Friday you were leaving Australia to go to America or England or getting ready for your wedding or the birth of your first child, then you would remember the Thursday before it. But if all you were doing was going to work or getting in the crowd of people that left Sydney to go on holidays, you might not remember it. That is because, members of the jury, you might remember the momentous, the joyous, the painful, something extraordinary but not the everyday, mundane or trivial. You might think Mrs. Fernandez and Mr. Brown were not concerned with something everyday, mundane or trivial, they were concerned with something that happened suddenly and unexpectedly, that happened in a relatively short time, that involved both of them, both of them being, as it were, assaulted in the sense that Mrs. Fernandez went over onto the ground when the straps on her handbag gave way and Mr. Brown was punched."" 
         
        
       
     29 His Honour then gave to the jury directions as to how the identification question should be considered by them. In particular, he focused his directions on whether the evidence identifying the accused as the assailant might satisfy them of his guilt. He directed the jury that the evidence must be approached by them with special care and caution before it could be accepted as being reliable and that care and caution was necessary even though the jury might be satisfied that the witnesses who had given evidence of identification were entirely honest in saying what they did. 
      
       
     30 Those directions were reiterated and the jury were further directed that it was only in the event that the evidence had been accepted after having been considered with great care and caution, that the jurors would be entitled to act on it. 
      
       
     31 The trial judge drew to the jury's attention a number of matters which, in his view, meant that ""identification evidence may, and I emphasis the word may, be unreliable"". 
      
       
     32 In a series of numbered points, he drew the jury's attention to particular factors, which might have been considered as affecting reliability and discussed each of those factors. They were:- 
      
       
        
         
         (1) Whether the witness giving the identification evidence had prior knowledge of the person to be identified. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) In that case, how well did the witness know the person. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) The length of time during which the witness had under observation the person. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) Over what distance that observation was conducted. 
         
        
        
         
         (5) The available lighting at the time of the observations. 
         
        
        
         
         (6) The presence or absence of particular features which might have impressed the observer. 
         
        
        
         
         (7) The state of mind of the witnesses at the time such as might have interfered with or assisted identification. 
         
        
        
         
         (8) The delay between observation and the witness giving to the authorities a description. 
         
        
       
     33 His Honour then turned to the description that had been given by Mr. Brown. In that regard, he referred to the accused's age of 26 years and six months as at 20 April 2000, when referring to that element of the description given by Mr. Brown that the accused was ""around 25"". His Honour referred to the appearance of the accused in court and directed the jury that it was open for them to assess for themselves whether he appeared to be his chronological age. He referred to the description given by Ms. Fernandez and in discussing that description, referred to the evidence of Senior Constable Smith of the height, build and appearance, particularly the hairstyle, of the accused at the time of arrest. I do not consider, having regard to the fact of the accused's presence in court and that there was evidence of his appearance on arrest, that his Honour acted other than entirely appropriately. 
      
       
     34 Having referred to the fact that the descriptions by Mr. Brown and Ms. Fernandez were given on 20 April 2000 and 24 April 2000 respectively, one on the day of the incident, the other within four days after the incident, his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""You might ask yourselves, members of the jury, how well or how badly does each witness' description compare with the person charged. Members of the jury, as I have said, you have seen the accused in court and in the witness box specifically. You know his date of birth, therefore you know his age at 20 April and now. You know his height, you can assess for yourselves his build, you can see his hair, you know that it was shorter on 26 July 2000 because he was photographed on that day and you can see his photograph. 
         
        
        
         
         So members of the jury, they are some of the things that you might like to take into account. 
         
        
       
     35 His Honour then gave the jury another direction as to the care and caution with which they should approach the ascertainment of the reliability of the identification evidence. 
      
       
     36 During that process of directing the jury as I have set out, in discussion of that feature of the person whose description had been given by Ms. Fernandez and Mr. Brown to Senior Constable Smith, his Honour referred to Ms. Fernandez' comment that the assailant was Caucasian and Mr. Brown's comment that the accused had a Mediterranean appearance. He said as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""… let me comment upon Caucasian and Mediterranean, and I have done this because I was not sure what either may mean and, of course, it does not matter what I think either may mean, but just to tell you, Caucasian relates to the area of the Caucuses (sic) and the Caucuses (sic) are a region between the Black and Caspian Seas that includes Russian, Georgia, Aserbaydzhan (sic) and Armenia. Caucasian in anthropological terms relates to a major human racial division traditionally distinguished by physical characteristics such as very light to brown skin pigmentation and straight to wavy or curly hair and including people indigenous to Europe, North Africa, Western Asia and India. Mediterranean refers to the Sea of 3,700 kilometres between the bottom part of Europe and the upper part of Africa and it relates to or characteristic of or located near the Mediterranean Sea and anthropologically it relates to a sub-group of the Caucasian race characterised by medium or short stature, slender build, dark complexion and relatively a long head. So, members of the jury, that is what Caucasian and Mediterranean mean. Neither is used now scientifically because they are so non specific. But it does not matter what the dictionary says they mean or what I think they mean or what you think they mean, Mr. Brown thought the accused has a Mediterranean appearance. Mrs. Fernandez thought that the accused does not have a Mediterranean appearance."" 
         
        
       
     37 This discussion by his Honour was not supported by any particular evidence in the case concerning the meaning of the two terms. What was in question was what the relevant witness meant by referring to ""Caucasian"" or ""Mediterranean"". His Honour adequately directed the jury as to that in the closing words of that passage. Although it was submitted his Honour should not have embarked on this discussion, I do not see it did any harm. 
      
       
     38 His Honour also referred to other differences noted between the accounts given by Mr. Brown and Ms. Fernandez. He referred to both of them having given evidence the assailant was wearing a baseball cap with a peak where it should be in the front of the head, rather than at the back of the head and that Ms. Fernandez described the assailant's skin as fair. She would not describe the accused as having olive skin. She described him as wearing blue shorts, white sandshoes and white socks. Mr. Brown did not mention socks and sandshoes. 
      
       
     39 His Honour then directed the jury that it was open to them to accept the evidence of Ms. Fernandez' identification of the photograph of the assailant and to find the accused not guilty, notwithstanding whatever they might think of Mr. Brown's evidence. As to that evidence he said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Mr. Brown has been unable to positively identify anyone as being the assailant, there is no doubt about that. You have got the transcript of what occurred when he was shown the photographs, and you should read it. His evidence can only be used in support of the evidence of Ms. Fernandez. His evidence alone would be insufficient for you to be satisfied that the accused was the assailant, and that is because his evidence is not a positive identification of the accused as being the assailant."" 
         
        
       
     40 The jury having left the courtroom, his Honour invited counsel to draw his attention to any matters of correction. 
      
       
     41 The appellant's legal representative referred to a factual matter concerning the actions of the assailant when he left the car and to another factual matter concerning the securing of the door on which fingerprints may have been left. She then sought a direction said to derive from the decision of this court in The Queen v. Barbaro (1993) 32 NSWLR 619 as to the particular dangers of photographic evidence. In the context of there having been no challenge to the evidence of Ms. Fernandez by cross-examination at the trial, his Honour declined to give that direction. 
      
       
     42 A direction was sought that the jury not assume the accused has a record because of the potential rogues gallery effect (see also Regina v. Alexander (1981) 145 CLR 395). The trial judge agreed to give it, and did give it. A further direction was sought in asserted reliance on s.116 of the Evidence Act. It was put that the trial judge was required to identify specific weaknesses in the evidence given, and that the jury's attention should be drawn to the absence of a contemporaneous account by Ms. Fernandez on 20 April, and that the trial judge had failed to draw the jury's attention to the absence of the reference to the piercing eyes in Ms. Fernandez' statement of 24 April: the trial judge agreed to do that, and did that, but the submission apparently was that these matters should have been characterised as ""weaknesses"". It was further asserted that his Honour had failed adequately to portray to the jury as weaknesses the differing accounts given by the witnesses as to the assailant wearing shorts or jeans, the fact that one witness said the assailant was fair and one said he was olive, and the fact that the police officer selected photographs similar to the accused rather than selecting those similar to the description given of the assailant and did not select photographs of people with piercing eyes. The argument put to his Honour proceeded on the basis that it was incumbent on his Honour to describe these matters to the jury as weaknesses in the identification. In sum, what was put was that in order for his Honour to comply with s.116 of the Evidence Act, it was incumbent on him to direct the jury concerning the absence from the evidence of matters said to be important or possible inconsistencies between witnesses on such matters and to describe those matters as ""weaknesses in identification"". Section 116 contains no such express requirement. Section 116 reads as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. If identification evidence has been admitted, the judge is to inform the jury:- 
         
        
        
         
          (a) that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence; and 
         
        
        
         
          (b) of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case. 
         
        
        
         
         2. It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in so informing the jury."" 
         
        
       
     43 However, in Domican v. The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555, the High Court in reference to the warning required under the common law held at 561-562:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The terms of the warning need not follow any particular formula. But it must be cogent and effective. It must be appropriate to the circumstances of the case. Consequently, the jury must be instructed 'as to the factors which may affect the consideration of [the identification] evidence in the circumstances of the particular case'. A warning in general terms is insufficient. The attention of the jury 'should be drawn to any weaknesses in the identification evidence'. Reference to counsel's arguments is insufficient. The jury must have the benefit of a direction which has the authority of the judge's office behind it. It follows that the trial judge should isolate and identify for the benefit of the jury any matter of significance which may reasonably be regarded as undermining the reliability of the identification evidence."" 
         
        
       
     44 Assuming, but not deciding, that the requirements of s.116 correspond entirely with those of Domican (supra), that decision does not require the judge to lend the judicial office to a characterisation of matters of evidence as showing weaknesses in fact. For a judge to do would be to intrude into the realm of the jury. It requires the jury to be instructed on matters of significance which the jury might consider might undermine reliability as the closing sentence of the passage cited makes clear. (See also Festa (supra), Gleeson, CJ. at 26, McHugh, J. at 80, Kirby, J. at 173 and 176 and Hayne, J. at 217-219.) 
      
       
     45 His Honour had the jury brought back into court and then gave the directions appearing below:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Members of the jury, I am to continue where I was. There are a few more things I wish to say to you about identification evidence and to remind you to assess the evidence of identification with great care and caution. You know that there is not any recording by anyone of Mrs. Fernandez' description of her assailant on the day of the incident, that is 20 April 2000, and you know that her first, or the first recording of her description of her assailant came four days after the incident on 24 April 2000. You know that there is not any recording in her statement made 24 April 2000 of any feature of her assailant's eyes. You know the only recording of what she has said about any feature concerning her assailant's eyes is the recording made on 10 July 2000. And as to that, members of the jury, I omitted to refer in my reference to the witnesses to Inspector O'Connor, and he was the inspector who conducted the examination by Mrs. Fernandez of the 10 photographs on 10 July 2000. Whereas I said earlier there are five witnesses, there were in fact six witnesses, because I omitted to refer to Inspector O'Connor. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to what occurred on 10 July 2000, you have the transcript of the conversation. Inspector O'Connor said to you that he asked the pro forma questions and recorded the answers and you have the transcript of that conversation. 
         
        
        
         
         Members of the jury, you know that there was a delay between the incident on 20 April 2000 and firstly, Mr. Brown's examination of the photographs on 2 June, so six weeks have passed between the incident and his examination of the photographs, and you know that there was a delay between the incident on 20 April, and Mrs. Fernandez' examination of the photographs on 10 July, almost three months after the incident. 
         
        
        
         
         Members of the jury, what I have just said is relevant to the question of identification, and it's a further consideration for you when you assess identification. You may have wondered why I have, as it were, highlighted the need for care and caution, indeed, great care and caution in relation to the evidence of identification. The reason is that the courts have become aware over a long period of time that people make mistakes about identification. I have told you that I expect that each of you realises how easy it is to make mistakes. So the courts have become aware in cases where mistakes have occurred in identification, and therefore it is necessary for a presiding judge in a criminal trial to draw to the jury's attention, the fact that mistakes in identification happen, and therefore the need for the jury to use great care and caution when considering the evidence of identification."" 
         
        
       
     46 His Honour concluded his summing up by referring to the accused's case which was a denial of any involvement, and again put a direction to the jury on the necessity for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. 
      
       
     47 In the written submission filed on the appeal, it was contended that the trial judge had erred in failing to direct the jury expressly that the matters to which he did refer, although relevant to their assessment of identification, were matters which may cause the evidence to be unreliable. This submission is made notwithstanding the many, many times his Honour had told the jury of the necessity that they should subject the evidence to scrutiny with great care and caution before accepting it and that in that regard his Honour was plainly referring to those matters as relevant to the assessment of the reliability of the identification or resemblance evidence. It was also submitted that the trial judge had failed to draw to the jury's attention other matters which might have tended to undermine the reliability and strength of the identification evidence. Those matters included the absence of the appellant's fingerprints at the site and the possible wearing of sunglasses by the offender. 
      
       
     48 In the oral argument, senior counsel for the appellant proposed a direction which he said should have been given in respect of the evidence of Mr. Brown. That direction is as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""BYRNE: The evidence of Mr. Brown is that the photograph depicting the accused was possibly a photograph of the person who committed the offence. Mr. Brown also says that a photograph of some other person was possibly a photograph of the person who committed the offence. Mr. Brown's evidence in relation to his selection of the photograph of the accused may provide some support for the identification evidence given by Miss Fernandez but Mr. Brown's evidence regarding his selection of the other person as being the possible offender is of course evidence which suggests the accused is not guilty."" 
         
        
       
     49 It was contended that the absence of a direction concerning the selection of the other photograph as exculpatory was an important lapse. As I have said, no such direction was sought at trial. The effect of selection of the two photographs was not to make inconsistent identification but to refer to a common similarity between a feature of the offender and of the two photographs. That is how the effect of the evidence appeared to be perceived to be at trial. Mr. Brown's evidence was not left to the jury as identifying the accused as the offender. I would apply Rule 4 to reject the submission. 
      
       
     50 Although reliance was placed on the requirements of s.116 and s.165(1)(b) (which deals with identification evidence) and s.165(1)(c), (evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like), it was conceded in oral argument by Senior Counsel for the appellant that although those matters which might affect the reliability of the identification evidence should be drawn to the attention of the jury to comply with the requirements of those provisions, s.116(2) and s.165(4) have the effect that it is not necessary for those matters to be referred to as ""weaknesses"" since it is not necessary that they be referred to by any particular form of words. Section 165 applies if there is a relevant request. I have already referred to the extent of the directions requested to which s.165(2) might apply and to his Honour's directions which are in my view in compliance with s.165(2) and s.116. 
      
       
     51 However, in addition to the matters to which the accused's legal representative at the trial referred, and to the direction about Mr. Brown which it was said should have been given, in the oral argument our attention was drawn to two other matters. One was an inconsistency between the accounts of Ms. Fernandez and Mr. Brown that had not received specific mention in the summing up or in the submissions put to the trial judge by trial counsel. Mr. Brown said the person who committed the offence was wearing sunglasses. Ms. Fernandez said that she should never forget the piercing eyes of the person who attacked her. It was accepted that the two items of evidence were not logically and necessarily inconsistent, particularly having regard to evidence that, at the time, the assailant was wearing a hat. Mr. Brown had explained in evidence his reference to sunglasses:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. I notice you refer to sunglasses when you made your statement – sorry, on 2 June 2000 and there is no reference to sunglasses in your description given on the day. A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What are you able to say about that? A. I seem to recall sunglasses somewhere, whether they were Mona's (Ms. Fernandez) or mine or someone else's. Whether they were on the hat or whatever. I didn't mention it in the first one – it's hard to say, it all happened so quick. I don't think there was a pair but I just made mention of it in the discussion about basically what the man was wearing at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that was on 2 June? A. That's right, yeah."" 
         
        
       
     52 Ms. Fernandez had made reference in her evidence to her having had her own sunglasses with her at the time of the robbery. It is notable that Mr. Brown's reference to the sunglasses was at a time when he was examining the photographs which did not depict any person wearing sunglasses. I do not see this matter, having regard to s.165(2) and Mr. Brown's explanations, as founding any valid criticism of the evidence, directions or verdict. 
      
       
     53 The other matter to which senior counsel for the appellant on the appeal referred, but to which no reference was made at trial, concerned the period which Mr. Brown and Ms. Fernandez had to observe the assailant. Mr. Brown said in chief that the incident lasted ""only a second or two"". In cross-examination he said it took between five and 10 seconds. In his summing up the trial judge said it took 15 seconds. IN view of the difficulty in making precise assessments of the passing of time, nothing the trial judge said or failed to say about the brevity of the observation period could possibly create any risk of a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     54 It was submitted by the Crown that the directions as given at trial were entirely adequate and sufficient. It was submitted that the trial judge in respect of the matters to which he referred had warned the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, informed the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable and warned the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it, thus complying with s. 116 and s.165(2). It was pointed out that both sections expressly provide that no particular form of words need be used. 
      
       
     55 Having regard to the issues arising in this case, and in particular having regard to the direction given as to the limited utility of the evidence of Mr. Brown, I am of the view that the summing up was entirely adequate to meet the requirements of s.116 and s.165, as those requirements are to be regarded as informed by the views of the High Court expressed prior to the passing of the Evidence Act in Domican (supra) (see also Festa (supra)). The necessary content of the relevant warning is identified in Domican (supra) at 562 in the judgment of the majority: ""it must be appropriate to the circumstances of the case … the judge should (in a direction which has the authority of the judge's office behind it) isolate and identify for the benefit of the jury any matter of significance which may reasonably be regarded as undermining the reliability of the identification evidence"". In my view these directions did just that. 
      
       
     56 I am confirmed in my view by the discussion on the application of those requirements in The Queen v. Cook (supra). In my view those requirements here were adequately met. In the judgment of Dunford, J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, it is held that it is not necessary in the identification directions for the judge to lend his judicial authority to every argument available to defence counsel on the evidence. Nor is it necessary for the judge to draw attention to every disparity in observed physical features in the assailant as noted by different witnesses. That case dealt with a material discrepancy concerning the nature of the assailant's hair. The trial judge did not specifically direct the jury's attention to the different descriptions of the hair. No application for relevant further directions was sought. The evidence of one of the witnesses amounted only to resemblance evidence as referred to in Pitkin (supra). It was held that any deficiency could no doubt have been corrected by the trial judge if he had been asked to do so. Those remarks are appropriate here. 
      
       
     57 The one major factual deficiency referred to here concerns the question of sunglasses. It was not referred to the trial judge below by any particular request. The evidence concerning that matter is not such as to be necessarily contradictory. It did not appear to have been regarded as significant at trial by trial counsel who was assiduous to put every other argument perceived by her to be an advantage to her client to the trial judge to seek appropriate redirections. 
      
       
     58 I am unable to conclude that there is any such deficiency as would merit any criticism such as is made here of the summing up. 
      
       
     59 The submissions made concerning the context of the Crown Prosecutor's cross-examination and the suggestion that the jury could better have been directed concerning the absence of the accused's fingerprints in the context of the door not having been secured, in my view do not suggest such significance as would enable any criticism of the directions concerning identification to have such force as to support the ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       Ground three 
        
       
     60 In substance, as argued, this ground contends that, because one witness asserting a definite identification was only supported on the crucial question by evidence of resemblance submitted to be ambiguous where the witness, 77 days after her observation identified her assailant from a photograph, the evidence was not such as might reasonably be considered as sufficient to support the verdict. There is no doubt that there was an unusually long delay. There was, however, a description consistent with the appearance of the accused afforded to the police within four days after the event. The identification was, it is true, a most definite one. It is not necessarily bad for that. It was submitted that the identification was similar to that of a witness who had been described as being ""mistaken at the top of her voice"". That submission depends upon an assertion of unreliability. 
      
       
     61 The credibility of the witness and the reliability of the witness' account were matters which were squarely before the jury and matters upon which, in my view, the jury was entirely properly directed. The assessment of whether or not reliance could be placed upon that witness' identification of the appellant and, in particular, her identification of the appellant has having piercing eyes, was very much a matter for the jury, particularly having regard to the fact that they could see the appellant in court. 
      
       
     62 In my view there is no substance in this ground of appeal either. 
      
       
     63 I am of the view that the appeal should be dismissed and for the reasons that I have earlier given that leave to appeal against sentence should be refused.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Christine Ann Gifford has pleaded not guilty to the charge that on 18 July 2000 at Drake New South Wales she murdered Megan Rose Gifford. She has elected for trial by judge alone and the Crown has consented to that form of trial. I shall explain when I review the psychiatric evidence why I think it appropriate that the accused should be tried without a jury.2 The deceased child, Megan Rose Gifford, was killed by ligature strangulation on 18 July 2000. The accused, who was the mother of the child, does not remember the circumstances of her death and that has had consequences. First, she has not given evidence. I draw no inference against the accused from her decision not to give evidence, which is explained by her amnesia alone. Her silence may not be used to fill in any gap in the Crown case, which is a circumstantial one. A second consequence is that the accused has not challenged any of the evidence on which the Crown relies. It has therefore been possible for the Crown to present its case by the tender of the written statements of its witnesses. 3 The evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did the act which caused the death of the child. Counsel for the accused, Mr Bruce, impliedly accepts that that is so. Although he has made no formal admission or concession on behalf of the accused, he has not made any submission to challenge the conclusion that the accused did the act causing death. The substantial issue raised by the accused’s plea of not guilty is whether, assuming that she did the act causing death, she was mentally ill and therefore not legally responsible for her actions. She must prove that it is more likely than not that that was so.4 The accused and the father of the child separated when the child was about two years of age. By early 2000 the accused and the child were living in Cairns, North Queensland. The accused was very friendly with Mrs Elizabeth Kinneir-Tarte, who lived not far from the village of Drake in northern New South Wales. During June the accused and the child were living on the property of the accused’s friend Mr Phillip Dugon, in Long Gully Road, Drake. Mrs Kinneir-Tarte and her husband lived not far away. The accused and the child often visited Mrs Kinneir-Tarte, who was like a mother to the accused. They left her premises together on the evening of 15 July 2000. On the following Monday, 17 July, the accused called at Mrs Kinneir-Tarte’s house and said that she and the child were leaving for Warwick where the child was due to resume school. Later that afternoon someone from the school telephoned Mrs Kinneir-Tarte, saying that the accused had just spoken to her by telephone saying that there were family problems and that the child would be late back at school.5 Mr Dugon left for work at 4:30am on Tuesday 18 July. The child was then alive and in the company of the accused. 6 During the same morning Mrs Kinneir-Tarte telephoned the house where the accused and her friend were living but was unable to speak to the accused. She managed to leave a message for her, however, and later spoke to her face-to-face. She remonstrated with her for not having returned the child to school and asked where she was. All the accused would say was that the child was not there. Knowing that the accused had had no contact with her family for many years, Mrs Kinneir-Tarte asked what the family problems were that she had told the school about. The accused said that it was about her brother but refused to say more. She said that her brother had the child. Mrs Kinneir-Tarte left, upset. During the same afternoon the accused telephoned her and said that the child was well. 7 At about midday the accused asked permission of neighbours to borrow their utility truck, as she said, to take rubbish to the tip. They declined to lend her the vehicle but offered to drive her and collect and dispose of the rubbish. When they went to Mr Dugon’s house they saw only bags of clothes. There was no rubbish which would warrant the need for a vehicle of the kind the accused was wanting. 8 The accused told Mr Dugon that her brother had come from Queensland to collect the child and had taken her to Brisbane to live with him and his family, following arrangements that had been made a long time ago. Mr Dugon spoke to Mrs Kinneir-Tarte and they compared the versions the accused had told them. They suspected that something was amiss.9 On Wednesday 19 July the accused requested Mr Dugon to take her to Lifeline in Lismore for crisis counselling. When he arrived at his house to collect the accused he noticed a sheet on the line. The bed was disturbed. There were bags of what looked like clothing. The accused told him that the child had wet the bed during the night, something the child would not ordinarily do. She told Mr Dugon that the bags contained clothing which the child had outgrown. Mr Dugon was suspicious as the only property belonging to the child at the house comprised school requisites which she ought to have taken with her to school. Mr Dugon took the accused to Lifeline and on the way the accused told him that she wanted to dispose of the child’s old clothes. He became even more concerned when he realised that the clothes in the bags were not old. 10 Mr Dugon told the counsellors about his concerns and the accused was asked where the child was. She repeated to the counsellors that she was at the accused’s brother’s house in Brisbane. She was unable to put the counsellors in touch with her brother, however. The counsellors called the police and the accused repeated to the police that the child was with her brother. The police contacted the brother and he told them that he had not seen the child for several years.11 The search was begun for the child and her body was found about one hundred metres from Mr Dugon’s house. She had been strangled by a length of rope, which was wound tightly around her neck. Police found the rope and a bloodstained sloppy joe in a bag containing the accused’s property. The sloppy joe belonged to the accused. The rope was examined and DNA taken from it. It matched DNA taken from the accused but not DNA taken from the child. Blood on the sloppy joe could have come from the child but not from the accused. A small bloodstain, which could have come from the child, was found on a sheet. There was blood around the nose and right eye of the body of the child. There were bloodstains on the sleeves of the pyjamas she was wearing.12 The evidence I have summarised makes for a strong circumstantial case. The child was last seen alive at 4:30am on 18 July in the company of the accused. The objective signs show that the child was killed at Mr Dugon’s house. The time of death was estimated as being between 4:30am and 11:30am on 18 July 2000. The only other occupant of the house, Mr Dugon, was absent during those hours. The accused asked to borrow a utility truck for which she had apparently no use if she were not intending to use it to transport the body of the child. She attempted to dispose of the child’s clothing and school items. She attempted to dispose of her own sloppy joe which bore blood which may have been the child’s. She washed the bed-sheet and gave what was probably a false explanation for the need to do so. When asked where the child was she gave a false explanation.13 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on this evidence that on the morning of 18 July 2000 the accused strangled the child, intending as she did so to kill her.14 The statement of the test for a defence of mental illness was propounded as long ago as 1843 in R v McNaghten. The question to be answered was whether the accused at the time the offence was committed was suffering from a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, so as not to know the quality and nature of the act she was doing or, if she did know it, that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong. The law has been amplified in Australia during the last one hundred years and the test may be said to be whether the accused was able to appreciate the wrongness of the act that she was doing. If through disordered condition of the mind she could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that she could not know that what she was doing was wrong. It may also be said that if a disease of the mind so governs the faculties that it is impossible to reason with some moderate degree of calmness about the moral quality of an act, the actor is prevented from knowing that what she does is wrong.15 The accused is thirty-two years of age. She has enjoyed good physical health throughout her life though at fifteen she developed a hernia which was successfully repaired by operation and at sixteen contracted Ross River fever which affected her badly. There is a family history of psychiatric disorder. The accused’s first hospital admission for psychiatric purposes was to the Cairns District hospital in September 1999. However, her symptoms had begun in 1995 or 1996. At that time she became afraid of the Devil and of evil demons and played a lot of Christian music on tapes apparently in an attempt to protect herself. Concerns of that kind continued until her admission in 1999 and beyond. Her first symptoms included thinking on a couple of occasions that the child was possessed by the Devil. She noticed that her eyes changed from brown to black. That sometimes happened with other people as well. The accused had a sense that she had been given a special gift or power to connect with God and for a while she thought that she was God on earth. She experienced auditory hallucinations in the form of whispers and occasionally words. She thought that they were from angels because they were gentle and quiet. She felt very proud because she had been chosen to be someone special. Her only fear was of demons and devils and of people watching her. Motor vehicle number plates took on special meanings which she could interpret.16 In 1998 and 1999 the good feelings had all disappeared. She was concerned about bikies and members of the Secret Service. In 1998 she attended a party at the home of one of her work superiors and noticed that the walls in one of the rooms were covered in press cuttings about people who had been murdered or dismembered. It seems likely that that actually happened. She told a police officer that drugs had been distributed at the party. 17 Symptoms of that kind were present when she was admitted to the Cairns District hospital in September 1999. Her admission was precipitated by fears about pesticide spray. She had seen a vehicle from a pest control company that looked as though it had been spraying. She thought that someone must have thought it a good way to get rid of her. On her admission she discussed these and other symptoms. She said that often when someone walked towards her they looked familiar but when they were closer they turned out to be strangers. She would see “ghosts” over their face. She also saw ghosts by themselves. She thought that ghosts could look at her through strangers. She thought that the internal energy of angels could be transported into strangers. She had feelings and beliefs about soul transfer, the soul moving from one person to another. In 1995 or 1996 she had felt that her soul had gone across the road into an American person and had been transported overseas. She was still fearful of bikie gangs and the Secret Service.18 In February 2000 she was admitted again to Cairns hospital. Her landlady noticed that she was acting strangely and took her there. The accused thought that she could see people in the house. She had had an experience at the airport, believing that the child had been taken away by someone who was looking after her. She believed that she could see guards in the garden watching her closely. There were vans equipped with technical devices and cameras. 19 Each time she was admitted to hospital she was treated and discharged with medication. On each occasion she stopped taking the medication.20 The history which I have summarised is taken from the report of Dr William Lucas, one of the three psychiatrists who has seen the accused and has provided a report for the Court.21 Dr Lucas is of the opinion that at the time of her admissions to Cairns hospital the accused was suffering from a psychotic episode with affective features, or schizo-affective disorder. He thinks that the description of her presentation is consistent with a psychotic disorder with marked disturbance of thought, incongruent affect, active auditory hallucinations and some grandiosity. He noted that for much of the admission she was grossly thought disordered and “almost delusional”. She did not disclose to any extent her delusional beliefs, however, which were present but accompanied by great fear. Although there was improvement on medication her insight remained poor. 22 After the accused’s arrest she was taken to Richmond Clinic in Lismore on 20 July 2000. The description of her condition there is consistent in Dr Lucas’ opinion with a severe psychosis with wide-ranging symptoms including visual, auditory and somatic hallucinations. Dr Lucas observes that partial, and occasionally total, amnesia for violent events is common to those who commit them and that important factors influencing amnesia include depression and psychosis. He thinks that the accused’s psychosis was of a severe degree and appears to accept her claim of amnesia. 23 Dr Lucas thinks that when she killed the child the accused was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, which is a disease of the mind. He thinks that she was probably aware of the nature and quality of her act but, because of her mental illness, unable to reason about its rightness or wrongness with a moderate degree of sense and composure. Due to an elaborate delusional system and auditory and visual hallucinations she had long feared for the safety of herself and her daughter. In the circumstances she could not have reasoned about the wrongness of her act with any degree of sense and composure. In Dr Lucas’ opinion the defence of mental illness is available to the accused. 24 The psychiatrist who has seen most of the accused since her arrest is Dr Giuffrida. He has been treating her at Mulawa Correctional Centre Silverwater, where she has been held since July 2000. Dr Giuffrida notes that on her admission to hospital at Lismore after her arrest the accused was seen by Dr O’Dea, psychiatrist who diagnosed a schizophrenic episode and began treating her with anti-psychotic medication. Dr Giuffrida has made an extensive review of the medical records of the accused. He notes that she told Dr O’Dea that recent events were a blur and that she could not accept that her daughter was dead. She spoke of hearing voices and said that she had often heard her thoughts spoken aloud.25 When he examined her on 1 August 2000 Dr Giuffrida found the accused vague and perplexed and apparently having no recollection of the events surrounding the child’s death. She believed that the child was still at boarding school and that she would see her soon. She described auditory hallucinations and delusional ideas of persecution. The fears were of the kind described by Dr Lucas.26 On the basis of his finding of thought disorder, auditory and possibly visual hallucinations and delusions, Dr Giuffrida diagnosed schizophrenia. The accused demonstrated what Dr Giuffrida referred to as first rank symptoms of schizophrenia, for example the belief that people could hear her thoughts and the experience of hearing her own thoughts spoken aloud. Dr Giuffrida continued to see the accused. She was transferred to Cumberland hospital on 28 August 2000 and has remained there since. 27 Like Dr Lucas, Dr Giuffrida reviewed in detail the admissions to Cairns hospital. He noted that for about twelve months up to April 1999 the accused was working for a mobile telephone company, selling contracts, and developed the delusional ideas that the phone service was evil and emitting dangerous radiations that were affecting her brain. She believed that the radio waves could read her thoughts and that people that owned or operated the mobile phones were reading her thoughts and that it was all somehow related to the Devil.28 Dr Giuffrida has reviewed the movements of the accused from one place of living to another, motivated to a large degree by delusional fear, but there is no need to deal here with the details. Dr Giuffrida also believes that the accused has suffered from increasingly intense and disruptive delusional ideas since 1995 and that the delusions appear to have arisen because she made certain disclosures to the police about persons she thought were drug dealers. From that she developed the paranoid persecutory delusion that people she had so identified were trying to avenge themselves upon her. She developed a belief that such people would kidnap the child, cut off parts of her and send them in the mail. He thought that the accused’s description of the change of colour of people’s eyes may have been a form of visual hallucination but that it was more likely that they were a delusion of perception. He thought that the experience of swapping souls with other people was clearly delusional.29 Dr Giuffrida is of the opinion that if it is found that the accused caused the death of the child, a defect of reasoning based on two kinds of delusional beliefs caused her inability to appreciate the wrongness of the act. The first was her solidly entrenched delusional conviction that her daughter’s life was at great risk. The second, namely that she had swapped souls with the child, signified to her that the child was possessed by the Devil and would do her harm. He observed that delusions of those kinds are of the most common kind occurring in psychotic women suffering from diseases such as schizophrenia who take the life of their children. He is of the opinion that the defence of mental illness is available to the accused. 30 Dr Neilssen, psychiatrist, has interviewed the accused on behalf of the Crown and has reviewed the medical and other records. He diagnoses chronic schizophrenia. He thinks that at the time of the death of the child the accused was suffering from a defect of reason in the form of bizarre persecutory beliefs that were typical of acute schizophrenia. He noted that there were many cases in which the delusional belief that a loved one has become possessed by the Devil has resulted in pre-emptive assaults and even homicides.31 He is of the view that the severe disturbance of logical and reasoning ability arising from acute mental illness probably deprived the accused of her ability to understand that her actions were morally wrong. 32 The opinions of the three psychiatrists well establish that when she killed the child the accused did not, because of her mental illness, appreciate that what she was doing was wrong. Accordingly she must be found not guilty on the ground of mental illness.33 Since being held in custody the accused has been treated. Dr Giuffrida has been concerned to ensure that she is now fit to be tried and is satisfied that she is fit. Although she has no previous experience with the Court, she has demonstrated to Dr Giuffrida that she understands the role of all the participants in the legal process and the significance of a plea of guilty or not guilty. I do not mention these matters in order to deal with any question whether the accused is fit to be tried, for no such question is raised. However, these remarks and opinions of Dr Giuffrida do demonstrate that the accused was well able to understand the issues concerned and to elect in an informed way for trial by judge alone.34 The statute which governs cases like this requires me to make an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice that will mean that the accused will be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1990. A strict statutory regime will then come into effect. 
     
      
    35 The Mental Health Review Tribunal is a body of professional experts. Within 14 days after the verdict the Tribunal will commence a review of the case of the accused. When it has done its review the Tribunal will make a recommendation to the Minister for Health. That recommendation may be either unconditional or subject to conditions as to the manner in which the accused should be detained, cared for or treated. If the Tribunal is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by her release, it may make a recommendation as to her release. If it makes such a recommendation that will be considered by the Department of Health which in turn will advise the Governor-in-Council. The Governor-in-Council will then, in accordance with the recommendation and advice, either make an order for the detention of the accused or for her release, conditional or unconditional. The Governor-in-Council may only make an order for release where the Tribunal itself has recommended release. Assuming that no recommendation for release is made after the first hearing the Mental Health Review Tribunal can at any later time, and must at least once every six months, review the case of the accused. 
     
      
    36 After hearing the evidence at any later review, it must make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the continued detention, care or treatment of the accused or as to her release, conditional or unconditional. The Tribunal is not free at any such review to make a recommendation for release unless it is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by her release. Again following such a review and recommendation the matter goes to the Department of Health and the Minister advises the Governor-in-Council. Any recommendation so advised can be carried into effect only by order of the Governor-in-Council. 
     
      
    37 If the accused were at any time released back into the public on conditions and there were a breach of any of those conditions, the Governor-in-Council might order that the accused be apprehended and detained. Such an order would follow by reason of the practical consideration that if a person were released, the Department of Health would maintain a watch over her case with the assistance of a Community Health Centre, a private psychiatrist, or one of the other public facilities available. In other words, if a person is released conditionally back into the community, then the Department maintains a watch over her and a breach of any condition will lead to her being apprehended and detained once again. 
     
      
    38 The conditions which could be applied include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication and so on, to ensure that the accused was properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions catering for forensic patients. 
     
      
    39 The only manner in which a person ceases to be a forensic patient for the purposes of these provisions is by unconditional release by the Governor-in-Council, or release upon conditions which include a condition as to the time that the release should become unconditional. If that time expires, then the release becomes unconditional and the accused ceases to be a forensic patient. However, as I previously explained, the accused will never be released unless the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that her safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered.40 I find that the accused is not guilty of the charge by reason of mental illness. I order that she be detained at the Bunya Unit at Cumberland Hospital or such other place as may be determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

      70061/01 - REGINA v Leanne Patricia MABBOTT 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Leanne Patricia Mabbott, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of David John Mabbott at his home at Toongabbie on 2 October, 2000. The Crown has accepted that plea in discharge of an indictment for murder. 
     
      
    2 The deceased, who was eleven years older than the offender, was her step-brother. They had been in a de facto relationship for about three years, although at the time of the killing they were living apart. Their relationship had been affectionate but it was also turbulent, characterised by violence on both sides. 
     
      
    3 On the night in question the offender and the deceased were at his home, where they had drinks with friends who lived nearby. The friends left in the mid evening, at which time the offender and the deceased appeared to be in good spirits. Some hours later the offender arrived at the friends’ home, stained with blood and obviously distressed, saying that she had stabbed the deceased in the neck and had killed him. The friends took her back to the deceased’s home where they found him lying in the bedroom. Police were summoned to the scene, and to them the offender repeatedly said that she had stabbed and killed her “bubba”, apparently a reference to the deceased. It was later established that the deceased had died as a result of a single stab wound to the neck. 
     
      
    4 In a recorded interview with police the offender was uncommunicative. However, she has since provided a consistent account of what she can recall of the fatal incident to several psychiatrists. It seems that both she and the deceased had had a good deal to drink that day. After their friends had left the deceased retired to bed. The offender cooked a meal and ate it. The deceased emerged from the bedroom and she asked him if he wanted dinner. He seized her and threw her to the floor, calling her a “dog.” When she got up he pushed her back down, again calling her a dog. To the psychiatrists, and in evidence before me, she said that she does not remember the stabbing which must then have occurred. Her next recollection is seeing the deceased standing, bleeding and holding his hand to his neck. She called the 000 emergency line and he went to the bedroom, where he collapsed. She went to his aid and wrapped him in a doona before going to their friends’ home.  
     
      
    5 The Crown has accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind, within the meaning of s 23A of the Crimes Act. It is necessary to sketch the offender’s background before turning to the opinion of the psychiatrists about that matter. 
     
      
    6 The offender was thirty five years old at the time of the offence and is now thirty seven. She has a fairly lengthy criminal record, commencing when she was seventeen years old, although all the offences were such as could be dealt with summarily. She has served several short terms of imprisonment. There are a number of entries for assault, although the manner of their disposition suggests that none of them was particularly serious. Otherwise, the record consists mainly of street offences and offences of dishonesty. It is consistent with her background and her lifestyle throughout her adult years.  
     
      
    7 The offender was born in Victoria. Her parents separated when she was only three. It seems that her father was an alcoholic who was prone to violence. Her mother remarried two years later, and her stepfather treated her well. Nevertheless, she was frequently disciplined at home and her behaviour worsened when her younger sister was born. It appeared to her that her mother devoted most of her attention to the sister, of whom she became jealous. There were episodes of destructive behaviour and she ran away from home on several occasions. Her mother died in 1993. 
     
      
    8 The family moved to the north coast of New South Wales while she was still in primary school. She was educated to school certificate standard, although her schooling was disrupted by her errant behaviour. Indeed, at the ages of twelve and thirteen she spent two short periods in children’s homes because of it. After leaving school, she did a secretarial course. 
     
      
    9 At the age of sixteen she was raped by three men. She reported the matter to police, but it seems that they did not accept her account of the incident and no-one was charged. At the same age she began drinking alcohol and soon became a binge drinker. She also used cannabis and, from the age of about eighteen, heroin. Her use of alcohol moderated after she took to heroin, and her level of intoxication at the time of the killing was atypical. She continued to use cannabis and heroin throughout her adult years, and it seems that much of her criminal record is drug related. 
     
      
    10 After she was raped she spent about six months living on the street, sometimes sleeping with men whom she picked up at a hotel. When she was seventeen she moved to Melbourne to live with her grandmother. As a result of an assault upon her grandmother she spent a short period of time in Pentridge Prison. After her release she was introduced to prostitution, which became her main occupation. Her life thereafter was described by one of the psychiatrists as “extremely chaotic”, characterised by tumultuous relationships, alcohol and drug abuse and conflict with the criminal law.  
     
      
    11 Each of three relationships with men led to the birth of a child. As a result of the first, which lasted for a year or so, she has a son who is now about sixteen years old. The second, which was short-lived, produced a daughter who is about thirteen. The third relationship was with the deceased and it produced another son, Ashleigh, who was born in 1998. He is in foster care, while the two older children are in the care of the offender’s stepfather. 
     
      
    12 The deceased was her step-father’s son from his first marriage. It seems that the offender had little contact with him during her childhood, although the evidence about this is scanty. She got in touch with him after her release from prison in 1997, he offered her accommodation and the relationship developed. It was turbulent, as I have said, although the offender has acknowledged that he was violent to her only when he had been drinking. This case is all the more tragic because it appears that this relationship, for all its problems, was the best she had ever had. In evidence she said of the deceased, “… he was my friend, he was my lover, he was everything to me.” 
     
      
    13 It seems that the offender saw a psychiatrist on a couple of occasions during her childhood, but there is no evidence of the outcome of those consultations. In early 2000 she was admitted to Cumberland Hospital with psychotic symptoms following her ingestion of a large amount of amphetamines, and while she was at that hospital she displayed the symptoms of temporal lobe epilepsy. An EEG conducted since her arrest for the present matter displays some atrophy of the left temporal lobe, although the psychiatric evidence is inconclusive about the bearing this might have upon her behaviour at the time of the killing.  
     
      
    14 Of greater significance is her history of paranoid delusions since the birth of the child, Ashleigh. She told the psychiatrists of her belief that she was being watched and, indeed, she came to believe that the deceased was watching her at the behest of the prison authorities at Mulawa, apparently because his work uniform was the same colour as the uniform worn by prison officers. This led her on one occasion to cut off an arm of all his shirts and take them to his place of employment, where she dumped them on his desk. 
     
      
    15 That said, there is no evidence that the killing was the direct result of a paranoid delusion. I accept that she has no recollection of the stabbing itself. To the psychiatrists she was at a loss to explain it except to say that she might have been angered by his calling her a dog which, of course, is a particularly offensive term to someone who has been a prisoner. All the psychiatrists who examined her concluded that she was suffering from a schizophrenic illness at the time. Dr Michael Guiffrida considered that she had the defence of mental illness. This also appears to have been the view of Dr Brian Boettcher, who concluded that “she had suffered from a break from reality of sufficient severity to impair her capacities as required in law to excuse her …”. However, two well known forensic psychiatrists, Dr Bruce Westmore and Dr Olav Neilssen, supported the defence of substantial impairment: Dr Westmore on the basis that she had suffered “an episode of disassociation during the critical time” and Dr Neilssen on the basis that her mental state “probably had a substantial effect on her judgment and perception of events, as she is likely to have interpreted events in the context of her paranoid delusions.”  
     
      
    16 Upon her reception at Mulawa after her arrest for this offence, the offender was found to be mentally ill and was transferred to the Bunya Unit at Cumberland Hospital as a forensic patient. In large part, this was because of her refusal to accept treatment for cervical cancer which, apparently, had been first diagnosed as long ago as 1995. In a report of March 2001, Dr Giuffrida described gradual but significant improvement at that unit, with a positive response to medication. In a report of September 2001, Dr Boettcher considered that she was “trying to understand in a distant sort of way what has been happening to her”. However, he expressed concern about her provocative and abusive conduct towards other patients, which he saw as a reflection of her personality quite apart from any mental illness. In evidence she acknowledged this behaviour, although she said that many of her altercations with other patients were not initiated by her. She agreed that, as her mental health improved, she did not fit in as well with other patients. 
     
      
    17 She underwent radiotherapy at Westmead Hospital for the cancer which, happily, appears to have been successful. Nevertheless, a report of January 2002 from Dr C A Bull, medical director of radiation oncology at that hospital, expresses a guarded prognosis. As that treatment has been completed and her mental health has improved, she has now been discharged from the Bunya Unit and returned to Mulawa. There she has been working and undergoing various courses, including accounting. She recognises that she still has a mental illness and maintains a regime of medication. She has also participated in a Naltrexone program to deal with her drug problem. 
     
      
    18 Clearly, her position has improved considerably during the period she has been in custody. Her presentation in evidence before me was markedly different from what might have been expected from a reading of the psychiatric reports and the other material. She was well groomed and articulate, and appeared sincere in her expressed resolve to pursue her rehabilitation. She said that she wishes to re-establish her relationship with Ashleigh, who has been brought to visit her in custody on a number of occasions. She wants to complete her accountancy course and, eventually, to practise in that profession. She intends to pursue her interest in the guitar and, upon her release, to form a circle of friends. She does not have contact with her sister and, understandably in the circumstances, her relationship with her stepfather is strained. Nevertheless, she said that she enjoys the support of an aunt and uncle who live in Victoria. 
     
      
    19 This is not to deny that much needs to be done to turn her life around. Dr Westmore and Dr Neilssen both expressed the view that she needs long term psychiatric treatment, Dr Neilssen adding that she requires the assistance of a drug and alcohol service for a lengthy period. Both Dr Neilssen and Dr Boettcher concluded that, apart from her schizophrenic illness, she suffers from a personality disorder with borderline traits. Dr Boettcher had this to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “I believe that she will continue to be at risk of a recurrence of the psychosis and that this may worsen if the temporal lobe damage and resultant epilepsy worsens or if she is again involved in substance abuse. This would lead to the possibility of a loss of critical judgment and the possibility of violent episodes again. 
        
       
       
        
        Risk management will involve the active and, compulsory if necessary, treatment and repeated assessment by mental health staff to track her progress and suggest ways of reducing life stresses.” 
        
       
      
    20 Clearly, her long history of aggressive behaviour, including that observed in the Bunya Unit, is of concern. Nevertheless, I believe that her prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable. Given the progress she has made so far, and with appropriate management in the future, there is reason to be hopeful that she will not re-offend in a violent way.  
     
      
    21 I have regard to her plea of guilty to manslaughter, although this is not a case where it would be appropriate to recognise that plea by a quantified reduction of the sentence otherwise appropriate. It is sufficient to say that, as she has no recollection of the stabbing and there is evidence supporting the defence of mental illness, I view the plea as a demonstration of her acceptance of her responsibility for the death of the unfortunate victim. That said, I am mindful of the seriousness of this crime involving, as it does, the unlawful killing of a human being. I take into account her mental state at the time and her psychiatric history, together with the other mitigating factors, but appropriate effect must be given to consideration of retribution and deterrence.  
     
      
    22 Clearly, there are special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between sentence and non-parole period. So much is common ground. The offender has been in custody since her arrest in the early hours of 3 October 2000. 
     
      
    23 Leanne Patricia Mabbott, you are sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, to date from 3 October 2000, with a non parole period of three and a half years. You will be eligible for release on parole on 3 April 2004.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: In November 1981, the applicant David Gregory stood trial, together with Michelle Heaney and Victor Hitchcock, on a charge that, between 1 August 1980 and 11 April 1981, he did conspire with his two co-accused, Peter Wong and diverse other persons to import a prohibited drug, heroin. A verdict of not guilty by direction was entered in relation to Heaney; and the applicant and Hitchcock were found guilty by the jury. Shannon DCJ sentenced the applicant to seven years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. That sentence has now been fully served. 
      
       
     2 On 15 February 1999, the applicant applied for an extension of time to appeal against his conviction, on the stated ground “Fresh evidence from the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service”. In a statement of grounds of appeal dated 20 April 2001, this was expressed as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         There now exists fresh evidence that demonstrates the Appellant’s conviction was a miscarriage of justice. 
         
        
       
     3 At the hearing of the application for extension of time, the applicant sought to rely on two additional grounds as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The trial judge erred in failing to give an accomplice direction about the evidence of Victor Hitchcock. 
          
          
         2. The trial judge erred by failing to direct the jury adequately concerning the unsigned record of interview allegedly made by the applicant. 
         
        
        
       CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
     4 In the 1981 trial, the Crown case was that the initial agreement to import heroin was made between the applicant and Wong while they were in prison together, and that later Hitchcock among others became a party to the agreement. Hitchcock carried the heroin into Australia, and Hitchcock and the applicant were arrested a week later. Police gave evidence that, on 10 April 1981, they entered premises occupied by the applicant, he was ordered to undress, and a small plastic bag containing heroin fell from his clothing. It was alleged that the applicant said it was “some of the dope that Vic brought in”.  
      
       
     5 The applicant was taken to Remington Centre, where he was interviewed by Detective Sergeant Sweeney between 10am and 7.35pm. Detective Sergeant Johnston typed a record of interview, and handed it to the applicant. It was alleged that the applicant read it, agreed it was correct, but refused to sign it. Sergeant Chapman gave evidence that he asked the applicant formal questions about the interview, and that the applicant said that the record of interview was accurate, and made of his own free will, and he had no complaints. The record of interview was not admitted into evidence, but was used to refresh the memory of Sweeney and Johnston. According to their evidence, the applicant made admissions of guilt in that interview.  
      
       
     6 The Crown also relied on circumstantial evidence as corroborating the admissions claimed to have been made by the applicant to the Police. Hitchcock gave sworn evidence to the effect that he was coerced into participating by the applicant. The applicant made an unsworn statement in which he gave an explanation of the circumstantial evidence, and said that the record of interview was a fabrication. 
      
       
        
       FRESH EVIDENCE 
       
     7 On the application for extension of time, there was an affidavit from the applicant that he did not previously appeal because his solicitor advised him there was no point, because the appeal would not be heard before he was released on parole. In 1999, he saw a poster about people being wrongly convicted by evidence given by corrupt police, and he applied for legal aid to have his conviction reviewed.  
      
       
     8 There was also an affidavit from the applicant’s solicitor David Barrow, asserting that the investigation that led to the arrest of the applicant and Hitchcock was an investigation by the Joint Task Force into Drug Trafficking (JTF); and that the Police Royal Commission had reviewed a number of these investigations.  
      
       
     9 The affidavit asserted that an officer JTF10 gave evidence at the Royal Commission that he accompanied Sergeant Johnston to Hong Kong in 1983 and was present during an interview between Johnston and Wong; and that when he returned to Australia, he prepared a statement. He gave the following evidence concerning these matters at the Royal Commission: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Let me just put in your hands what appears to be a copy of your statement in this matter of the police against Wong. It is a document dated 3 November 1983. Do you identify your signature at the bottom of each page of that statement?  
          
         A. Yes, my signature is there on the right-hand corner of each page. 
          
          
         Q. And this was a statement to be prepared as part of the brief. Indeed, it was part of the brief of evidence against Mr Wong, was it not? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. And it was from that document that you gave your evidence, which was later disputed in court? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. I just want to take you to the portion that you say was fabricated. There is on page 9 and following a record of a lengthy conversation between Detective Johnston and Mr Wong with you present; do you see that? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Was it to part of that conversation that you were referring? 
          
         A. Yes, it is. 
          
          
         Q. Perhaps you might indicate by reference to the page. Then if you could read that portion of the statement which you say represents the fabrication? 
          
         A. Yes. There's a section there where: 
          
           
           Johnston spread some letters out on the table and Wong appeared to look at them and he shook his head and said, ""Stupid, stupid, stupid, why has he kept these? Mr Johnston, why am I always surrounded by fools? Anyway, there is nothing here about conspiracy. It is jobs that I asked him to do for my court case. I don't write nothing about conspiracy. You show me where."" 
           
          
         From my recollection, that is part of what Wong disputed having said, and my memory is that he may well be correct there, that some of those things weren't said. 
          
          
         Q. When you say ""he may well be correct"", what do you mean by that? 
          
         A. Well, it's been a long time, you know, it's 12, 13 years, and that particular conversation is quite lengthy. Parts of it, I believe, are correct and other parts are not correct. It's very difficult to pinpoint which category the conversation falls into. But I can recall his reply about, ""Stupid, stupid, stupid"" wasn't an answer he gave. 
          
          
         Q. How did it come about that a record of this conversation which was false was put together? 
          
         A. Well, later on when we returned to Australia, the brief was put together and Johnston was responsible for putting this particular brief together and I discussed with him what our evidence would be and I think I even wrote up my notebook to include this conversation in my notebook. 
          
          
         Q. Did you do that after you got back to Australia? 
          
         A. Yes, I'm pretty sure I did. 
          
          
         Q. Can you recall whether there are any other portions of this alleged conversation which are fabricated? 
          
         A. Well, not specifically, no. I've had a look at the record of interview which followed this conversation and it doesn't appear to be that any of the conversation was repeated in the formal record of interview. But it’s difficult now to recall which parts were correct and which one weren’t. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         Q. And can you recall whether or not there were other members of the task force involved in that fabrication, aside from you and him? 
          
         A. No, I don't think there were. 
          
          
         Q. Again, this was a case, was it, where you believed that Mr Wong was properly accused of the matter? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. In fabricating this evidence, did you have any thought that you might have been contributing towards the conviction of a person who was innocent? 
          
         A. That wasn't even a consideration, in my view. There was no doubt that Wong was guilty of these matters. 
          
          
         Q. So then why did you assist in fabricating this portion of the evidence? 
          
         A. I think again it is simply a case of making a tighter brief of evidence. 
          
          
         Q. Mr Johnston was formerly - was, he still is - at that time a member of the New South Wales Police Service? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
       
     10 The affidavit also referred to evidence given at the Royal Commission by Detective Haken that money taken at a raid on a cocaine supplier Gomez was distributed among a number of officers including Sergeant Johnston. In an earlier statutory declaration given in connection with the Royal Commission, Haken stated that Johnston “put a verbal admission on Gomez to cover any possible allegation of theft of money”. Haken also gave evidence at the Royal Commission of another occasion when a large amount of cash was stolen by arresting police, from which he gave $1,000.00 to Johnston. There was some corroboration of this from two other witnesses, though they did not give direct evidence concerning Johnston’s involvement. 
      
       
     11 The affidavit also included a record of interview given for the purposes of the Royal Commission by Alan Takiac, who claimed to have replaced Sweeney on the JTF, in which he referred to Sweeney as a “notorious crook”, and as having “a really bad reputation”, and also said “like basically if you had Sweeney, Best and Bourke involved in the JTF, the JTF was always going to have problems with ah integrity”.  
      
       
     12 The affidavit also referred to findings by the Royal Commission in relation to the JTF that “although it achieved a high conviction rate and not all of its members became involved in improper practices, the enquiries of this Royal Commission found that a large number of its operations were tainted by various forms of corruption”.  
      
       
     13 By leave of the Court, after the hearing of the application, the applicant also provided an affidavit from Mr. Barrow to the effect that JTF10 was unwilling to swear an affidavit; and that, in any further trial of the proceedings, the applicant would seek to call JTF10 to give evidence, and if unable to do so, would rely on s.65 of the Evidence Act.  
      
       
        
       EVIDENCE FROM CROWN 
       
     14 The Crown relied on affidavit evidence from Sweeney and Johnston.  
      
       
     15 Sweeney gave evidence that the typed record of interview in the case against the applicant accurately recorded the conversation that took place. He gave evidence that he was not called to give evidence at the Police Royal Commission, or the subject of any adverse finding or comment by the Royal Commission. He said he was still employed by the Australian Federal Police, now as a Detective Superintendent.  
      
       
     16 Johnston gave evidence that the typed record of interview accurately recorded the conversation. He denied fabricating evidence concerning Wong. He denied corruptly receiving money or fabricating evidence. He said he was not called to give evidence at the Police Royal Commission, except in the paedophile enquiry, and that he was not the subject of any adverse finding or comment by the Police Royal Commission. He said he continued with the New South Wales Police Service to 5 July 2001, when he retired having the rank of Assistant Commissioner. 
      
       
     17 There was no cross-examination on these affidavits.  
      
       
        
       ORIGINAL GROUND OF APPLICATION 
       
     18 In written submissions for the applicant by Ms. Burgess, it was submitted that, had the fresh evidence been before the jury, there was a significant possibility that the jury would have acquitted: Gallagher v. The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392, R v. Hemsley NSWCCA 8/12/95.  
      
       
     19 It was submitted that the impropriety alleged against Johnston was proximate in time and involved the fabrication of evidence against an alleged co-conspirator: cf. R v. Vastag NSWCCA 20/6/97, R v. Johns (1999) 100 ACrimR 149, R v. Beattie (1996) 40 NSWLR 155. It was sufficient that the material could be a legitimate basis for cross-examination of the relevant witness, and the fact that the witness might be unlikely to admit impropriety did not rob the material of cogency: see R v. Hasenkamp NSWCCA 24/2/98, R v. Richards NSWCCA 3/4/98. 
      
       
     20 It was submitted that the material concerning Sweeney and the findings of the Royal Commission would be a legitimate basis for cross-examination: see R v. Marsala NSWCCA 31/5/96. And it was submitted that the other evidence, apart from the evidence of the record of interview, was not such as to require conviction: R v. Baartman NSWCCA 30/6/97. 
      
       
     21 At the hearing, Mr. Berman SC for the applicant submitted that the fact that there was no evidence from JTF10 himself, and no admission by Sweeney or Johnston, did not matter. The content of JTF10’s evidence before the Royal Commission could be put before the jury, pursuant to s.65 of the Evidence Act if the applicant were unable to secure the attendance of JTF10.  
      
       
     22 For the Crown, Mr. Bellew submitted that, to show a miscarriage of justice, the fresh evidence must be material, credible and cogent. It must be such that, had it been before the jury, there would have been a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted: Gallagher v. The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392. The Court must consider all the material available: Ratten v. The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510, R v. Mickelberg WACCA 12/2/99, R v. Doney [2001] NSWCCA 463. Each case must be determined on its own merits: R v. Miller NSWCCA 3/5/96, R v. Hastings NSWCCA 29/9/97. It was also submitted that it had not been shown that JTF10 was “unavailable” within the meaning of s.65 of the Evidence Act, so that the transcript of his evidence was not admissible even in these proceedings. 
      
       
     23 In this case, Mr. Bellew submitted, the material included the unchallenged sworn evidence of Sweeney and Johnston. They made no admission at the Police Royal Commission. Neither were called or made the subject of any adverse finding or comment. Both continued in senior positions in the Police Service. Mr. Bellew submitted that it could be inferred that neither those conducting the Police Royal Commission nor the Police authorities considered that the allegations against them had any substance. The general findings of the Police Royal Commission concerning the JTF were insufficient to support an allegation of miscarriage: see Application of Moore (2000) 112 ACrimR 331.  
      
       
     24 In my opinion, the material concerning Sweeney was too vague and general to have been admissible evidence in proceedings involving the applicant. In my opinion also, the possibility of effective cross-examination of Sweeney, based on that material or upon the findings of the Police Royal Commission concerning other members of the JTF and the JTF itself, is too speculative to make this material or the proceedings of the JTF fresh evidence which could bear on the justice of the conviction. 
      
       
     25 Mr. Berman submitted that the following matters could have been put to Sweeney in cross-examination: that he served for many years with the JTF; that he accepted that the JTF had many operations in which corrupt activities took place; that he served with persons A, B, C and D; that A, B, C and D were found to be corrupt; and that he was aware of corrupt activities of the JTF and of A, B, C and D. In my opinion, the second and fourth of those questions would not be proper questions. They seek answers not concerning anything the witness has done or observed, but rather comments on statements made by other persons. I do not think that submission shows a realistic possibility of effective cross-examination based on the material.  
      
       
     26 In relation to Johnston there is specific material. If the material had been available at the applicant’s trial, Johnston could have been cross-examined concerning fabrication of evidence in relation to Wong and in relation to corrupt acceptance of $1,000.00, and the fact that JTF10 asserted the fabrication could have been put before the jury, pursuant to s.106(e) of the Evidence Act and, if necessary, s.65 of the Evidence Act. (I do not think the requirements of s.65 had to be satisfied for the purposes of these proceedings: the issue here is what evidence is now available, and out-of-court statements are relevant to that issue directly and not merely by way of hearsay.) Section 106 of the Evidence Act is in the following terms:  
      
       
        
         
         106. The credibility rule does not apply to evidence that tends to prove that a witness:  
          
         (a) is biased or has a motive for being untruthful, or  
          
         (b) has been convicted of an offence, including an offence against the law of a foreign country, or  
          
         (c) has made a prior inconsistent statement, or  
          
         (d) is, or was, unable to be aware of matters to which his or her evidence relates, or  
          
         (e) has knowingly or recklessly made a false representation while under an obligation, imposed by or under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country, to tell the truth,  
          
         if the evidence is adduced otherwise than from the witness and the witness has denied the substance of the evidence.  
         
        
       
     27 I do not think Haken’s allegation concerning $1,000.00 could have been put in evidence pursuant to s.106(e). A denial of the allegation in cross-examination is in my opinion not sufficient to satisfy that requirement. And I do not think that cross-examination concerning the $1,000.00, denied by Johnston, could affect what a jury acting reasonably would conclude.  
      
       
     28 As regards the alleged fabrication of evidence concerning Wong, the evidence of JTF10 on this matter was notably vague, and put at its highest, it suggests that, in a statement recording what are essentially denials of guilt by Wong, the words “stupid, stupid, stupid”, which might possibly be interpreted as suggesting some consciousness of guilt, were inserted. The evidence is capable of explanation in terms of a different recollection of what was said, and falls far short of suggesting fabrication of a plain admission of guilt.  
      
       
     29 When one combines these considerations with the sworn denials of Sweeney and Johnston, not challenged before this Court, the lack of any action upon the allegations taken by the Police Royal Commission or the Police authorities, the circumstance that no material reflecting on Sergeant Chapman has been produced, and the circumstance that there is no effective attack on Sweeney’s evidence, in my opinion the material does not justify a conclusion that, had the new material been available and used to best advantage before the jury, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the applicant.  
      
       
        
       ADDITIONAL GROUNDS 
       
     30 Mr. Berman SC submitted that no accomplice direction was given concerning Hitchcock. Although such a direction may not have been mandatory where an accomplice is giving evidence on his own behalf (Webb v. The Queen (1993) 181 CLR 41), the jury should have been told that Hitchcock could have a reason to implicate an innocent person, may tend to exaggerate the role of another and to fabricate evidence to achieve this, and may do so in an effective manner because of his knowledge of the circumstances: Davies v. DPP [1954] AC 378, R v. Ware (1994) 73 ACrimR 17, R v. Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301. 
      
       
     31 Next, Mr. Berman submitted that the trial judge directed the jury as follows in relation to the record of interview: 
      
       
        
         
         ... it was put to (the police officers) that they had fabricated the record of interview. That is a very substantial and serious allegation to be made, but you have to investigate it. It was put to them, in the course of the cross-examination, that they each fabricated the evidence as to taking a type record of interview and as to the questions which they say they asked Gregory and the answers which he gave. You have heard the evidence; they gave the evidence in this Court and they were cross-examined in detail. The Crown says that you accept them as witnesses of the truth and Mr McDermott put on behalf of the accused that they had fabricated and lied and therefore lied completely about the whole episode. It is a matter for you. I am merely pointing out the contest. 
         
        
        
       He submitted that this direction contained two errors: first, the suggestion that the jury should investigate the allegation of fabrication, and secondly the suggestion that the jury should determine which version was correct:  
       R v. Towner 
        (1991) 56 ACrimR 221.  
        
       
     32 Furthermore, it was submitted that the jury were given no other assistance as to how to approach this issue. They were not told that comparison of demeanour is not necessarily a sound guide to comparative veracity, that experienced judicial officers have trouble in deciding whether a practiced witness is telling the truth or not, or that belief entertained by the Police of an accused person’s guilt is a factor to be borne in mind in determining whether a confession has been made (Carr v. The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 314 at 330, 335); or that police witnesses are often practiced witnesses and it is not easy to determine whether a practiced witness is telling the truth, or that it is comparatively more easy for an accused person in police custody to have evidence available to support evidence of police evidence of confessions than it is for police evidence to be fabricated (McKinney v. The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 468 at 476). 
      
       
     33 Mr. Berman submitted that it was appropriate to extend time to enable these grounds to be relied on. The decisions of the High Court in cases such as RPS v. The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620, Wilson v. The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313 and R v. Black (1993) 179 CLR 44, all led to many successful appeals in cases where directions had been given in accordance with the law as understood prior to those decisions. Mr. Berman submitted that R v. Unger [1977] 2 NSWLR 990 was out of keeping with modern practice. Mr. Berman submitted that the prime consideration in deciding whether leave to appeal should be granted is whether a miscarriage of justice would occur in the event that the applicant was prevented from bringing the appeal: R v. Young [1999] NSWCCA 275, in which Unger was distinguished. 
      
       
     34 In relation to extension of time, Mr. Bellew submitted that none of the cases referred to by Mr. Berman involved more than a short delay; and that the proper approach was to consider whether there were exceptional circumstances that might warrant an extension of time: see R v. Sunderland (1928) 28 SR(NSW) 26 at 27, R v. Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 at 148. R v. Unger is still good law, and was applied in R v. Brehoi [1999] NSWCCA 113 and followed in R v. Knight [1998] 1 NSWLR 583. It was referred to in El Asmar v. The Queen (1992) 122 FLR 84, although the facts were distinguished, and in Ashlin v. Barrett [1988] TasR 113.  
      
       
     35 Mr. Bellew also submitted that the direction concerning the record of interview in this case was plainly distinguishable from that given in Towner: in that case, the direction given suggested that the jury should determine which of the two versions they preferred. 
      
       
     36 In my opinion, no error is shown in relation to the first additional ground. It was the Crown’s submission that Hitchcock’s evidence was unreliable; and for the trial judge to give his authority to unreliability of Hitchcock’s evidence would have been unfair to Hitchcock.  
      
       
     37 I am inclined to the view that there was an error in directions as suggested in the second additional ground, such that, if such directions were now given and the point taken at the trial, and unless the proviso were applied, a new trial would now normally be ordered in response to an appeal brought within time. However, there is a preliminary question whether an extension of time should be granted, and if so, whether r.4 leave granted. 
      
       
     38 I accept that an important consideration as to whether an extension of time for an appeal should be granted is the consideration of what justice requires in all the circumstances. However, plainly that question is not itself answered simply by the consideration that, if such a point were now taken at a trial and an appeal was now brought within time, the appeal would be allowed and a new trial ordered. As pointed out in Unger, there are many additional considerations. This is supported by three cases referred by Street CJ in Unger, namely (in the criminal field) R v. Ramsden (1972) Cr.LR 547 and (in the civil field) Re Berkeley [1945] Ch. 1 and Piening v. Wanless (1968) 117 CLR 498. In the last mentioned case, Menzies J said this (at 509-10): 
      
       
        
         
         In my opinion the verdict in the trial which was conduced upon one basis cannot be set aside merely because the decision, upon which Counsel presumably relied in determining how he would conduct his case, has been overruled subsequently. It is for Counsel to determine whether or not he will challenge or accept a decision which stands in his way, and, having accepted, his mistaken acceptance cannot be made the basis for setting aside any verdict which is returned by the jury upon the case submitted to them in order that a new, and in some ways, an inconsistent case – as the course of argument would seem to indicate – can be submitted to another jury. 
         
        
        
       Of course, those comments have to be taken in the light of the overriding consideration that justice should be done to an accused in a criminal trial, irrespective of errors by counsel. 
        
       
     39 As pointed out by Street CJ in Unger at 995, a trial having concluded and the time for appeal having gone by, the general principle is that the matter is regarded as at end, and the effect of a conviction in a criminal court, no less than a verdict and judgment in a civil court, is to merge in that conviction or judgment all of the material upon which it was propounded: Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co. Pty. Limited v. Dignan (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 106.  
      
       
     40 Street CJ went on to say this (at 995-6): 
      
       
        
         
         This concept of merger is no blind, arbitrary proposition. It is founded deeply in the fabric of the philosophy of the common law. Although in pure theory the overruling or modification by judicial decision of previous conceptions of legal principle does no more than correct a departure from the timeless perfection of the law, the plain fact is that legal principle is constantly evolving and being moulded in the light of the changing and developing social context. Recognizing this, there has always been an unwillingness to permit the re-opening of past decisions. Indeed the process of appeal, either civil or criminal, is a comparatively recent and statutory concept - it finds no basis in the common law itself. This finality of decision in each individual case leaves the courts free to permit a judicious flexibility in the development of principle in later cases, free from inhibition lest such development may set at large disputes that have previously been resolved. The concept of merger in judgment, both in the civil and in the criminal field, to which Dixon CJ referred, equally with the doctrine of res judicata, serves this requirement of flexibility for potential development of the law. 
         
        
       
     41 As I have said, an important factor in a decision as to whether an extension of time should be granted is whether the interests of justice require it; but the interests of justice must take into account not just the interests of the applicant, but also those of the Crown (and the community represented by the Crown), and of the administration of law generally. There are many factors relevant to those matters, including the powerful considerations supporting the finality of judicial decisions.  
      
       
     42 In my opinion, one factor relevant to the interests of the applicant is whether the alleged error, if established, would mean that the applicant would be entitled to an acquittal as of right, or merely that the applicant would, as a matter of course, be entitled only to a new trial. If the latter is the case, then the question is raised whether such a new trial would be fair to both sides. Another relevant factor is the degree of future harm to the applicant from a wrongful conviction. If there is still future punishment from the conviction, notably a future period of imprisonment, that would be a factor generally in favour of the applicant, particularly if the alleged error would entitle the applicant to an acquittal as of right. Another possible element of future harm to the applicant if a conviction stands might be that the applicant is deprived of compensation for a wrongful conviction and past punishment; though again, if the error would only justify a new trial and a fair trial is no longer possible, there is the countervailing consideration that to allow the appeal might open up the possibility of an unjustified claim for compensation. A further possible element of future harm to an applicant concerns the damage to the applicant’s reputation from the conviction; and the weight to be given to this consideration would vary according to the extent of the damage suggested by the material before the court dealing with the application for extension of time.  
      
       
     43 In the present case, the error in the direction concerning the record of interview would normally not justify a verdict of acquittal but at most justify a new trial. A new trial of the charge against the applicant, after a delay of twenty-one years, would be highly unsatisfactory; and it is unlikely in the extreme that such a trial would in fact take place. The applicant’s sentence has been completed, so there is no question of further punishment of the applicant. There is no suggestion in the application that the applicant wishes to pursue a case for compensation or that the applicant might have reasonable grounds to claim compensation; and in any event, in circumstances where there would not be a new trial, to admit the possibility of compensation could be unfair to the Crown and the community.  
      
       
     44 As regards the damage to the applicant’s reputation caused by the conviction, no evidence concerning such damage has been advanced. Before this conviction, the applicant had been convicted of possessing heroin, possessing Indian hemp, and conspiracy to steal. There appears to be no evidence one way or the other about any subsequent convictions, and there is no evidence as to the impact which this conviction has had on the applicant’s life after release from imprisonment. 
      
       
     45 As stated in Unger, the general principle is that, once the time for appeal has gone by, the matter is regarded as at an end. After many years have elapsed, there are powerful considerations of justice against the granting of an extension, and this should happen only in exceptional cases. In all the circumstances, I do not think a case is made out to permit an extension of time for an appeal, after the lapse of so many years.  
      
       
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     46 For those reasons, in my opinion the application for an extension of time to appeal should be dismissed.  
      
       
     47 LEVINE J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
      
       
     48 SIMPSON J: I agree with Hodgson JA.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On the second day of his trial the offender Gerard Thomas Martin pleaded guilty of the murder on 6 February 2001 at Adelaide of Kerry Jane Johnson.2 The offender and the deceased knew each other as children and began to live in a de facto relationship in March 2000. They were both addicted to alcohol. On 12 April 2000 a fight erupted between them and there was an exchange of blows. The deceased lost a tooth. No action was taken. On the following day, while the offender and the deceased were drinking together, a man approached the offender and said that he wanted to have sex with the deceased. The offender reacted by repeatedly punching the deceased in the face. The police were called and arrested the offender. The deceased was taken to hospital and treated for injuries to her mouth. On 11 May 2000 the offender pushed the deceased to the ground and kicked her in the head, then jumped on her head with both feet. She bled from the mouth and the nose. The offender was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and an apprehended domestic violence order was issued.3 The relationship between the two came to an end and the deceased took up a relationship with Mr Kevin Mackay. On 3 August 2000 the offender and the deceased were living in adjoining houses and as the deceased was walking home she had to pass the offender's residence. He came out as she did so and an argument began. He pushed her onto the roadway and punched and kicked her a number of times. She was taken to hospital and kept in intensive care. She was bleeding from the mouth and her nose was swollen. Again the offender was arrested and charged.4 As a result of the assaults of 13 April, 11 May and 3 August the offender was sentenced to serve three concurrent gaol terms of six months. Those terms expired on 4 February 2001. The offender was released from custody at 8.20am on that day.5 At the time of the fatal attack Mr Mackay and the deceased were camping together at a location near the old railway station in Broken Hill called the Pepper Trees. Other people camped there as well and alcohol was consumed. At about 7am on 5 February 2001 Mr Mackay found the deceased badly hurt. She was alive but unconscious. She was naked. Marks on the ground showed that her body had been dragged towards the place where it was found. A bloodstained rock was found near the deceased's head.6 The relationship between the deceased and Mr Mackay continued until the time of her death and the offender knew about it. The Crown tendered evidence to show that while he was serving his sentence the offender threatened to kill the deceased. It is necessary to deal with the evidence in detail because it was submitted on behalf of the offender that the evidence should be rejected as unreliable.7 Within a few hours after finding the deceased injured, Mr Mackay took part in an interview with investigating police officers. A video-tape was made of the interview and a transcript taken. The transcript sets out the following questions and answers - 
     
      
       
        
        Q34. Where were you yesterday when you last saw Kerry? 
         
        A. Pepper-tree. 
         
        Q35. Was anyone else there? 
         
        A. Rexy, Rexy Johnson, he was there with us and another fella walked up. I think he just come out of gaol. That's the bloke that nearly killed her. He told her, he told her straight to his face, ""I'm going to kill you"". 
         
        Q36. Can you tell us about that? 
         
        A. When he was in gaol out here and he found out that Kerry was livin' with me he said, ""I'm going to kill you"". When he come out of gaol he come down to pepper-trees down there an she's in hospital now. That's what he did and I was too drunk to help her. But I catch him. 
         
        Q37. And how do you know he said that to her, how do you know he said to her ""I'll kill you""? 
         
        A. I was there, when she was there. I think her sister was there too, I think, I'm not too sure. 
         
        Q38. Who's Kerry's sister? 
         
        A. What's her name, she live, gee, well, anyway, I forget her name, but I know her anyway. 
         
        Q39. And when did he say this to Kerry? 
         
        A. Last week. About a week before he come out of gaol. Q40. I'm sorry. A week -? 
         
        A. Mm. Before he come out of gaol. 
         
        Q41. When did he come out of gaol? 
         
        A. He must have come out this week some times. Yeah. 
         
        Q42. And who is he? 
         
        A. Her ex boyfriend. She finished with him, that's why he went to gaol 'cause he nearly killed her. 
         
        Q43. What's his name? 
         
        A. Mm? 
         
        Q44. What's his name? 
         
        A. Gerard Martin. 
         
        Q45. Gerard Martin? 
         
        A. Mm. 
         
        Q46. How do you know Gerard Martin? 
         
        A. She told me. 
         
        Q47. She told you, or he told you? 
         
        A. No, she did. She said, he's in gaol 'cause he, he nearly killed her, that's why he went to gaol. I think I know him, I think, yeah.” 
        
       
       
      
    8 Then Mr Mackay described a man who might have been the offender. He also gave evidence about things said by the deceased herself. There were these questions and answers - 
     
      
       
       
        
        A193. But she told me about him. She told me what he was going to do to her. I don't know how he did it, but he sent a message out from gaol that he was going to kill her. Mm.  
         
        Q194. And how did you find out about that? 
        
       
      A. She told me. 
       
      Q195. She told you?  
       
      A. Mm. 
       
      Q196. Do you know how she found out? 
       
      A. People comin' out of gaol. He give someone a message--  
       
      Q197. Right. 
       
        
        A. -- I don't know who it was, but someone had a message. He said, ""I'm going to kill Narny. 
        
       
      
    Narny was the deceased's nickname.9 At the request of counsel for the offender I looked at part of the video-tape taken on the occasion of Mr Mackay's interview and at a transcript of evidence he gave before the magistrate. It was submitted that Mr Mackay appeared during the interview to be drunk and that consequently his recollection of events was likely to be unreliable. I noticed a distinct slurring of Mr Mackay's speech, but that of itself does not indicate to me that he was affected by alcohol at the time. It is apparent from the interview that, like the offender and the deceased, he was used to drinking substantial quantities of methylated spirits. I would not expect the sober speech of such a person to be above criticism. I thought that he answered questions promptly and appropriately and obviously understood as soon as asked what the interrogator was asking. He was asked at committal whether he was affected by alcohol when interviewed and replied that the smell of metho was on him but that he was not affected. I think that that answer was true. 
     
      
    10 It was submitted that his evidence at committal fell short of what he said in his interview and that I should deal with his evidence as though he would not have given evidence at trial consistent with the account he had given in his interview. I have read the transcript of his examination and cross-examination before the magistrate. He was never asked about the offender's threat to kill the deceased. He confirmed the deceased's report that the offender would kill her. I am unable to accept the submissions. 
     
      
    11 I accept the evidence of Mr Mackay that the offender threatened in his presence to kill the deceased. I also accept his evidence that the deceased told him that she had received from the offender, directly or indirectly, threats to the same effect.12 I also accept the evidence of Mr Eric Russell that the deceased told him that the offender was going to kill her.13 I am satisfied that the offender was jealous of the deceased's relations with men and that his resentment led him to wish to do her harm. His resentment was probably made stronger because of the gaol term he had had to serve for assaulting and hurting her.14 Immediately after his release from Broken Hill Gaol the offender went to the house of the Dutton family, relatives of his, in Broken Hill. The occupants and the offender purchased alcohol and went to Menindee where they spent the rest of the day. They arrived back in Broken Hill during the evening. More alcohol was purchased and they continued drinking. During the evening the occupants noticed that the offender had left the house.  
     
      
    15 On the same day Mr Mackay, the deceased, Mr Rex Johnson, a relative of the deceased, and Douglas Hele were at the Pepper Trees camp. Mr Johnson went to sleep while it was still light and was not woken until after Mr Mackay had found the deceased injured. Mr Hele said that before he went to sleep a young man he did not know came up and asked for a drink of water, then walked away. I accept that evidence and that the man described by Mr Hele was the offender. Mr Mackay says that the offender came to the camp during the night and that he and the deceased walked off together.16 When a member of the Dutton family arose on the following morning he noticed that the offender had returned to the house and was asleep. He saw blood on his face. Photographs of the offender later taken by the police show blood on both sides of his face and on his ears. A number of people saw the offender with blood on him.17 The deceased was taken to Broken Hill Base Hospital but because her injuries were so severe she was transferred to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. She died there on 6 February 2001. A post mortem examination showed significant facial and head injuries and also swelling and bruising of the vulva and lacerations to the genitalia. Injuries included lacerations to the scalp, the bridge of the nose, the lips and the tongue. There was bruising to the scalp, eyes, mouth and shoulders. There were abrasions to the back, buttocks and arm. Seven adjoining ribs on the left side were fractured, those injuries being consistent with a heavy fall or stomping.18 The injuries to the genitalia involved marked swelling to the vulva, lacerations respectively 7.5 centimetres, 5 centimetres, 4.5 centimetres, 4 centimetres, and 2 centimetres long to the labia majora and labia minora as well as other lacerations. The forensic pathologist expressed the opinion that the state of the genitalia was more likely to have resulted from forcible blows to the vulva from a blunt object such as a fist, rock, stick or bottle. Those injuries did not exclude penile penetration before or after the infliction of the injuries. Death resulted from an acute subdural haematoma resulting from blunt head trauma.19 The offender was arrested and a tee-shirt and track pants that he was wearing were taken and examined. Blood spots were noticed and swabs taken for DNA testing. The resulting profile matched the DNA profile of the deceased. The probability of its being a chance match with the DNA of anyone else in the community was less than one in ten billion.20 Debris resembling decayed plant material was recovered from the deceased's vagina. Debris of a similar appearance was found on the offender's penis. DNA was extracted from semen found on the debris recovered from the deceased and proved on examination to be a mixture originating from at least one male and one female. Neither the deceased nor the offender could be excluded as contributors. On the assumption that the female DNA was contributed by the deceased and that only two people contributed to the mixture, it was estimated to be 350 million times more likely that the male DNA originated from the offender than from any other member of the general population.21 The offender decided not to give evidence on sentence. He gave accounts to Mr Bembrick, a social worker, whose report was received into evidence, and to Mr Jeff Wangmann, the author of the pre-sentence report. He also gave an account to Dr Stephen Allnutt, psychiatrist, whose report was received. He told Mr Bembrick that he became jealous when the deceased spoke of other men and that he would flog her. I can accept that account because it is consistent with all the other evidence. However, I cannot accept as truthful his claim to Mr Bembrick that he wanted only to hurt the deceased, not kill her. That statement was unable to be tested and was inconsistent with the threats the offender made from gaol to kill the deceased. It is significant in this respect that the offender attacked the deceased within twenty-four hours, and perhaps as little as sixteen hours, after his release.22 The offender told Mr Wangmann that he went to the Pepper Trees to drink with Mr Mackay and was surprised to see the deceased there. He said that sexual intercourse was had by consent and that at that time or shortly afterwards he became upset about alleged sexual relations between the deceased and his father and started flogging her. The offender also told Mr Bembrick that a cause of his anger was an account he had heard about a sexual relationship between his father and the deceased. He told Dr Allnutt that after spending time drinking with the Dutton family he went to the Pepper Trees to see if anyone was drinking there. He saw the deceased. He was surprised to see her. He woke her and they had consensual sexual intercourse. She told him to leave. He lost his temper and attacked her. He thought that the deceased would be all right next morning. He did not intend to kill her.23 Some parts of this account may be true but whether they are and which parts it is impossible to say. The offender knew that the deceased and Mr Mackay were in a relationship. If he expected to find Mr Mackay at the Pepper Trees he must have expected to find the deceased there as well. I think it unlikely that he was surprised to see her there. I think it unlikely in view of their history and the offender's knowledge of her relationship with Mr Mackay that he would have asked for sex. I think it unlikely for those reasons and because of the deceased's fear of him that she would consent to sexual relations.24 Mr Mackay said that the offender came to the Pepper Trees during the afternoon and that the deceased went with him to have sex. When asked how he knew, he said that he knew the deceased and had seen a flattened place where they had lain. Later in his interview there were these questions and answers - 
     
      
       
        
        Q 248. So, how, how did Kerry seem when, when he turned up at the pepper-trees? 
         
        A. I don't know, she was, I suppose, I don't know, she must have been happy 'cause she went with him. He made her go with him anyway. 
         
        Q 249. You said he made her go with him? 
         
        A. No. He could have, she could have said, I'll go with you. Yeah, she must have said, because she went with him. He might have, I don't know what he, what he did, but she went with him anyway. 
         
        Q 250. And did he force her to go with him? 
         
        A. He said, ""Come with me"". She said, ""No, I'm living with Kevin"". 
         
        Q 251. But she went with him? 
         
        A. Yeah. Yeah. 
         
        Q 252. Did she go with him of her own free will? 
         
        A. I, I don't know. 
         
        Q 253. Did he in some way force her to go with him? 
         
        A. He could have. I think he could have. 
         
        Q 254. O.K. How, how did he do that? 
         
        A. Well, he could have said, I'll punch the daylights out of you. 
         
        Q 255. Did you hear him say that? 
         
        A. He could have said that. 
         
        Q 256. But you didn't hear him say that? 
         
        A. No. But she went with him. I know for a fact that she don't like him ... I'm, I'm fearful of you, I live with Kevin. She told me he was going to kill her. That was two weeks ago. 
         
        Q 257. When, when Gerard said, ""come and have a drink (sic) with me, Narny"", what was he like? 
         
        A. He was a bit charged up. 
         
        Q 258. A bit charged up, what --? 
        
       
      A. Mm. 
       
      Q 259. -- Do you mean by that? 
       
      A. A little bit drunk. 
       
      Q 260. Did he seem happy or sad or something else? 
       
      A. He's happy to see Narny. That's why she followed him. 
       
       
      
    25 It is not clear from these statements whether Mr Mackay knew that the deceased was unwilling or whether he assumed it and whether the words he said he heard spoken were said or whether he only thought they might or must have been said.  
     
      
    26 Counsel for the offender pointed to evidence that the offender was near the Pepper Trees on the morning of 5 February 2001. It was submitted that that was consistent with a belief that he had not killed the deceased and that he had some concern for her welfare, both of which, it was submitted, spoke against an intention to kill. I am invited to conclude this from the evidence of where the offender was when he was arrested. The evidence does not suggest to me that the offender had the resources to leave Broken Hill. It seems that he was probably bound to stay in the vicinity. I do not accept the submission.27 There is no evidence of any contrition on the part of the offender for the welfare of the deceased. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, because of the offender's threats to kill the deceased, because he attacked her during the first evening or night after his release from prison and because of the savage nature of the attack that at the time of the attack the offender intended to kill the deceased.  
     
      
    28 None of the evidence shows precisely how much the offender had to drink between the time of his release and the attack. I assume that it was a substantial amount, as he was accustomed to drinking. Alcohol was part of the offender's life and his consumption of it on 4 and 5 February 2001 was neither an aggravating nor mitigating feature, except in the sense which I shall explain.29 Alcohol is not irrelevant to the Court's consideration, for it needs to be considered as part of the circumstances of cruelty, violence, deprivation and hopelessness that surrounded the offender during his formative and adult years. He is 23 years old. In view of his problematic childhood, his criminal history is surprisingly good. There are no convictions for assault other than those that I have mentioned. He has committed a handful of other offences, all comprising malicious damage to property or offensive language and all dealt with by the imposition of small fines or dismissal without conviction. They are of no significance for present purposes.30 Both the maternal and paternal sides of the offender's family have strong tribal links in far western New South Wales. He grew up in Wilcannia. His parents drank heavily. They separated when he was three years old. As a result, he did not see his father for the next fourteen years. His mother and a new partner moved to Menindee, leaving the offender in the care of his maternal grandmother. A strong bond grew up between them.31 When he was seven years old the offender was sexually abused over several months by a health worker. He was unable to tell anyone about it and still has difficulty doing so. He began to behave badly at school and his grandmother sent him to live with his mother and her partner. The offender, who loved and trusted his grandmother, was badly affected by their separation. His mother's partner and his mother drank a lot and the partner used to hit his mother and destroy things in the house. Both mother and partner fought regularly. The children were beaten with anything that came to hand; jug cord, broomstick, hose.32 The offender was expelled from school in Year 10 for swearing at a teacher and failed as a result to get his School Certificate. He has no formal qualification. He began to carry out unskilled work for the scheme by which Aboriginal people worked for the dole. As a child he had begun to drink alcohol and he remembers his mother getting him drunk on his fifteenth birthday. After that, he was drunk regularly each week. He used to draw his pay and spend most of it on drink. He also took up cannabis in his teenage years and abused it.33 The offender has been attended to by medical staff at Broken Hill Base Hospital a number of times in recent years for injuries received in fights including facial trauma in 1998, and in 1999 persistent headache, facial injuries, paranoia, acute psychosis and hallucinations, headache and hearing voices. Dr Perdices, a neuropsychologist, considers the symptoms of psychosis episodic and related to drug use. Dr Allnutt, who considers that the offender is not suffering from any psychiatric illness, has tested the offender and considers that he ranks in the low-average range of intellectual capacity.  
     
      
    34 These things combine to attract to the sentencing of the offender the considerations explained by Wood CJ at CL in R v Stanley Edward Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. At 62 and 63 his Honour said this -  
     
      
       
        
        (C) It is proper for the court to recognise that the problems of alcohol abuse and violence which to a very significant degree go hand in hand within Aboriginal communities ar4e very real ones and their cure requires more subtle remedies than the criminal law can provide by way of imprisonment. 
         
        (D) Notwithstanding the absence of any real body of evidence demonstrating that the imposition of significant terms of imprisonment provides any effective deterrent in either discouraging the abuse of alcohol by members of the aboriginal society or their resort to violence when heavily affected by it, the courts must be very careful in the pursuit of their sentencing policies to not thereby deprive Aboriginals of the protection which it is assumed punishment provides. In short, a belief cannot be allowed to go about that serious violence by drunken persons within their society are treated by the law as occurrences of little moment. 
         
        (E) While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This involves the realistic recognition by the court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects. 
         
        (F) That in sentencing persons of Aboriginal descent the court must avoid any hint of racism, paternalism or collective guilt yet must nevertheless assess realistically the objective seriousness of the crime within its local setting and by reference to the particular subjective circumstances of the offender. 
         
        (G) That in sentencing an Aborigine who has come from a deprived background or is otherwise disadvantaged by reason of social or economic factors or who has little experience of European ways, a lengthy term of imprisonment may be particularly, even unduly, harsh when served in an environment which is foreign to him and which is dominated by inmates and prison officers of European background with little understanding of his culture and society or his own personality. 
         
        (H) That in every sentencing exercise, while it is important to ensure that the punishment fits the crime and not to lose sight of the objective seriousness of the offence in the midst of what might otherwise be attractive subjective circumstances, full weight must be given to the competing public interest to rehabilitation of the offender and the avoidance of recidivism on his part. 
        
       
       
      
    35 The offender pleaded guilty on the second day of his trial after argument about the admissibility of evidence of a prior assault by him on the deceased, his service of the gaol sentence and his threats to kill the deceased. As soon as I announced my decision to allow the evidence to be adduced the offender changed his plea to guilty. In those circumstances the plea does not imply contrition. It was submitted on the offender's behalf that he is contrite. His expressions to Dr Allnutt that he was ""sorry"" and ""felt bad"" were relied on. However, the reporter who knows the offender best is the author of the pre-sentence reports dated 24 July, 4 September 2000 and 14 June 2002, Mr Wangmann. In the latest report Mr Wangmann said this - 
     
      
       
        
        In attempting to gain an indication as to the degree of remorse Mr Martin may have, he was asked to consider the reality that a life has been lost and that he is facing an uncertain future that will probably include a lengthy custodial sentence. His reply that ""there is nothing I can do about that"" doesn't indicate any significant level of contrition. 
        
       
       
      
    36 In the absence of any opportunity for the Court itself to assess the offender's attitude, I am bound, I think, to prefer the evidence of Mr Wangmann. I think that the offender pleaded guilty because the case he faced was overwhelming. I do not think that his plea was born of any desire to facilitate the administration of justice. The plea of guilty came so late that nothing was saved in the preparation of the case for hearing. It has, however, resulted in a saving of some court time and has made it unnecessary for the Crown witnesses to attend court and give evidence. I shall allow the offender a 10 per cent reduction from his sentence on that account.37 I accept the reports from the Corrective Services officers that the offender fears retribution from members of the deceased's family, some of whom are in the Corrective Services system, and that it has been considered appropriate to keep him in protection. I assume that that state of affairs will continue indefinitely and make the service of his sentence harder. I have made allowance for this in the sentence that I shall impose.38 Mr Bembrick considers that notwithstanding the offender's poor self-esteem and his feelings of insecurity and inadequacy he appears to have some insight into his past and possesses the cognitive capacity to learn new ways of learning. Speaking of programmes and developmental opportunities in gaol, Mr Wangmann notes that little has been achieved so far. However, it seems to me that the future of the offender will be very different from his past; he will not be able to get his hands readily on alcohol, there will be a great incentive for him to take a constructive approach to life, he will have the opportunity and I believe he has the capacity to learn a trade. I think that on this evidence there are prospects of rehabilitation.39 The offender has family in the Broken Hill area. His mother attended the sentence hearing. He will have the support of her and their family. It was submitted that these circumstances all combine to produce the need for a longer parole period than would otherwise be appropriate.  
     
      
    40 I have some sympathy for that submission but there are reasons why I cannot accept it. First, the non-parole period I have chosen is the least that can be imposed for such a serious offence. Secondly, such are the offender's social and psychological disadvantages that his ultimate rehabilitation may take many more years than it would be proper to incorporate into his sentence.  
     
      
    41 In fixing a sentence I have taken into account the circumstances of the deceased herself. She, like the offender, grew up in a community deprived of facilities of the type that most Australians take for granted. She suffered violence at the hands of the offender. Like him, and many of her community, she abused alcohol. Yet she was a gentle person with a sense of humour. It is important that her family and friends understand that the circumstances of herself and the offender do not lead the Court to conclude that her death is a matter of less importance.42 I was invited by counsel for the offender to specify conditions of parole but in view of the substantial non-parole period the offender will have to serve I consider it appropriate for such conditions to be determined by those who will have the supervision of him when the time arrives.43 Gerard Thomas Martin, I sentence you to imprisonment for 16 years. Your term of imprisonment will be taken to have commenced on 5 February 2001 and will expire on 4 February 2017. I fix a non-parole period of 12 years. You will be eligible for release to parole on 4 February 2013.

Seizure of the appellants’ vessel followed a series of events involving entry into, exit from, and re-entry into Australian territorial waters by that vessel. These movements were occasioned by the presence and actions of Commonwealth marine vessels in the area. Searches of the seized vessel conducted by Commonwealth officers revealed quantities of narcotics, the importation of which violated Customs Act 1901 (Cth) s 233B. A jury found the appellants guilty of the offences charged. The appellants appealed against conviction and sentence. Relevantly, it was argued that (1) the court had no jurisdiction to hear the prosecution because of the actions of the vessel; (2) pursuant to Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s 138 the trial judge should in his discretion have excluded evidence obtained through seizure and search of the appellants’ vessel because the desirability of admitting such evidence did not outweigh the undesirability of admitting the allegedly unlawfully obtained evidence; (3) in leading certain credibility evidence pursuant to Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 21E, the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions usurped Commonwealth judicial power conferred by Constitution Act 1901 (Imp) s 71; and (4) evidence as to, or tendering as an exhibit of, a written undertaking to co-operate with law enforcement authorities contravened the rule against admission of evidence relevant only to a witness’ credibility under Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s 102.Held, (The Court) dismissing the appeals against conviction,1. While a Court before whom a defendant was brought to trial might decline to exercise jurisdiction because of an abuse of process, the conduct of the Commonwealth was not an abuse of process, and the Court had jurisdiction: [12]-[18].

     2. All acts of boarding, search, arrest and seizure were lawful when they occurred. Even if they were not, the extraordinarily high probative value of such evidence, together with the other factors listed in s 38, meant that the desirability of admitting such evidence far outweighed any possible undesirability: [19]-[21].3. The power of the court to form and act on particular opinions reflected in its findings was a judicial power; the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to initiate the proceedings before the court was not. Nothing the Director of Public Prosecutions was empowered to do under Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 21E did or could result in an automatic, self-executing increase in sentence. The limit of that power was to bring the offender before a competent court to seek orders to increase sentence according to s 21E: [35].

     4. The credibility rule was not breached by the leading of evidence as to, or tendering as an exhibit of, the written undertaking. The evidence went to credibility but also to the true status of the witness as an accomplice. The ancient rule allowing evidence of status was not abrogated by the words of Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s 102. In any case, factors such as a failure to object to tendering of the undertaking weighed against a finding that there had been a miscarriage of justice: [28].

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
        
       THE COURT:  
        
        
       Introduction 
        
       
     1 On 17 October 2000 the four appellants, Messrs. Chen, Siregar, Ismunandar and Lau, were presented for trial in the District Court at Sydney before his Honour Judge Shadbolt. They were so presented upon a joint indictment charging that between about December 1997 and 14 October 1998 at Grant’s Beach, North Haven and elsewhere, they had been knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of prohibited imports to which section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, namely narcotic goods consisting of a commercial quantity of heroin being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to heroin. 
      
       
     2 All four of the appellants pleaded not guilty and they were put accordingly upon trial by jury. Each was represented at trial by counsel well experienced in the conduct of criminal trials. On 21 November 2000 the jury returned against each appellant a verdict of guilty as charged. On 16 February 2001 his Honour Judge Shadbolt sentenced each of the appellants to imprisonment for life, but fixing in the cases of the appellants Siregar and Ismunandar a non-parole period of 20 years. 
      
       
     3 Each appellant now challenges his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence passed upon him. 
      
       
     4 The relevant provisions of the Customs Act 1901 establish 1.5 kilograms as the minimum quantity of heroin constituting a commercial quantity of that drug. The quantity of heroin involved in the cases of the appellants was a gross weight of 389.9 kilograms, and a net weight of 252.3 kilograms. The heroin was imported in the form of some 1,132 compressed blocks of white powder. As of the date of trial, the amount involved in the particular importation was the largest such importation to have been detected by the relevant authorities. 
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
     5 The remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Shadbolt contain a clear and careful survey of the relevant facts. It is convenient to have regard to his Honour’s survey so as to set generally the scene for a consideration of the particular grounds of appeal that were maintained by each particular appellant. 
      
       
     6 The general background facts are stated by his Honour as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “On 13 October 1998, the Uniana, a small cargo boat, launched a speed-boat with a three-man crew just off the coast of northern New South Wales near Port Macquarie. 
         
        
        
         
         The boat reached shore. The occupants were arrested and the shore-based support group was pursued and its members taken into custody at Nabiac. Thirty-one duffel bags containing many kilos of heroin powder were stowed in the speed-boat. In the early hours of 14 October the Uniana was pursued by two Customs boats and the HMAS BENDIGO. It was arrested, boarded and searched and the remaining crew were taken into custody.  
         
        
        
         
         The amount of heroin powder when analysed was found to weigh 389 kilos and contained 252 kilos of pure heroin with an estimated street value of $620,000,000. 
         
        
        
         
         It was the conclusion of a long and doubtless expensive investigation which ranged from Hong Kong to Australia and New Zealand. 
         
        
        
         
         The Uniana was in fact a fishing trawler which has been specially converted for the heroin trade. Although its gunwales had been raised, the cargo hold so enlarged contained only the speed-boat. The ship’s only functional derrick was installed solely for the purpose of lifting the speed-boat and launching it. The remainder of the space was used to accommodate long range tanks to obviate the need for frequent re-fuelling.  
         
        
        
         
         One of those intimately concerned in the importation of the heroin, a prisoner called Chan, gave evidence of the ship’s voyage from Hong Kong to the Andaman Sea where the heroin was, after a ten day wait, loaded at night many miles from the coast. Also brought on board was a Chinese national. The voyage then continued down the Kra Isthmus through the Straits of Malacca to Singapore where, by pre-arrangement, a bunkering lighter came out to meet it and the Uniana was re-fuelled. 
         
        
        
         
         It then proceeded without again stopping, except to lower the speed-boat in order to test its engine, towards Australia, sailing south in the Java Sea, north through the Makassar Straits and then south-east along the northern coast of New Guinea until it reached Atoa where it turned south, sailing through the Coral Sea to Australia and its final destination at Port Macquarie. 
         
        
        
         
         The heroin had been stowed in a secret compartment beneath the hold which housed the speed-boat. This compartment contained a specially constructed valve which could be used to flood it in case of sudden search and so deceive any Customs officers. 
         
        
        
         
         The crew, largely Indonesian, had been recruited over a period for another small vessel, the On Shun, and on the day before they left Hong Kong the crew was transferred to the Uniana which had, a little time before, been renovated and registered in Belize. 
         
        
        
         
         Much, if not all, of the foregoing was not in dispute. The issue central to the case was that of knowledge. The prisoners had, it was conceded, been involved or concerned in the importation of heroin. None however conceded that this concern was knowing concern. 
         
        
        
         
         The case against each was, as a result, circumstantial.” 
         
        
        
       The Appeal of Chen 
        
       
     7 Five grounds of appeal were notified. All but one of them were multi-faceted. We shall deal in turn with each of the grounds; but before doing so, will return to his Honour Judge Shadbolt’s factual summary, extracting from that summary his Honour’s canvass of the Crown case against the appellant Chen on the all-important issue of knowledge. 
      
       
     8 Judge Shadbolt summarises as follows the Crown case at trial against the appellant Chen on that issue: 
      
       
        
         
         “a. He accompanied the heroin from the shore to the speed boat and on the speed boat to the Uniana. 
         
        
        
         
         b. He unpacked the heroin from the sacks and re-arranged the blocks in sports bags. This task was done at night in the hold of the Uniana where the speed boat had been replaced in its cradle. 
         
        
        
         
         c. It is a reasonable inference that he secreted the bags in the compartment below the deck of the hold.  
         
        
        
         
         d. It would have been clear from the size and the nature of the small packages that they contained heroin. 
         
        
        
         
         e. He accompanied the heroin to Australia when it left the Uniana.  
         
        
        
         
         f. He was found in possession of a Glock semi-automatic pistol and false passport.  
         
        
        
         
         g. His passport discloses a number of journeys through South-East Asia and because of the clothing he was wearing in the picture displayed in it, this document was obtained at some other time than this last journey, for that clothing was never found in his possession at Grant’s Beach.” 
         
        
       
     9 The appellant Chen gave evidence at his trial. He asserted that he was in truth an economic refugee. He said that his original intention had been to go as a refugee to Italy; but that the arrangements which had been made in that behalf were changed, Australia replacing Italy as his ultimate destination. He denied having any knowledge that the Uniana was to receive heroin. He asserted that his having accompanied the drugs was a mere coincidence. He denied any involvement in the re-packaging of the drugs. He gave as part of his version of events evidence of having journeyed through Vietnam and Burma, a part of his evidence of which Judge Shadbolt remarked that it was “riven by inconsistencies and relied heavily on strange coincidences”.  
      
       
     10 We turn to this appellant’s particular grounds of appeal.  
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “Ground 1 
           
          
         
        
        
        The Trial Judge erred in holding that the powers exercised by the Commonwealth to detain the  
       Uniana 
        pursuant to ss 59 and 185 of the  
       Customs Act 
        1901, were lawfully exercised. In consequence: 
        
        
        (a) The Court had no jurisdiction to hear the evidence relating to the detention, search and arrest of the  
       Uniana 
       .  
        
        
        (b) The evidence led by the Crown relating to the detention, search and arrest of the  
       Uniana 
        was inadmissible.” 
        
       
     11 It is necessary, for the purpose of dealing with this ground of appeal, to amplify as follows the relevant facts.  
      
       
        
       [1] The trial of the four present appellants was the third in sequence of a series of related trials of various persons connected with the events earlier herein described. The first in that sequence of trials took place, broadly speaking, in February 2000; and the second trial in the sequence took place in, broadly speaking, March 2000. 
        
        
       [2] In each of those antecedent trials, an attempt was made by counsel for the various accused in those trials to preclude the leading by the Crown of any evidence of the results achieved in the wake of the search and seizure of the  
       Uniana 
       . In the February trial, there was an application to exclude the particular evidence. In the March trial there was an application for a permanent stay of proceedings. The essential point argued was the same in each of the two cases. 
        
        
       [3] The point essentially argued can be summarised as follows: 
        
        
        (a) The  
       Uniana 
        was first called on to heave to at a time when it was within the 12 mile nautical limit of Australian territorial waters.  
        
        
        (b) That requirement made of the master of the  
       Uniana 
        was a lawful requirement, and the master of the  
       Uniana  
        did not comply with it. 
        
        
        (c) Thereafter the  
       Uniana 
        moved to a point somewhat outside the 12 mile nautical limit. 
        
        
        (d) Thereupon the pursuing Customs and Naval authorities compelled, in effect, the  
       Uniana 
        to return within the 12 mile nautical limit. 
        
        
        (e) The  
       Uniana 
        having thus returned, under improper coercion, within the nautical limit, the relevant search and seizure took place. 
        
        
       [4] In the February trial his Honour Judge Shadbolt delivered on 15 February 2000 a judgment in which he overruled the objection to the admissibility of the relevant evidence. In the March trial, his Honour delivered on 14 March 2000 a judgment in which he rejected the application for a stay of proceedings. At the trial of the present appellants it was agreed that those rulings would be taken as having been given, also, for the purposes of that current trial. 
        
        
       [5] In his Honour’s February judgment, Judge Shadbolt made the following relevant findings of fact: 
        
        
         
         “It appears clear that the ship was ordered to stop whilst it was inside the twelve nautical mile limit. It did not do so. In its flight it went beyond that limit where it was induced to change course and return within the twelve-mile limit again. Only when it was within that limit did officers of the Customs go on board exercising a power which undoubtedly then existed under s 185 of the Customs Act. That the  
         Uniana 
          may not have returned voluntarily within the twelve-mile limit is not to [the] point. The power to board and search arose as a combination of a request under s 59(1)(b) and ss 185(1) and (2), providing the vessel was within territorial waters. Arrest of persons found required the former and also the belief based on reasonable grounds of criminal activity. No intention on the part of the master of the vessel to sail within the twelve nautical mile limit was required for the operation of these sections. Were it otherwise, no vessel blown within the territorial waters by storm could have ever been boarded by Customs. The only offence created by the sections is to fail to stop without reasonable cause when requested to do so.” 
         
        
        
       [6] His Honour, in that same judgment, then noted briefly some authorities which had been drawn to his attention. It is not necessary to repeat the detail of what his Honour said in that regard. His Honour then expressed the view:  
       “that the boarding of the vessel under s 185 and the subsequent search was lawful as was the arrest of all the crew. It follows that the exercise of powers under s 188, 189, 190 and 194 of the Customs Act as it then was, were also legal.” 
        
        
       [7] His Honour then turned his attention to an alternative approach to the question of admissibility of evidence with which his Honour was then dealing. His Honour referred in that connection to section 138 of the  
       Evidence Act  
       1995 
         
       (NSW). His Honour then made the following ruling: 
        
        
         
         “The probative value of evidence obtained, both material and oral, was extraordinarily high. The arrest not only discloses where the speed boat, then on Grant’s Beach, came from, where the heroin was obtained and where it was stowed and who had management and control over it, but the falsified log sheet shows the consciousness of guilt in the accused who created it. It is therefore very important evidence. The proceedings are a trial for the importation of a massive amount of heroin. The impropriety, if that exists, of inducing the ship to return to Australian territorial waters was in all the circumstances understandable and was in all probability not deliberate. It did not in my view constitute a breach of Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but [it] would however have been impossible to obtain that evidence without the impropriety alleged. I am of the view that the Crown has persuaded me that the evidence should be admitted, it being more desirable than undesirable to do so.” 
         
        
        
       [8] In his Honour’s March judgment, Judge Shadbolt made the following findings of fact which, to some extent at least, supplement the findings expressed in his Honour’s earlier judgment of February: 
        
        
         
         “How then can the behaviour of customs officers be categorised. Certain it is that the  
         Uniana 
          was within territorial limits when it was first challenged. Equally certain is it that the request to heave-to was given after all conditions precedent had been met. The  
         Uniana 
          declined to comply. The excuse given that all three radios were turned off cannot be believed. Intelligence of other ships, their positions and intention would have been at an absolute premium. Waiting just beyond the twelve nautical mile limit placed the  
         Uniana 
          at its most vulnerable. Waiting for the return of the speedboat rendered it an object of curiosity for any passing vessel. Waiting in daylight at that position made its situation even worse. 
         
        
        
         
         … The next order given by the Commander [of the relevant Customs vessel] was probably given at the point of the  
         Uniana’s 
          departure from the twelve nautical mile limit. Thereafter, four such similar orders were given.  
         
        
        
         
         On the worst complexion the actions of the customs officers were committed in an act of hot pursuit. The more favourable view is that they were simply unaware in those heavy seas where they were in relation to territorial limits.” 
         
        
       
     12 It is convenient to turn, next, to the way in which the submissions of the appellant in support of Ground 1 were framed. The written submissions put in support of Ground 1 read, relevantly: 
      
       
        
         
         “The appellant contends that the presiding trial judge was only able to exercise jurisdiction to try matters relating to the search and detention of the  
         Uniana 
          because of the egregious and capricious act of the Crown in pursuing the vessel following its departure into international waters and forcing the vessel to return involuntarily to Australian territorial waters. The conduct of the Crown in this instance is reminiscent to an irregular extradition, such as where it is alleged that the presence of a person before the criminal court has been procured by force or other coercion. … 
         
        
        
         
         In this case, the appellant contends that the  
         Uniana 
          was forced to return to Australian territorial waters in violation of and contrary to international law. No other nation was complicit in this violation, except for Australian law enforcement agencies. The Crown should not have led the evidence regarding the search and detention of the  
         Uniana 
          and his Honour should have refused to admit such evidence on the basis that it constituted an abuse of the process of the court. …” 
         
        
       
     13 At the hearing of the appeal learned senior counsel for the appellant referred us to the decision of the House of Lords in Regina v Horseferry Road Magistrates’ Court; Ex parte Bennett [1994] 1 A.C. 42. It is not necessary for present purposes to discuss in detail the facts of that case. It suffices to refer to the following extracts from the speech of Lord Griffiths at 61H-62H: 
      
       
        
         
         “Your Lordships are now invited to extend the concept of abuse of process a stage further. In the present case there is no suggestion that the appellant cannot have a fair trial, nor could it be suggested that it would have been unfair to try him if he had been returned to this country through extradition procedures. If the court is to have the power to interfere with the prosecution in the present circumstances it must be because the judiciary accept a responsibility for the maintenance of the rule of law that embraces a willingness to oversee executive action and to refuse to countenance behaviour that threatens either basic human rights or the rule of law. …  
         
        
        
         
         [I]n the field of criminal law … if it comes to the attention of the court that there has been a serious abuse of power it should, in my view, express its disapproval by refusing to act upon it. …  
         
        
        
         
         The courts, of course, have no power to apply direct discipline to the police or the prosecuting authorities, but they can refuse to allow them to take advantage of abuse of power by regarding their behaviour as an abuse of process and thus preventing a prosecution.  
         
        
        
         
         In my view your Lordships should now declare that where process of law is available to return an accused to this country through extradition procedures our courts will refuse to try him if he has been forcibly brought within our jurisdiction in disregard of those procedures by a process to which our own police, prosecuting or other executive authorities have been a knowing party. 
         
        
        
         
         If extradition is not available very different considerations will arise on which I express no opinion.” 
         
        
       
     14 The first thing to be said about that analysis of legal principle is, in our opinion, that it gives no support whatsoever to the proposition that a Court before whom a person is improperly brought for trial has, by reason of that antecedent impropriety, no jurisdiction at all to deal with the matter thus brought before it. Such a Court, as the decision of the House of Lords now makes clear, will be entitled, for the better maintaining of the rule of law, to refuse to exercise its jurisdiction upon the basis that to do so would be to condone an abuse of the Court’s own process. This particular decision of the House of Lords, as we understand it, gives no support to the proposition advanced in paragraph (a) of Ground 1. 
      
       
     15 The decision of the House of Lords apart, we do not see any basis upon which it could properly be said that his Honour Judge Shadbolt did not have “jurisdiction to hear the evidence relating to the detention, search and arrest of the Uniana”. His Honour had jurisdiction to try criminal cases in New South Wales. The appellant was presented before his Honour in New South Wales and pursuant to the invoking by the Crown of precisely that jurisdiction. The fruits of the search and seizure of the Uniana were within the jurisdiction, and were amenable to proper control by the District Court of New South Wales. The importation which was the gravamen of the offence charged against the appellant was an importation plainly committed in part on the very coast of New South Wales, and in part within that part of Australian territorial waters lying off the coast of New South Wales. In those circumstances, we do not accept the proposition that there was any doubt about the jurisdiction of Judge Shadbolt. 
      
       
     16 We do accept that it would have been proper for his Honour to have refused to exercise that jurisdiction had proper cause in that behalf been shown to his Honour’s satisfaction. It is clear from both of the judgments given by his Honour in February and in March 2000 that his Honour did not accept that the materials put before him during, respectively, those two trials showed any good cause why his Honour should refuse to exercise his undoubted jurisdiction for the reason that to do so would involve an abuse of the process of his Honour’s Court. 
      
       
     17 The principles stated by Lord Griffiths are in any event remote from the present factual context. The facts considered by the House of Lords included a forcible removal of the defendant from South Africa to England in breach of the law of South Africa, in disregard of available extradition process and in breach of international law. The conduct of the authorities here was not in breach of the law of any other country and was not in disregard of any available extradition process. It involved bringing back into territorial waters a vessel which, assuming all other elements of the case against the appellant to be established, had brought a speedboat close to Australian territorial waters which in turn contravened Australian law in those territorial waters. It is a highly controversial and largely unargued question whether the authorities had acted in breach of international law.  
      
       
     18 It follows, in our opinion, that Ground 1(a) has plainly not been made good. That entails the need to consider the alternative that is advanced in Ground 1(b). 
      
       
     19 It is clear from what we have earlier quoted from the judgments delivered by Judge Shadbolt in the February and March trials that his Honour saw the relevant question of admissibility as hinging upon the operation of section 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). It became, thereupon, incumbent upon his Honour to exercise a judicial discretion of the kind conferred upon him by section 138. That discretion had to be exercised upon the basis of the balancing exercise required by section 138 itself: that is to say, by the prudent and sensible striking of a balance between the desirability of admitting the questioned evidence, and the undesirability of admitting the evidence having regard to the way in which it had been obtained. A decision, properly reached, that the desirability of admitting the questioned evidence out-weighed, in the circumstances of the particular case, the undesirability of admitting the evidence because of the way in which it had been obtained, rendered the questioned evidence admissible.  
      
       
     20 It seems to us to be clear beyond question that Judge Shadbolt carried out, precisely and carefully, the balancing exercise that was required of his Honour by section 138. We see no error, either of law or of fact, in the approach taken by his Honour to that matter. 
      
       
     21 Both particular limbs of Ground 1 are predicated upon a foundational proposition that Judge Shadbolt erred in holding that the detention of the Uniana had been a lawful detention. Given the findings of fact, as we have earlier noted them, made by Judge Shadbolt, we are of the opinion that this foundational proposition is not correct. It seems to us to be clear that Judge Shadbolt found as a fact that the initial demand made of the Uniana that it heave-to was made at a time when the Uniana was within Australian territorial waters. It seems to us to be equally clear that the Uniana  was within Australian territorial waters at the time it was actually boarded and searched, and at the times at which, subsequently, persons were arrested and items were seized. It seems to us to follow necessarily that the actual boarding, the actual search, the actual arrests, and the actual seizures were all lawful at the times at which, respectively, they took place. The highest point at which the appellant’s argument can be put is a contention that there was some unlawfulness or illegality or impropriety occurring between the original challenge within Australian waters and the ultimate seizure and search within those same waters. Even if it be granted that there was some such irregularity deriving from things occurring outside the strict nautical limit of Australian territorial waters, the result cannot be, in our opinion, to make unlawful the seizure and search within Australian waters of the particular vessel. All that follows from such an irregularity occurring outside the territorial limit is that the lawful seizure and search were accomplished only as a result of the antecedent irregularity. That cannot, our view, make the seizure and search itself unlawful; although, as we have earlier pointed out, we accept that on the given premise, a section 138 question as to the admissibility of the fruits of the search and seizure would arise. Further, even if the actual boarding, the actual search, the actual arrests and the actual seizures were unlawful, as the trial judge was prepared to assume contrary to his primary approach, he was right to conclude that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting it for the reasons which he gave, namely the “extraordinarily high” probative value of the evidence, the importance of the evidence, the seriousness of the offences, the understandable and non-deliberate character of the contravention and the difficulty of obtaining the evidence without the contravention alleged. Neither Chen nor any other appellant endeavoured to demonstrate that the trial judge’s approach under s 138 miscarried. There was no criticism of it because there could be no rational criticism of it.  
      
       
     22 In addition to the foregoing matters, it is necessary to consider a notice given by the appellant Chen pursuant to section 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). The notice propounds two matters which are said to arise under the Commonwealth Constitution or to involve its interpretation. At the hearing of the appeals of the four present appellants we were informed that, and satisfied ourselves that, no one of the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and of the States desired to be heard in connection with the matters thus notified by the appellant Chen. 
      
       
     23 So far as concerns Ground 1, the section 78B notice propounds this question: “whether the Commonwealth, in exercising powers conferred under ss 59, 184 and 185 of the Customs Act 1901, acted ultra vires in forcing the MV Uniana to return to Australian territorial waters on 14 October 1999 [sic: but read instead 1998]”. 
      
       
     24 It suffices to say that in our opinion the proposition thus stated, which was not argued, involves a misconception of the Commonwealth Constitution, of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), and of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). 
      
       
     25 For the whole of the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that Ground 1 has not been established. 
      
       
        
         
         Ground 2 
         
        
        
         
         “There was a miscarriage of justice by reason of the Crown calling Chan Chi Keung to give evidence on the following bases: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) The Crown led inadmissible evidence relating to the credit of Chan Chi Keung contrary to the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) The evidence was in breach of section 71 of the Constitution in so far as the Crown, by exercising powers and/or functions conferred on the Commonwealth Executive pursuant to section 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 has usurped the judicial power of the Commonwealth.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) The appellant was denied his right for his guilt to be determined exclusively by the jury contrary to section 80 of the Constitution. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) In circumstances where it failed to properly and/or adequately assess the reliability of Chan Chi Keung in calling such witness in its case against the Appellant.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     26 The ground notified in paragraph (c) was abandoned at the hearing of the appeal. 
      
       
        
       As to Paragraph (a) 
        
       
     27 The essence of the appellant’s contention is conveniently stated as follows in the appellant’s written submissions: 
      
       
        
         
         “… [T]he appellant submits that the Crown Prosecutor should not have raised as an issue or led evidence as to Chan having provided a written undertaking to co-operate with law enforcement authorities or, having done so, tendering such an undertaking as an exhibit at the trial. The effect of leading such evidence from Chan (and the tender of the undertaking) could only reinforce that witness’s credit to the detriment of the case to be made on behalf of the appellant. In leading such evidence the Crown Prosecutor was not only a [sic: in] breach of the credibility rule as expressed in s 102 of the [ 
         Evidence Act  
         1995 (NSW)], but … also [engaged in conduct constituting] a failure on the Crown prosecutor to discharge their [sic: her] functions in an impartial manner. … 
         
        
        
         
         … The appellant contends that the issue of the jury being made aware of matters which, as a matter of propriety should be taken into account in determining whether the credit of a witness is diminished, extends only to the following subject matter: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the fact that the witness is complicit in the matters which are relevant to a fact in issue; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) that such witness has pleaded guilty and is to receive a discount on sentence by giving evidence at trial of other co-accused.  
         
        
        
         
         The appellant contends that (a) and (b) above constitute the narrow approach to the disclosure of the witness’s cooperation with law enforcement authorities and does not constitute a breach of the credibility rule. However, the further disclosure that the witness has given and signed an undertaking to assist (with such undertaking subsequently being tendered as evidence) together with evidence … that the Crown can appeal against the inadequacy of his sentence if he failed to cooperate constitutes the broad approach to disclosure of the ‘true status’ of the witness and falls foul of the credibility rule. 
         
        
        
         
         The fact that the witness will be complicit will, of course, be relevant to a fact in issue in the proceedings but a plea of guilty by a co-accused cannot constitute a joinder of issue which is relevant to such fact in issue. However, the fact that a complicit party may have received a discount on the sentence that would otherwise be imposed cannot be relevant to a fact in issue and can, if it is relevant at all, (which is not conceded), only relate to the credibility of that witness.” 
         
        
       
     28 Section 102 of the Evidence Act provides simply that “[e]vidence that is relevant only to a witness’s credibility is not admissible”. The first question now to be decided is, therefore, whether the evidence led by the Crown of the witness Chan’s having undertaken in writing to cooperate with law enforcement authorities breached the rule established by section 102. In that connection we observe: 
      
       
        
       [1] The appellant’s present contention that there was such breach, seems to us to be weakened by the concession, which we understand to be carried by the written submissions previously quoted, that it did not breach the section 102 rule to lead in chief from Chan the fact that he was himself complicit in the relevant importation; and that he had pleaded guilty to the offence constituted by his complicity, receiving in that behalf a sentence discounted in consideration of his agreeing to give evidence at the trial of, relevantly, the present appellant and his co-appellants. If it does not breach the section 102 rule to disclose at least so much of the true status of such a witness as Chan, then we do not see the logic in holding that the frank and truthful disclosure of the additional circumstance that he, Chan, was prepared to protect his own interests as he saw them by giving a written undertaking, should constitute such a breach of section 102. 
        
        
       [2] There is authority of long standing in this Court for the proposition that the true status of such a witness as the witness Chan in the present case is relevant in a sense that extends beyond credibility alone:  
       Reg v Booth  
       (1982) 8 A Crim R 81; followed in  
       Reg v Gonzalez-Betes  
        [2001] NSWCCA 226.  
        
        
       [3] In  
       Booth 
        each member of the Court, (Street CJ, O’Brien CJ of Cr D and Lee J) gave concurring but separate judgments. It will suffice for present purposes to quote the following passages from the judgment of Lee J: 
        
        
         
         “The direction which practice requires a judge to give when an accomplice gives evidence for the Crown is intended to achieve a particular purpose: namely to bring to the attention of the jury that the evidence of such a witness may be in a different position from the point of view of reliability from that of other witnesses. The trial judge is expected to bring home to the jury that it is dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of such a witness; and this direction has the consequence that the witness is, in a real sense, held up as a witness whose testimony is suspect. It is left to the jury to appraise the evidence of the witness in the light of the warning given.  
         
        
        
         
         In my opinion the requirement that the judge give the direction and that the jury then assesses the witness’ evidence in the light of that warning provides the justification for the admissibility into evidence of evidence showing the position of the accomplice vis-à-vis the Crown which is the party calling him. In order for the jury to assess the degree of danger involved in evaluating his uncorroborated testimony, it is necessary for the Crown to disclose whether the witness has for instance been offered or granted a pardon, or whether it is not intended to proceed against him, or whether in fact he has been charged with an offence arising out of or related to the matter with which the accused is charged. Such evidence, in my opinion, goes to the witness’ status as an accomplice, and that is a relevant matter for the jury to consider. It is particularly relevant in regard to the extent to which the evidence of that accomplice can be called upon to found a conviction of the accused.” [8 A Crim R, 86,87] 
         
        
        
       [4] We agree, with respect, with that analysis of Lee J. We are not persuaded that those responsible for the drafting of section 102 of the  
       Evidence Act 
        intended simply to abrogate the principles thus explained. The evidence is not tendered as evidence relevant only to a witness’s credibility because it is tendered pursuant to the Crown’s duty of fairness to the accused to lay out before the jury the status of the witness without that status being dragged out in cross-examination in a manner which might not be favourable to the interests of the accused. Section 9(1) provides that the Act does not affect the operation of a principle or rule of common law in relation to evidence except in so far as the Act provides otherwise expressly or by necessary implication. Section 102 does not provide otherwise. There are other forms of evidence in chief which might, on one approach, be said to relate to credibility, while not being excluded by s 102. It is customary to obtain the address and occupation of witnesses at the start of the examination in chief. Strictly speaking the address and occupation of a particular witness at the time of the trial is irrelevant to any issue, though either an address or an occupation at the time of the events in issue can be. The evidence is received simply in order to locate the witness in society. Similarly, the qualifications of an expert do not go to an issue, and, if there is no objection to the witness’s expertise, can only be relevant to the reliability of the opinions or other evidence to which the witness testifies. Yet s 102 cannot be construed to render that kind of evidence inadmissible when for centuries it has been admissible. We reject, therefore, the proposition basal to paragraph (a), as did this Court in  
       R v Gonzales-Betes 
         
       [2001] NSWCCA 226.  
        
        
       [5] Even had we been persuaded to the contrary view, we would have held that there had been, in substance, no miscarriage of justice.  
       First 
       , it seems to us that counsel at trial for the appellant could not have been denied the opportunity of cross-examining Chan about the matters of which we have earlier spoken: see section 103 of the  
       Evidence Act 
       .  
       Secondly 
       , had the Crown not led the particular evidence from Chan, and had that evidence thereafter been elicited in cross-examination, the practical position at trial would have been, in our opinion, substantially the same as the practical position achieved in fact.  
       Thirdly 
       , had the relevant material about the witness Chan been led neither in-chief nor in cross-examination, then the jury would have been called upon to consider Chan’s reliability upon an incomplete and misleading basis. It is sometimes not possible to avoid such a result, because of some countervailing, or other, legal requirement. But such a misleading presentation of a witness such as Chan is, obviously we would have thought, to be avoided if that can possibly be done. In the present matter it could be done; and was, in our opinion, properly and correctly done.  
       Fourthly 
       , counsel appearing for Chen at the trial did not object to the tender of the written undertaking. The transcript for 18 October 2000 records that it was admitted without objection. This attracts the operation of rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, requiring leave for the moment to be taken. There is no reason whatever why leave should be given.  
        
        
        In the submissions appearing under this ground was a submission that the trial judge did not direct the jury that a plea of guilty by Chan was not evidence against the appellant, and that this failure was a material non-direction. No argument was developed in relation to this point, and it is rejected.  
       
      
      
       
        
       As to Paragraph (b) 
        
       
     29 The essential contention of the appellant is that s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) is unconstitutional as being in breach of s 71 of the Commonwealth Constitution. The written submissions of the appellant propound the following particular propositions in support of that broad ground of appeal: 
      
       
        
         
         “(a) It is predicated upon the exercise of a power that is not exclusively administrative in character, being the exercise of a power that is incidental to the Judicial power of the Commonwealth. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) Vesting of the power in the Director of Public Prosecutions is inconsistent with the separation of the Judicial power of the Commonwealth affected by Ch III of the Constitution.  
         
        
        
         
         (c) The exercise of the power has the effect of compromising the integrity of the judicial system brought into existence by Ch III of the Constitution. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) The forming of an ‘opinion’ by the Director, which has the effect following the institution of an appeal of increasing a person’s sentence, is inconsistent with the exercise of the judicial function which is constituted by the judicial act of imposing a penalty consequent upon conviction.” 
         
        
       
     30 Section 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) is, relevantly, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Where a federal sentence, or a federal non-parole period, is reduced by the court imposing the sentence or fixing the non-parole period because the offender has undertaken to co-operate with law enforcement agencies in proceedings, including confiscation proceedings, relating to any offence, the court must: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) If the sentence imposed is reduced – specify that the sentence is being reduced for that reason and state the sentence that would have been imposed but for that reduction; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) If the non-parole period is reduced – specify that the non-parole period is being reduced for that reason and state what the period would have been but for that reduction. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) Where: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) A federal sentence is imposed or a federal non-parole period is fixed; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) The sentence or non-parole period is reduced because the offender has undertaken to co-operate with law enforcement agencies as described in subsection (1); and  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) After sentence, the offender, without reasonable excuse, does not co-operate in accordance with the undertaking; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           The Director of Public Prosecutions may, at any time while the offender is under sentence, if the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the opinion that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to do so, appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence or the non-parole period. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (3) Where an appeal is begun under this section against the inadequacy of a sentence, or of a non-parole period, that was reduced because of a person’s undertaking to co-operate with law enforcement agencies, the court hearing the appeal: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) If it is satisfied that the person has failed entirely to co-operate in accordance with the undertaking – must substitute for the reduced sentence or reduced non-parole period the sentence, or non-parole period, that would have been imposed on, or fixed in respect of, the person but for that reduction; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) If it is satisfied that the person has failed in part to co-operate in accordance with the undertaking – may substitute for the reduced sentence or reduced non-parole period such a sentence, or such a non-parole period, not exceeding in length the sentence that could be imposed, or the non-parole period that could be fixed, under paragraph (a), as it thinks appropriate.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     31 Section 71 of the Commonwealth Constitution provides for the exclusive vesting of the Judicial power of the Commonwealth in the High Court of Australia “and in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction.” 
      
       
     32 In Reg v “YZ” [1999] NSW CCA 48, this Court (Beazley JA, Sully and Dunford JJ), considered the proper construction of s 21E. We agree with the following propositions, which we take from paragraphs 29 and 44 of the joint judgment of Sully and Dunford JJ: 
      
       
        
         
         “It seems to us that the purpose or object underlying s 21E is, notwithstanding the manifest deficiencies in the drafting of the section, clear. The purpose or object is that an offender who fails to co-operate in accordance with a relevant promise in that regard, is not to have his sentence of imprisonment increased unless, in fact, the failure to co-operate is ‘without reasonable excuse’. We consider that the legislative object or purpose, as thus conceptualised, is better served by a construction of s 21E that would leave in this Court a jurisdiction, a power and a duty, independent of any power or duty attaching under s 21E to the Director of Public Prosecutions, to decide whether, as a matter of fact, there has been a relevant failure to co-operate ‘without reasonable excuse’. 
         
        
        
         
         We are therefore satisfied that on the proper construction of s 21E, although the Director, to justify the institution of the appeal, must form an opinion that the non-co-operation has been without reasonable excuse, it is for the court hearing the appeal, as a pre-condition of the exercise of its powers under subs (3), to make its own determination whether the offender has reasonable excuse for not co-operating in accordance with an undertaking given by him or her. …” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     33 The joint judgment in “YZ” noted specifically that no argument had been addressed upon the question whether the determination of the question of lack of reasonable excuse under s 21E, which can have the effect of increasing the term of imprisonment to be served, constituted the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. The appellant seizes upon this portion of the joint judgment as leaving open the correctness in law of the proposition, for which the appellant now contends, that when the Director of Public Prosecutions decides, pursuant to s 21E(2): first that there has been a failure “without reasonable excuse” to co-operate in accordance with a particular undertaking; and secondly, that it is, therefore, “in the interests of the administration of justice … (to) … appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence or of the non-parole period”; then the Director, in respect of each of those two considerations, is exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth, something which the Director cannot be empowered lawfully to do because of the imperative requirements of s 71 of the Commonwealth Constitution. 
      
       
     34 The appellant bolsters that submission by referring to the following propositions, which are taken from the joint judgment of Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ in Chu Kheng Lim & Ors v The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and Anor (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 27: 
      
       
        
         
         “There are some functions which, by reason of their nature, or because of historical considerations, have become established as essentially and exclusively judicial in character. The most important of them is the adjudgment and punishment of criminal guilt under a law of the Commonwealth. That function appertains exclusively to and ‘could not be excluded from’ the judicial power of the Commonwealth. … 
         
        
        
         
         In exclusively entrusting to the courts designated by Ch. III the function of the adjudgment and punishment of criminal guilt under a law of the Commonwealth, the Constitution’s concern is with substance and not mere form.” 
         
        
       
     35 We do not accept the submissions of the appellant. In our opinion, s 21E does not entail, upon its proper construction, any attempt to vest in the Director of Public Prosecutions any power the proper understanding of which is that the power is a judicial power. Nothing that the Director of Public Prosecutions is empowered by s 21E to do results, and can result, in any automatic, self-executing increase in the particular offender’s sentence. The most that the Director of Public Prosecutions can achieve is to bring the particular offender back before a Court of competent jurisdiction, appealing to that Court for an order of that Court, that order having the effect of increasing, in accordance with the provisions of s 21E, the discounted sentence imposed at first instance upon the particular offender. It is the power of the court to form and act on particular opinions reflected in its findings which is judicial power, not the power of the Director to initiate the proceedings before the court.  
      
       
     36 The notices given by the appellant pursuant to s 78B of the Judiciary Act raise for consideration the following question: 
      
       
        
         
         “Whether there has been a breach of s 71 of the Constitution in so far as the Crown, by exercising powers and/or functions conferred on the Commonwealth Executive pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914, has usurped the judicial power of the Commonwealth.” 
         
        
       
     37 We consider, for the reasons previously given, that this question has been framed upon the basis of a misconception of the nature of the power conferred upon the Director of Public Prosecutions by s 21E. Be that as it may, the appellant’s trial did not raise any question concerning the exercise by the Director of Public Prosecutions of his power pursuant to s 21E. The witness Chan was sentenced to a term of imprisonment before he was called as a witness for the Crown at the trial of the appellant. Chan was given the benefit of a discounted sentence in return for his undertaking to give evidence for the Crown at the trial of the appellant. It is not contended, and in our opinion it could not be contended correctly, that the sentencing Judge who dealt with Chan was not lawfully empowered so to discount the sentence that would otherwise have been thought appropriate to be passed upon Chan. That is how matters stood at the moment when Chan was called to give evidence; and that is how matters stood at the moment when Chan’s evidence at trial concluded. 
      
       
        
       As to Paragraph (d) 
        
       
     38 The written submissions of the appellant say that the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         “Relies on the circumstances of this case as detailed in these submissions, coupled with the submissions made under Ground 2(a) in support of this particular ground.” 
         
        
       
     39 We have already dealt with Ground 2(a). We will deal, otherwise, with Ground 2(d) when dealing with Ground 3.  
      
       
        
         
         Ground 3 
         
        
        
         
           
         “The trial of the appellant was rendered unfair in that the Crown Prosecutor failed to act fairly in the discharge and performance of her functions: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) By calling Chan Chi Keung to give evidence in the Crown case; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) By failing to concede that a direction regarding the good character of the appellant was available given the circumstances of the case.”  
           
          
         
        
        
       As to Paragraph (a) 
        
       
     40 In our opinion, this part of Ground 3 is without substance for the reasons appearing in the following exchange which took place at the hearing of the present appeal: 
      
       
        
         
         “SULLY J: Is this correct, the Crown put Chan before the jury; it did not suppress from the defence, the accused, any of the material that it had in connection with Chan; is that a correct understanding; all his statements were disclosed?  
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]:Yes.  
         
        
        
         
         SULLY J: There is no question that anybody was taken by surprise? 
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: No. 
         
        
        
         
         SULLY J: Everybody knew who he was, what he was, what he had said, when he had said it? 
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: Yes.  
         
        
        
         
         SULLY J: Nobody impeded the proper cross-examination of Chan as a witness called in the Crown case, is that right?  
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: No. 
         
        
        
         
         SULLY J: So it became important to ensure that the trial Judge gave the jury the appropriate warnings and directions proper to such a case?  
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: Yes.  
         
        
        
         
         SULLY J: Leaving aside for the moment the complaint, if there is any, that the trial Judge did not give the proper directions appropriate to that difficult situation, what is the complaint about the Crown?  
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: The complaint is, it was the way the evidence was led and the reasons that I hope I have outlined.” 
         
        
       
     41 It appeared, thus, that no complaint was made of any alleged impropriety on the part of the Crown Prosecutor at trial. The appellant’s submissions, as they subsequently unfolded, moved away from any suggestion of impropriety on the part of the Crown Prosecutor, to a more generalised complaint which was put by learned senior counsel for the appellant in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was rather the way the approach or imprimatur of the Crown on his evidence had a substantial impact on the way the Judge gave rulings on the s. 38(1)(c) point because once the Crown’s view or presentation of his evidence became entrenched in the course of the trial, that view was picked up in the course of rulings by the Judge which allowed the Crown to cross-examine Chan, to visit upon Chan the Crown’s imprimatur which we say could have conveyed to the jury that this is the reason he has been called, this is the view the Crown has of his evidence, we have heard the Judge’s ruling on certain aspects, the Crown has been able to cross-examine him, the Crown is controlling this evidence, and it gave the Crown an unfair advantage. Even the example where the Crown was allowed to cross-examine its own witness gave the Crown a tactical advantage.” 
         
        
       
     42 We are unclear of what precisely is the complaint that this passage of submissions is intended to convey. Chan was, on any view, a problem witness. He had himself been implicated significantly in the illicit activities that were the subject of the trial. The fact that he had, so to speak, turned his coat, entailed, without more, that he was a potentially unreliable witness. In so far as the Crown pointed those matters out to the jury, we do not see that the appellant has any just cause for present complaint. Chan made a number of statements, some induced, and others not. Provided only that all of this material was available to the appellant at his trial, - and the contrary was not suggested at the hearing of the appeal, - then we do not see how the appellant was unfairly prejudiced by the calling of Chan as a witness in the Crown case. Chan was an indemnified witness, a fact which was disclosed fully and frankly to the jury at trial. It appears to be the case that certain statements made by Chan in connection with the grant of his indemnity were not tendered in evidence, although the indemnity itself was so tendered. Quite why the statements supporting the indemnity were not tendered was not explained at the hearing of the appeal. There does not appear to be any reason why counsel appearing for the appellant at trial could not have called for the statements and have ensured that they did go into evidence. All that we can say, as at present advised, is that counsel at trial did not, for whatever reason, take that course. 
      
       
     43 To suggest that there was some unfairness or impropriety in the Crown’s calling Chan at all at the trial of the appellant, is, in our opinion, a proposition which cannot be sustained. Chan was obviously, on the given facts, a witness of the greatest potential significance to the Crown case. It cannot be correct to say, simply and peremptorily, that Chan ought not to have been called as a witness at all. No objection was made at the trial to the calling of Chan as a witness.  
      
       
     44 We accept, as of course, that the Crown, having decided to call Chan as a witness in its case, was thereupon obliged to disclose in accordance with proper principle and practice the entirety of any statements made by Chan to the police, the prosecuting, or any other relevant authorities. As is clear from the passages earlier quoted, it is not contended by the appellant that this was not done.  
      
       
     45 As to the application by the Crown to cross-examine its own witness, it cannot be correct to suppose that there was anything improper or untoward in the making by the Crown of that application. Whether the application, once made, was or was not properly to be granted, was not a question for the Crown; but was, rather, a question for the exercise of a judicial discretion on the part of the trial judge. That the trial judge decided, in the exercise of that discretion, to permit the Crown to cross-examine its witness, might be indicative of error on the part of the trial judge (though no ground of appeal was propounded or contention advanced to suggest that there was any relevant error); but it cannot possibly be indicative of anything untoward on the part of the Crown in the Crown’s having sought such a ruling from the trial judge.  
      
       
     46 As to the proposition that there was something untoward in the Crown’s having invited the jury, in effect, to pick and choose among the various pieces of evidence given by Chan, we do not see anything amiss in the Crown’s having taken that approach before the jury. 
      
       
     47 In Bunning v Cross (1978) 141 CLR 54, Stephen and Aickin JJ speak, albeit in a context different from the particular context of the present appeal, of considerations respecting the obtaining of evidence in what their Honours describe as: 
      
       
        
         
         “… an age of sophisticated crime and crime detection when law enforcement increasingly depends upon electronic surveillance and eavesdropping, the unannounced search of premises or of the person and upon scientific methods, whether of identification, by finger prints or voice prints, or of ascertainment of bodily states, as by blood alcohol tests and the like.” 
         
        
       
     48 Their Honours observe that in such a context there is: 
      
       
        
         
         “… no initial presumption that the State by its law enforcement agencies, will in the use of such measures of crime detection observe some given code of good sportsmanship or of chivalry.” 
         
        
       
     49 Those latter observations are, in our opinion, equally applicable to the use, in the detection and in the proper prosecution of crime of the kind here in point, of such a witness as Chan. It would be, no doubt, preferable in an ideal world that recourse never be had to the evidence of so problematic a witness as the witness Chan in the present case. But it is not an ideal world. Large scale drug importation is a significant scourge in contemporary Australian society. Such illicit activities frequently involve, and plainly did involve in the present particular case, planning and execution of great sophistication. It will frequently be the case, whether palatable or not as a matter of abstract principle, that the opportunistic treachery of such a witness as the witness Chan in the present case will be a significant factor in the proper detection of, and in the proper prosecution of, serious drug-related crime. In any such particular case, it is, in our opinion, not only the entitlement, but the duty, of the prosecuting authorities to make every proper use of such evidence. The guiding principles are well established, and they are straight forward. They require of the Crown a full and a frank disclosure of the existence of the witness; and of all statements made by the witness, whether favourable or not to the case that the Crown proposes to pursue at trial; and the full and frank disclosure by the Crown of any other factor known to the Crown and capable of influencing the assessment by the jury of the credit of the particular witness, whether or not that assessment can be expected, reasonably, to favour the Crown case.  
      
       
     50 In our opinion, Ground 3(a) has not been made good. 
      
       
        
       As to Paragraph (b) 
        
       
     51 The relevant facts are as follows: 
      
       
        
       [1] When the appellant was arrested on 14 October 1998 he was found to be in possession of a Chinese passport in the name of Xu Chang Wen. The passport photograph was that of the appellant. The appellant, when asked by the arresting police to give them his name, gave them the name Chen Wei-Ming. He was subsequently charged, and later still brought to trial, under that name.  
        
        
       [2] The Crown called at trial an Australian Federal Police agent named Kevin Zuccato. He was cross-examined as follows by counsel then appearing for the present appellant: 
        
        
         
          
           
           “Q. I just want to ask you about the passport in the name of Zu and other names. Do you know the one I’m referring to it is Exhibit S in this trial? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Zu or Xu, sir. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Xu, I think it is. We have heard evidence, and it is undoubtedly the case, that that appears to be a photograph of the accused, Mr Chen on the passport, is that right? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. That’s right. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Just to go over very briefly a couple of things that were put to you by the Crown. Your document examiner is clear that that is a substituted photograph, is that right? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes, that’s right. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. It is not put over the top of another photograph, for instance, the original appears to be missing completely? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. This passport having been in the possession of the investigating police for sometime led you to make some inquiries did it not, of the People’s Republic of China as to the origins of this passport?  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. That’s right.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Is it your understanding that this is an authentic Chinese passport that was issued [in] this name of Xu Chang Wen? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes it is. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. But you can see there within the document the identity card number which appears in another panel?  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Your inquiries in China haven’t enabled you to be able to confirm whether that identity number corresponds with the name that appears on the passport, is that right? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. That’s right, the Chinese authorities haven’t responded to our requests.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. It is not a matter of your trying to trace the history of this passport, you’ve tried but you haven’t been able to be provided with any information from the officials in China, is that correct?  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. That’s correct, Sir. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. So far as the accused name by which he stands indicted in this trial, Mr Chen Wei Ming, that is a name that he provided to arresting police at some stage shortly after he was taken into custody on the beach, is that right? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. That’s correct. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Is it the case sir that inquiries as to that name, the origin of the person with that name identifying numbers, things of that kind, sorry things of that type, have similarly been unsuccessful so far as the police investigation was concerned?  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. That’s correct.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Because of the lack of response from China, is that the situation?  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes sir.” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         [AB 648-649] 
         
        
        
       [3] The foregoing cross-examination of Zuccato took place on Friday 3 November 2000. At the end of that day’s hearing, counsel then appearing for the appellant raised briefly with the trial judge the question whether there would be a concession by the Crown that the appellant had no criminal antecedents in Australia or overseas. It seemed to be clear at that stage of the joint trial that the Crown was disposed to concede, as to each of the appellant’s three co-accused, that he was in that sense a person of good character. Counsel then appearing for the present appellant was, obviously, concerned to avoid a situation where a good character direction was given in connection with the appellant’s three co-accused, but not in connection with the appellant. The relevant exchanges appear to have been brief and inconclusive. During their course, counsel then appearing for the present appellant said this to the trial judge: 
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             “Well, I’ve got instructions on what I’m entitled to raise, but I’ve always formed the view that one doesn’t do it until one gets confirmation from the Crown.” 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
       [4] On the following Monday, counsel then appearing for the present appellant returned to the question whether the Crown would concede as to the present appellant that nothing adverse to him was known to the relevant authorities. Counsel suggested that, instead of there being a formal concession by the Crown prior to the close of its case, that the three co-accused were, in the relevant sense, persons of good character, that matter should be postponed until, as it was hoped, some finality one way or the other could be reached in respect of the appellant himself. Counsel then appearing for the three co-accused raised no objection to that suggestion. There was a brief interchange as follows between the learned presiding Judge and counsel then appearing for the appellant Siregar: 
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             “[COUNSEL] … I have no objection your Honour just as long as its on the understanding that in effect between us the concession has been made.  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             HIS HONOUR: Yes, in fact it doesn’t require, as I understand it, a concession by the Crown. 
              
              
             [COUNSEL]: No, it doesn’t. 
              
              
             HIS HONOUR: If your client asserts that he is a person of good character, the Crown is left with nothing to contradict –  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             [COUNSEL]: On that basis I have no objection.  
              
              
             HIS HONOUR: But … [counsel then appearing for the present appellant] … is quite right, usually it is done by way of concession to cut things short.” 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
       [5] On 6 November the present appellant gave evidence in chief. He was asked, in the circumstances to which we have hitherto referred, no questions concerning character. The appellant was cross-examined in part on 6 November and in part on 7 November. The cross-examination, too, did not raise the question of character.  
        
        
       [6] On 7 November learned senior counsel for the Crown orally advised counsel then appearing for the appellant that the Crown instructions were that the holder of the identification card, the number of which had been provided to the Crown, had been identified as belonging to a named Chinese male who was not the present appellant.  
        
        
       [7] During the course of the present appellant’s cross-examination on 7 November, there occurred an exchange between the learned trial judge, the Crown Prosecutor and counsel then appearing for the appellant. That exchange drew from counsel then appearing for the appellant the following statement: 
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             “The question of whether character is going to be raised on behalf of Mr Chen hasn’t been fully ventilated yet because we were ever hopeful that the information we provided would bear fruit. If at the end of the cross-examination Agent Zuccato or someone hasn’t come through that door and confirmed in a way that I’d hope they’d confirm my instructions, I intend to seek your Honour’s leave to ask him one further evidence [sic] in chief, namely, do you have any criminal convictions and which I anticipate the answer would be in accordance with my instructions, but I have delayed doing that because we were ever hopeful the Federal Police could provide us with the material one normally seeks to protect our position.” 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
       [8] So matters continued until 13 November, the day upon which addresses commenced. Prior to the commencement of addresses, counsel then appearing for the appellant raised with the learned presiding Judge, and as follows, the continuing problem concerning the Crown’s position respecting the appellant’s character: 
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             “[COUNSEL]: … Can I just indicate that notwithstanding having spent the whole of the lunch hour in attempt to resolve this problem that we still have so far as the identification and the consequences are with my client, it hasn’t been able to be resolved to our mutual satisfaction. I am going to ask the Crown’s further indulgence not to close the door on direction at this stage, that if this could somehow [be] done at a later stage in the trial and it anyway becomes highlighted because its done in a different fashion, so be it, but at this stage all avenues have not been exhausted, especially as I’m instructed that certain steps have been taken in relation to his fingerprints, something which one would hope would remain constant so that they may resolve the matter.  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             HIS HONOUR: Well I think that it can be done at any time before I charge the jury and although I am not intending to bind the Crown I am sure that they would agree that that could be done. If its available it will be done.  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             [COUNSEL]: I just don’t want to prejudice my friend’s position because they are in a position to avail themselves of that privilege during the course of their addresses. If I had to appear to be somewhat one out at some later stage in the trial, well that’s the price I pay for it.” 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
       [9] On 13, 14 and 15 November, the various addresses of counsel were made. Prior to the commencement of the address to the jury of counsel then appearing for the present appellant, the learned presiding Judge raised the still outstanding question of character. The learned Crown Prosecutor gave a careful and precise summary of the further steps that had been taken in an attempt to resolve the inconclusive situation then current. It was clear from what the Crown Prosecutor told the Court that the best endeavours of the Crown had not been successful in obtaining the information necessary to enable the Crown to make an unqualified concession that nothing adverse to the appellant was known either in Australia or in China. Notwithstanding the then advanced stage which the trial had reached, the learned presiding Judge continued to leave open to the present appellant an opportunity of raising good character should it happen that the ongoing Crown inquiries yielded information such as to satisfy the Crown that there was no basis for contradicting a submission that the present appellant was, in the relevant sense, a person of good character. His Honour said: 
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             “If it were miraculously to happen in the next day or so [that] the negative information was received by the Crown, then I would most certainly include it in my charge to the jury. In the absence of that and in the absence of him clearly raising character, then I will not stop.” 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
         His Honour asked counsel then appearing for the present appellant whether what his Honour had said was clear; and counsel responded affirmatively.  
         
        
        
       [10] The Crown did not obtain thereafter, and prior to the conclusion of the summing-up, the information for which it had been searching, and was continuing to search. In those circumstances, the Crown would not make any formal concession to the effect that the present appellant was a person of good character. The summing-up in connection with the appellant’s case, did not contain, therefore, any direction as to character.  
        
       
     52 Against the foregoing factual background, we are of the opinion that the following simple propositions are sufficient to dispose of the ground of appeal which we are now considering:  
      
       
        
       [1] The Crown was under no obligation to concede that the appellant was a person of good character without having first satisfied itself by reasonable inquiry that such was in fact the case. In view of the doubts about the appellant’s identity, there were considerable difficulties in making inquiries.  
        
        
       [2] The Crown was under an obligation to make a full and frank disclosure to the then representatives of the appellant, of any material in, or coming into, the possession of the Crown and bearing, whether favourably or unfavourably to the appellant, on the question whether the appellant was entitled in fact to be dealt with upon the basis that he was, in the relevant legal sense, a person of good character. It has never been the appellant’s case, whether at trial or on appeal, that the Crown was in breach of this particular obligation of fairness. 
        
        
       [3] The decision either to raise, or not to raise, good character was, ultimately, a decision for the appellant himself and for those then representing him at trial. When it became plain to counsel then appearing for the appellant that the desired concession by the Crown would not be forthcoming, there was nothing, so far as we can see, that prevented counsel from then doing what he had plainly foreshadowed he would do: that is to say, to seek leave to re-examine his client so as to ask, simply, the question:  
        
        
         
          “Do you have any criminal convictions in any country?”. 
         
        
        
       [4] It seems to us to be a reasonable inference from the given facts that counsel then appearing for the appellant made a tactical decision that, if he could not have the assurance of the so-called concession that he had been seeking from the Crown, then he would not take what he saw as an unacceptable risk by asserting affirmatively the appellant’s good character. It is not for us to criticise counsel for having taken such a tactical decision; and we do not so criticise him. We make, rather, what seems to us to be the obvious point: namely, that counsel did in fact make such a decision and the appellant is fixed with the decision’s practical consequences.  
        
       
     53 In our opinion, Ground 3(b) has not been established. Nor has Ground 2(d).  
      
       
        
         
         Ground 4 
         
        
        
         
         “There was a miscarriage of justice in that the Trial Judge erred in his directions to the jury as follows:- 
         
        
        
         
         (a) By failing to give a proper and/or adequate direction regarding how the jury should approach the evidence given by Chan Chi Keung; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) By failing to give a direction in respect of the good character of the Appellant.  
         
        
        
         
         (c) By failing to give a proper and/or adequate direction to the jury about the application of the burden and standard of proof as it applied to the case of the Appellant.  
         
        
        
         
         (d) By failing to give a proper and/or adequate direction to the jury regarding the use to be made of the banking evidence led by the Crown in its case against the co-accused Lau. 
         
        
        
         
         (e) By failing to give a direction that, even if the jury preferred the evidence of the prosecution, they should not convict unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of that evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         (f) By directing the jury that, in so far as Chan Chi Keung was cross-examined about prior inconsistent statements, such cross-examination related only to the credit of that witness.” 
         
        
        
       At the outset it may be noted that counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial (who was not counsel appearing on the appeal) did not ask for directions correcting any of the errors which it is now said the trial judge made. Rule 4 applies.  
        
        
       As to Paragraph (a) 
        
       
     54 At a very early point in the summing-up, the learned trial judge gave the jury the following directions: 
      
       
        
         
         “Experience has shown that it is dangerous to convict on the evidence of an accomplice alone. Accomplices to a crime have much to gain and little to lose in giving evidence for the Crown. Fear of consequences, remorse, revenge, blame shifting and spite might provide motive enough for an accomplice to give evidence against a fellow criminal. He may have committed himself to a version of events which he cannot now change. Further encouragement might come from an offer of a shorter sentence or the ignoring of other crimes. The problem which jurors have with such evidence of people who are criminally concerned is that you never know where the true motivation might be and it may never be revealed to you. What then is a person who is criminally concerned, or an accomplice? He is in fact an accessory before the fact or a principal or an accessory after the fact. That is, he is a person who helps in the preparation of the crime or commits a crime or assists a criminal to escape liability. There seems to be absolutely no doubt that Mr Chan falls firmly into that category. It is of course a matter for you [to] determine but once you form that view, it is dangerous to convict on that evidence alone. Corroboration or evidence from outside Chan’s evidence should be considered to see if support can be obtained for the account which he has given.” 
         
        
       
     55 His Honour then drew to the attention of the jury a number of pieces of evidence which, if accepted in fact by the jury, would corroborate, to some extent, the evidence of Chan.  
      
       
     56 His Honour then gave the jury a lengthy explanation, which his Honour described as: 
      
       
        
         
         “not specifically a direction of law [but] just … suggestion to you as to how you deal with the difficult question of Chan’s evidence.” 
         
        
       
     57 His Honour drew attention to the various statements that had been made by Chan to the investigating authorities. His Honour explained that the jury could take account, in making its assessment of Chan’s reliability, of his demeanour; of any lies which the jury was satisfied Chan had told; and of any inconsistencies found as a fact by the jury among the various statements made by Chan. His Honour then concluded this portion of his summing-up in this way: 
      
       
        
         
         “What you would be doing in that case is to say as you inspect his evidence, I would accept that of him because it is confirmed by other pieces of evidence. I would not accept that because it either offends my sense of how things actually work in the real world or in the alternative, because there is no corroboration for that particular piece of evidence. When you do that, you can separate out as it were, those matters of Chan’s evidence that you would accept and to those which you would reject. I just wanted you to move away from any thought that you would just choose one account or the other or neither on some impressionistic feel. I think you can analyse what he has said to you and accept parts and reject other parts or of course you can, if you wish, reject the whole lot of it.” 
         
        
       
     58 In our opinion, Chan was plainly an accomplice. Though s 164(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 abolished the universal common law duty to give an accomplice warning, the power and the duty to do so in appropriate circumstances survives: see also s 165(5). It became, therefore, incumbent upon the learned presiding Judge to give the jury a clear direction to the effect that it would be dangerous to convict the appellant, and his other co-accused, upon the uncorroborated evidence of that accomplice. This, as it seems to us, his Honour plainly and correctly did. It became, then, further incumbent upon his Honour to give the jury some assistance in understanding the nature of corroborative evidence; and in identifying those matters of fact which, if accepted by the jury as having been proved, could constitute such corroboration in the appellant’s particular case. This, also, we think his Honour plainly and correctly did.  
      
       
     59 It would have accorded with normal practice for his Honour to have instructed the jury that, although it was dangerous to convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of Chan, the jury might nonetheless do so if, having scrutinised his evidence with particular care, and in the light of the warning as to the said danger of conviction, the jury was prepared to accept the evidence and to act upon it. In the present case, those additional matters were not put to the jury; but it cannot reasonably be supposed, in our opinion, that such omission entailed disadvantage to the appellant such as to result in a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
     60 The submissions put for the appellant criticise the passages which we have extracted from the summing-up, upon the basis that they failed to put, either adequately or at all,  
      
       
        
         
         “Any ‘countervailing arguments’ as to why a witness may feel compelled to adhere to a falsehood and feel a need to continue with it.” 
         
        
       
     61 In our opinion, a fair reading of the entirety of the passages which we have earlier quoted from the summing-up does not support this proposition. We are strengthened in that view by the fact that the appellant was represented at trial by counsel well experienced in the conduct of criminal cases, and no application was made for a re-direction according with the submission now put for the appellant.  
      
       
        
       As to Paragraph (b) 
        
       
     62 We need add nothing further to what we have earlier herein written upon this topic.  
      
       
        
       As to Paragraphs (c) and (e) 
        
       
     63 These two aspects of Ground 4 are linked in the written submissions of the appellant, and it is, therefore, convenient to consider them together.  
      
       
     64 At a very early point during the course of the summing-up the learned trial judge instructed the jury, correctly, that the real issue for the jury was the issue of knowledge on the part of the appellant and each of his co-accused that the enterprise in which, in one way or another, they were all implicated was an enterprise involving the importation into Australia of prohibited drugs. His Honour told the jurors that they must bear in mind: 
      
       
        
         
         “… Of course, that it is the knowledge in each accused which must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown. Not what you would have known, not what I would have known, not what a reasonable man or woman would have known, but the actual knowledge of these accused. Each of them.” 
         
        
       
     65 His Honour went on to explain to the jury that proof of knowledge in the relevant legal sense might be accomplished in any of a number of ways, of which one was the proper drawing of an inference of knowledge from relevant circumstances. His Honour gave the jury, in clear and simple language, a number of practical illustrations of the types of circumstance which might be thought relevant in the particular case. His Honour then gave the jury the following direction: 
      
       
        
         
         “Circumstantial evidence is evidence as other evidence as is receivable in these courts and is regularly received in these courts. You must have regard for the fact that finger prints are circumstantial evidence. But in order for that evidence to be accepted beyond reasonable doubt, it must point to the guilt of the accused and be capable of bearing no other rational hypothesis.” 
         
        
       
     66 His Honour then gave the jury a practical example of a situation involving a number of possible explanations, each of which could be analysed and rejected until there remained only one ultimate credible explanation. His Honour rounded out that discussion as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “You cut off all the alternatives and what you are left with, of that you can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. It is not necessary to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of all the matters advanced by the Crown but you must be satisfied of course beyond reasonable doubt to conclude that the circumstances indicate guilt and are capable of bearing no other rational inference.” 
         
        
       
     67 His Honour then gave the jury what might be described as a thumb nail sketch of, on the one hand the Crown case against each of the then accused, and on the other hand, the case presented by each such accused in answer to the Crown case against him. His Honour then gave the jury an extensive summary of the evidence that had been adduced at the hearing. His Honour next summarised the arguments put by the Crown and, variously, by the then representatives of the appellant and his co-accused. 
      
       
     68 His Honour, when summarising the Crown submissions in the case against the present appellant, said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “As far as Chen is concerned, the Crown says – let’s put aside what Chen says for a moment, what have you got which is sustained by all the evidence in the case? That Chen was on a fishing boat with fourteen sacks of drugs. He got off that fishing boat into a speedboat with fourteen sacks of drugs. It came back to the  
         Uniana 
         . It was said by Chan that he undertook the re-packaging of it. It then arrives off the coast of Australia and he is in the speedboat. He is in the speedboat which brings it into Australia and he is arrested and in his bag is not only his false passport but a 9 millimetre semi-automatic pistol which only needed cocking to fire. That, the Crown says, is a very strong case of knowledge.  
         
        
        
         
         Has Chen raised a reasonable doubt? His evidence, the Crown says, is a concoction and a fantasy. He travels to Italy without luggage and without documents or money or jobs. He came from a large Westernised city. He did not ask for a passport in China not because he would not have got one but because he already had one, a passport which shows that he has travelled around south east Asia and also into Hong Kong. The passport photos, which were his, were there to obtain the necessary visas. He was not a fare paying passenger but a drug smuggler.  
         
        
        
         
         The Crown says that when you look to the cross-examination of him, you will dismiss his account of events and remain with the very strong case of knowingly concerned.” 
         
        
       
     69 The rhetorical question “Has Chen raised a reasonable doubt?” obviously caused the learned presiding Judge, upon reflection, some anxiety. His Honour indicated in the absence of the jury that he was, as his Honour put it, “a little concerned at the way … (his Honour had left that question) … to the jury.” His Honour discussed the matter with the Crown Prosecutor who made this submission: 
      
       
        
         
         “I must confess though I am a little concerned at the way I went to the jury and I think my friend … (counsel then appearing for the present appellant) … is correct when I say – and I was in error I concede – when I said accepting all that the question is a reasonable doubt raised by what Mr Chen said. The question is, is there a reasonable doubt on all the evidence, not Mr Chen having to raise it.  
         
        
        
         
         That is so, having said that I would submit it oughtn’t to be a submission now made particular to Mr Chen but a general submission so as to include all accused. Because I think if I am not mistaken – I certainly highlighted it in Mr Chen’s case and I may well have put it a little broadly in respect of other accused.  
         
        
        
         
         I’d ask that your Honour direct the jury that ultimately they look at all the evidence and acquit if they (are) left with a reasonable doubt as to guilt.” 
         
        
       
     70 His Honour indicated that he would give such a direction and in due course his Honour did so in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, I have brought you back because I undertook to say something to you before lunch, and I omitted to do it, and so I have to bring you back.  
         
        
        
         
         It arises in Mr Chen’s case but it is applicable to all the cases. That is, that you must look to all of the evidence to see if the Crown has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt of its case on knowing concern. 
         
        
        
         
         You just do not look at the accuseds’ evidence but you must look to all of the evidence before you come to a conclusion in that regard.” 
         
        
       
     71 To the foregoing survey of the relevant portions of the summing-up, it is necessary to add but one further passage which occurred at the very end of the summing-up, when his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, if at the end of your deliberations you are of the view that all or any of those alternative hypotheses have not been demolished by the Crown then of course it would follow that you must acquit. But equally so, if you (are) satisfied beyond doubt that these four men or any of them or all of them were knowingly concerned in the sense that I have explained to you, then it will be your duty to convict.” 
         
        
       
     72 It should be noted, also and lest there be any doubt about the matter, that his Honour gave at the inception of the summing-up the customary direction as to the onus and standard of proof. 
      
       
     73 The appellant puts, in the foregoing context, two submissions.  
      
       
     74 The first submission focuses on the passage which we have quoted in paragraph 70 above. The purport of the submission is, perhaps, best summarised in the following except from paragraph 4.3.4 of the written submissions of the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         “… (N)otwithstanding the general direction that was given to remedy an error, the jury was still left to determine the matter on the basis that it would be  
         equally open 
          on the available evidence to be satisfied that the Crown had proved its case to the requisite standard in the event that the jury rejected the case for each of the co-accused. When this ground of appeal is considered is conjunction with Ground 4(e), the appellant contends that there has been a failure to fully explain the burden of proof such that the jury would have been labouring under the misconception that the Crown stood on an equal footing with the appellant and the issue was which of the competing cases (that of the Crown or of the appellant) was to be preferred. In giving the ‘general direction’ his Honour failed to direct the jury that it was still incumbent on the Crown to prove its case to the requisite standard.” 
         
        
       
     75 We will deal separately, and a little later herein, with Ground 4(e). Setting aside for the moment that aspect of the present discussion, we are of the opinion that Ground 4(c) has not been established. The appellant’s submission picks up, and focuses upon, the words “equally so” in the relevant passage from the summing-up. A fair reading of the passage in the context of the summing-up as a whole seems to us to indicate that his Honour was doing no more, in the particular passage of which present complaint is made, than to reiterate to the jury his Honour’s earlier directions about the proof of an issue by means of circumstantial evidence. His Honour was re-emphasising to the jury the need for the jury to have regard not only to the rational hypothesis of guilt which the Crown sought to have drawn from the circumstantial evidence; but also to the alternative hypotheses consistent with innocence which had been propounded, variously, by the present appellant and by his co-accused. His Honour was reiterating to the jury that the Crown, as part of its over-all burden of proof, had to “demolish” each of those suggested alternative hypotheses consistent with innocence, before the Crown could have accepted by the jury the Crown’s own proposed rational hypothesis of guilt. 
      
       
     76 The second submission of the appellant is particular to Ground 4(e), although it rests factually in part upon the passage which we have quoted in paragraph 70. The appellant’s submission marries, so to speak, that particular paragraph with the additional directions that we have quoted above in paragraph 69. It is submitted that those directions were inadequate in that they did not direct the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “… (that the jury)… should not convict unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the  
         truth 
          of Chan’s evidence …” 
         
        
       
     77 The submission is said to be supported by the decision of the High Court of Australia in Liberato v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 507. The submission relies in particular upon a passage appearing in the dissenting judgment of Brennan J at 159 CLR at 515. The passage reads: 
      
       
        
         
         “When a case turns on a conflict between the evidence of a prosecution witness and the evidence of a defence witness, it is commonplace for a judge to invite a jury to consider the question: Who is to be believed? But it is essential to ensure, by suitable direction, that the answer to that question (which the jury would doubtless ask themselves in any event) if adverse to the defence, is not taken as concluding the issue whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt the issues which it bears the onus of proving. The jury should be told that, even if they prefer the evidence for the prosecution, they should not convict unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of that evidence. The jury must be told that, even if they do not positively believe the evidence for the defence, they cannot find an issue against the accused contrary to that evidence if that evidence gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to that issue.” 
         
        
       
     78 The foregoing propositions have been recently considered by the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Western Australia: Salmon v The Queen [2001] WASCA 270 (30 August 2001). McKechnie J, who delivered the principal judgment of the Court, and with whom the other members of the Court, (Malcolm CJ and Kennedy J), agreed on the Liberato point, said, concerning what has come to be described as “the Liberato direction”: 
      
       
        
         
         “99. It is a counsel of prudence to give a  
         Liberato 
           
         direction in most, if not all, cases. It is a sensible direction which further emphasises the standard and the burden of proof.  
         
        
        
         
         100. The absence of a  
         Liberato 
          direction in an appropriate case will make the drawing of a conclusion that there has been a miscarriage of justice easier.  
         
        
        
         
         101. Nevertheless, if in  
         Miles  
         at par 49, Miller J was intending to lay down a principle that a  
         Liberato 
           
         direction is required as a matter of law, then with great respect, I am unable to agree. I prefer the reasoning of Murray J. 
         
        
        
         
         102. The absence of a  
         Liberato 
          direction may give rise to a miscarriage of justice. In each of  
         Latham 
          and  
         Middleton  
         the absence of a  
         Liberato  
         direction, coupled with positive directions given by the trial Judge in each case, meant that the Judge’s summing-up, overall, constituted a misdirection.  
         
        
        
         
         103. I would not elevate a  
         Liberato  
         direction to the status of a principle of law, the absence of which will inevitably lead to a conclusion that the learned trial Judge has erred in law.” 
         
        
       
     79 We respectfully agree with his Honour’s analysis.  
      
       
     80 In the appellant’s case, it was necessary that the summing-up should explain clearly to the jury the following propositions: 
      
       
        
       [1] That the Crown case against the appellant could not succeed unless the Crown proved to the satisfaction of the jury and beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had at all material times the requisite knowledge. 
        
        
       [2] That the Crown case against the appellant on that issue was a circumstantial evidence case. 
        
        
       [3] That such a circumstantial evidence case could not succeed unless the Crown satisfied the jury beyond reasonable doubt, that the hypothesis of guilt, which the Crown was asking the jury to infer from the circumstantial evidence placed before them by the Crown, was the only rational hypothesis available on that evidence.  
        
        
       [4] That, in so far as there had been propounded for the consideration of the jury alternative hypotheses consistent with innocence, it was part of the burden of proof resting on the Crown to refute each and every one of those alternative hypotheses.  
        
        
       [5] That the backbone of the Crown case was the evidence of Chan. It was accomplice evidence. It was, therefore, dangerous to convict upon it in the absence of corroboration.  
        
        
       [6] That, notwithstanding that danger, the jury might nonetheless convict upon the evidence of Chan, although uncorroborated, provided that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it could safely accept as truthful, and therefore reliable, the whole, or any relevant part or parts, of Chan’s evidence.  
        
       
     81 It can be acknowledged at once that the learned trial judge did not put the foregoing propositions in so many words to the jury. It must be borne in mind, however, that the question now to be decided is not whether the words in fact used by his Honour could, or could not, or might, or might not, have been put in a form better placed to withstand the scrutiny of hindsight. Neither is the relevant question whether, with that same hindsight, it can be said fairly that it would have been prudent to have given, generally to the effect of the form suggested by Brennan J, some additional directions. The relevant question is, rather, whether upon a fair reading of the entirety of the summing-up the foregoing propositions were put, in substance, to the jury. As we have earlier herein pointed out, the proposition at [6] was not put to the jury at all; but for the reasons earlier given we are of the opinion that there was no miscarriage of justice on that score. That matter apart, we are satisfied that the entirety of the summing-up, read fairly, did sufficiently bring to the attention of the jury the substance of the remaining propositions as we have stated them. We are strengthened in that conclusion by the fact that the appellant’s counsel at trial, who was, as we have earlier noted, well experienced in the conduct of criminal trials, did not see any need to ask for any further direction of the kind now suggested; and certainly did not bring to the attention of the trial judge the dissenting judgment of Brennan J, or, indeed, any other relevant feature of the decision in Liberato.  
      
       
     82 For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that Ground 4(c) and Ground 4(e), whether considered separately or in conjunction, have not been established.  
      
       
        
       As to Paragraph (d) 
        
       
     83 Part of the Crown case against the present appellant’s co-offender Lau consisted of evidence of various banking transactions with which it was alleged that Lau could be connected relevantly. It is not necessary to canvass the detail of that part of the Crown case against Lau. It suffices to quote the following excerpt from a judgment delivered by the learned presiding Judge on 18 October 2000, that judgment overruling an objection taken by counsel then appearing for Lau to the admission of the banking evidence. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown contends that Lau’s banking accounts spring to life as it were, 8 months before the enterprise when millions of Hong Kong dollars came in and equally were withdrawn in cash, usually within hours of deposit, and then to return to accounts showing modest amounts being deposited and being withdrawn, are one of several circumstances, which combine with others, shows Lau’s involvement in this enterprise.” 
         
        
       
     84 It is clear from a reading of the relevant portions of the trial transcript that the Crown sought to lead this banking evidence only as part of its case against Lau; and not as part of its case against any of the other three of Lau’s co-accused at trial. The present appellant now submits that this limited intended use by the Crown of the banking material was not made plain by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury.  
      
       
     85 The appellant submits, and we accept, that it is trite law that in a trial of two or more accused it is part of the duty of the trial judge to ensure that the jury at trial considers the individual case of each individual accused separately from the individual case or cases of the other individual co-accused. We accept, also, that it is part of that duty of the trial judge in such a case to ensure that when the jury comes to consider the case of a particular co-accused, the jury considers that case upon the basis of, and only of, the evidence properly admitted in connection with the case of that particular co-accused.  
      
       
     86 Quite how that duty is to be discharged cannot be reduced to the form of a simple and all-encompassing formula that is to be applied slavishly in any and in every joint trial. In the case of a joint trial as to which it is contended that the trial judge did not sufficiently assist the jury in the separate consideration of the individual cases of the particular co-accused, it is necessary to have careful regard to the entirety of the relevant summing-up. The focus is not to see whether the summing-up, if microscopically examined, can be made to yield a useful forensic debating point. The focus, rather, must be upon the practical questions: first whether what has in fact been said by the trial judge in the particular case, can be regarded reasonably as having made clear to the jury: the need for the jury to consider separately the individual case of each of the particular co-accused; and secondly, whether the particular summing-up has in fact sufficiently isolated for the assistance of the jury the content of any evidence relevant only to the individual case of the particular co-accused. 
      
       
     87 The summing-up at the trial of the present appellant and of his then co-accused occupies, excluding applications for re-directions, 103 pages in volume 5 of the 6 volumes that constitute the appeal book. At pages 5 and 6 of that summing-up, his Honour is recorded as having given the following directions to the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “As you have been made aware by counsel there are in fact four trials going on within this courtroom at the same time and each accused is entitled to your separate consideration. Because one may be guilty it does not mean to say that the other three are guilty. Equally, if one is not guilty is does not mean that the other three are not guilty. You must look at each case separately and determine each case and return a verdict in respect of each case, that is, four verdicts. 
         
        
        
         
         There is certain evidence in this case which is particular to one of the accused. The forged log for instance is evidence against Ismunandar only. The engineer’s log is evidence against Siregar only. You have to separate those two pieces of evidence when you come to consider what evidence [there] is against each of them.” 
         
        
       
     88 The first extended directions by his Honour concerning the banking material are recorded at pages 25-27 of the summing-up transcript. His Honour’s first words, as thus recorded, were: 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, I said I was going to move straight onto the defence case but I return to the case of Lau and to the banking documents.” 
         
        
       
     89 His Honour then drew the attention of the jury to various aspects of the Crown case against Lau, in so far as that case had to do with the banking evidence. His Honour then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown case in respect of Lau, the Crown says that the banking records showing massive withdrawals to cash, visits to Cambodia when banking activity accelerated, being on the voyage without any nautical function and his only job described by Chan was that of telephonist/interpreter, going out to get the heroin and bringing it back to the  
         Uniana 
         , when he had no sea experience and being arrested on the boat and having a passport on the beach in Australia. When you look at all of those circumstances together the Crown says that the only conclusion that you can come to was that he was knowingly concerned.” 
         
        
       
     90 Much later in the summing-up his Honour returned to a canvass of the Crown case against each of the four then co-accused. Each such case is canvassed distinctly and separately. It is only in connection with that canvass of the Crown case against Lau that any analysis is made of the evidence concerning the banking transactions. His Honour concludes that canvass of the Crown case against Lau by saying: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown says that that 18.4 million dollars is one of the factors which you can consider. The Crown says that this shows massive withdrawals to cash and visits to Cambodia when banking activity accelerated. He is next found on the voyage without function. His only job was as a telephonist and interpreter. He goes out to get the heroin and he brings it back and he is arrested on the boat which has just recently had it on board.  
         
        
        
         
         The Crown says when you put all of that together there is a very strong, indeed irresistible circumstantial case of knowledge in Lau.” 
         
        
       
     91 Still later in the summing-up, his Honour canvassed similarly the individual cases that had been put on behalf of the four then co-accused. It is only in connection with that canvass of the case put forward on behalf of Lau that his Honour says anything further about the evidence of the relevant banking transactions.  
      
       
     92 We are of the opinion that a fair reading of the entirety of the summing-up shows that it was structured in such a way as kept distinct and separate at all times, what was being said in connection both with the four individual Crown cases and in connection with the four countervailing defence cases. We are not persuaded that a fair reading of the entirety of the summing-up gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that the jury impermissibly used in the case of the present appellant the banking evidence, which the Crown had adduced in connection with the case of Lau alone.  
      
       
     93 We are strengthened in this view by the fact that, as we have earlier herein pointed out, the present appellant was represented at trial by counsel well experienced in the conduct of criminal trials; and no application was made for a re-direction according with the complaint made in the present ground of appeal.  
      
       
     94 We are, therefore, of the opinion that Ground 4(d) has not been made good. 
      
       
        
       As to Paragraph (f) 
        
       
     95 The learned trial judge began his Honour’s summing-up with what might be called conventional directions as to their respective functions, of his Honour and of the jury. His Honour, explaining to the jury that they were the sole judges of the facts, told the jury that it was for them to assess the witnesses whom they had seen and heard; that it was open to the jury to accept the whole or part only of what any witness had given in evidence; that in so assessing any particular witness the jury should keep in mind certain factors which his Honour then outlined; and that the jury, in drawing inferences from facts admitted or proved, needed to be careful to proceed in a rational rather than in an instinctive way. It was immediately following those directions that his Honour gave the following direction, of which the present appellant complains: 
      
       
        
         
         “There has been cross-examination on credit, that is, cross-examination on matters which are not central to the case but the aim of which is to show the witness in such a light that you might think less of his evidence and place less credence in it. This has been done by putting to a witness prior inconsistent statements that have been made on a previous occasion to demonstrate that the witness cannot be relied upon. They are not issues central to the case, they lie just outside that and are used simply to, if successful, to indicate to you that you should not put any credence in that witness’s evidence.” 
         
        
       
     96 It is submitted that this direction given by his Honour was erroneous in that it was based upon a misunderstanding of the purpose of cross-examination on a prior inconsistent statement in a case to which the provisions of sections 102 and 103 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) are applicable. It is submitted that what his Honour told the jury does not accord with the law as established by the recent decision of the High Court of Australia: Adam v The Queen (2001) 183 ALR 625.  
      
       
     97 The following propositions can be drawn from the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Adam: 
      
       
        
       [1] Evidence that Chan had given prior inconsistent statements, (as he plainly had done), was relevant to his credibility.  
        
        
       [2] The evidence of what he had said in those prior inconsistent statements did not relate only to his credibility, but was relevant also to other issues arising in the trial of the appellant. 
        
        
       [3] Because of this fact, that is to say, because evidence of the prior inconsistent statements was relevant to more than the bare issue of Chan’s own credibility, the credibility rule in s 102 was not engaged.  
        
        
       [4] It was, therefore, unnecessary to consider the operation of the exception, provided by s 103, to the credibility rule established by s 102. 
        
        
       [5] The evidence of the prior inconsistent statements, because it extended to facts in issue beyond the bare fact of Chan’s own credibility, was within the exception provided by s 60 of the  
       Evidence Act 
        to the hearsay rule, and was admissible as evidence of the truth of the contents of the prior inconsistent statements.  
        
       
     98 It is undoubtedly the case that the learned trial judge did not direct the jury in the precise terms of the propositions that we have summarised above. It becomes, therefore, necessary once again to look carefully, not at what his Honour did not do, but at what his Honour did. We have previously herein drawn attention to various things said by his Honour to the jury in connection with the way in which the jury should approach the evidence given by Chan, bearing in mind that there were, as his Honour told the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “big discrepancies within the evidence itself”. 
         
        
        
       We need not repeat that material.  
        
       
     99 His Honour, as recorded at pages 9 and following of the summing-up, specifically drew the attention of the jury to conflicting accounts given by Chan of his relations with Lau. His Honour explained to the jury in careful detail a range of matters which it would be open to the jury to take into account in connection with their assessment of Chan’s evidence. His Honour told the jury, in terms, that it was entirely a matter for the jury whether the jury accepted a particular version given by Chan, rejecting contrary versions given by him; or whether the jury rejected all of the versions given by Chan. We think that a fair reading of the entirety of the relevant portions of the summing-up justifies a conclusion that his Honour made it clear to the jury that, in so far as Chan had given inconsistent versions of relevant facts, it was open to the jury to accept as truthful in fact any part or parts of any one of those inconsistent statements. No doubt trial judges, guided by the decision in Adam, will give in future summings-up, directions about prior inconsistent statements in a form according more particularly with the substance of the propositions of law that we have extracted from the joint judgment in Adam. We are satisfied, however, that the essence of what was put to the jury in the present case sufficiently left to the jury the substance of those propositions.  
      
       
     100 We are, therefore, unpersuaded that Ground 4(f) has been established.  
      
       
        
         
         Ground 5 
         
        
        
         
         “Generally, there has been a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     101 It is to convenient to begin by quoting the brief written submission of the appellant in connection with this ground: 
      
       
        
         
         “Even if this Court finds that each ground of appeal has failed individually, the appellant submits that the combination or aggregation of the defects identified in the various grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant constitute a miscarriage of justice warranting appellate intervention. Despite the strength of the Crown case, the appellant did not have, as he was entitled to have, a fair and proper trial.” 
         
        
       
     102 For the reasons previously herein given, we have concluded that, indeed, “each ground of appeal has failed individually”. We do not see any remaining basis upon which to found properly a finding that the appellant was denied “a fair and proper trial”.  
      
       
        
       Summary 
        
       
     103 For the whole of the foregoing reasons we have come to the conclusion that the appeal against the present appellant’s conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       The Appeal of Lau 
        
       
     104 Judge Shadbolt, in his Honour’s remarks on sentence, summarised as follows the case against the appellant Lau on the issue of knowledge: 
      
       
        
         
         “(a) … Lau recruited the witness Chan by offering him a job when he was unemployed.  
         
        
        
         
         (b) He arranged for Chan to go to Australia to choose a beach suitable to land a speedboat. He also arranged for him to go to China to meet the boss Fei Lo Nam and required him to take his papers.  
         
        
        
         
         (c) When Chan returned from the [reconnaissance] mission to choose a beach in Australia he went with Lau to Cambodia. It is a reasonable conclusion from the evidence that a man called Poon accompanied them on at least part of that journey. There is evidence that Poon, to all intents and purposes, owned the Uniana. It was he who renamed it, re-registered it, and personally arranged and paid for refuelling it by going to Singapore to meet representatives of the fuel vendors.  
         
        
        
         
         (d) Lau [boarded] the Uniana, according to Chan, as an interpreter, although it became clear under cross-examination that no interpreter was required as Chan spoke English as did Mandagi, the captain.  
         
        
        
         
         (e) He went in a speedboat with Chan to receive the heroin from the delivery vessel in the Andaman Sea. He was not a sailor. He had no experience of small speedboats and appeared to fulfil no function other than to receive the heroin. 
         
        
        
         
         (f) He answered the telephone calls from mainland China, ostensibly from a man named Fei Lo Nam, and conveyed instructions contained in those calls to Chan. The use of the telephone continued after the Uniana had reached a position off the coast at Port Macquarie and the speedboat had been launched. 
         
        
        
         
         (g) Through Lau’s accounts passed $18,400,000 HK approximately, much of it by way of cash deposits which were quickly credited and withdrawn. Activity in this account always accelerated around the time that Lau made one of his many trips to Cambodia. This activity subsided when funds were totally withdrawn only days before the Uniana sailed.” 
         
        
       
     105 Lau, alone of the four co-accused at trial, did not give evidence at trial. He was represented by Senior Counsel well experienced in the conduct of criminal trials. The defence at trial consisted, in significant part, of a strong attack upon the reliability of the witness Chan. The issues thereby raised are summarised sufficiently for present purposes in the following two further passages taken from the remarks on sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Most of the Crown’s evidence in respect of Lau’s specific involvement came from the witness Chan and the Crown led from him a record of interview which he had given police at Port Macquarie before he knew that Lau had been arrested. When he strayed from this document he was cross-examined and attested in accordance with the statements which he had given police.  
         
        
        
         
         He was cross-examined by [senior counsel] and from another statement which he had made the following year and an exculpatory account emerged in which Chan had recruited Lau. Lau was employed as an interpreter and telephonist. He knew nothing about the heroin and when it emerged that that was what they had brought on board, he disassociated himself from the enterprise. Yet the jury convicted. This could only have occurred if the jury had rejected this second account and accepted the Crown’s submission that Chan had been telling the truth to police in the first instance. This coupled with the financial evidence, the general evidence of the vessel, its modification and its route to Australia, was sufficient, it appears, to convince the jury beyond reasonable doubt of Lau’s guilt.” 
         
        
       
     106 The present appellant, and his co-appellant Chen, were represented in this Court by different solicitors but by the same counsel. The grounds of appeal of each of those two appellants are not identical, but there is a substantial overlap between the two sets of grounds of appeal. This fact makes it possible to deal more briefly with the present appellant’s appeal than with the appeal of Chen. We shall deal with the present appellant’s grounds of appeal in the order in which the grounds were notified.  
      
       
        
       Ground 1, Ground 2 and Ground 3(a) 
        
       
     107 These grounds correspond to Grounds 1, 2 and 3(a) in the appeal of Chen. What we have earlier said in connection with these grounds when considering the appeal of Chen applies in the case of the present appellant.  
      
       
        
         
         Ground 3(b) 
         
        
        
         
         “The trial of the appellant was rendered unfair in that the Crown Prosecutor failed to act fairly in the discharge and performance of her functions by failing to put the allegation to Chan Chi Keung that he shared the same cell as the appellant and as a consequence tailored his evidence to support the Appellant’s case.” 
         
        
       
     108 Shortly after the witness Chan was arrested he gave a statement to the police. Speaking broadly, but sufficiently for present purposes, that statement inculpated the present appellant.  
      
       
     109 At the time of his giving that statement to the police, Chan did not know that the present appellant, too, had been arrested and was in custody.  
      
       
     110 Shortly thereafter, the present appellant and the witness Chan were removed to the same place of detention and were housed for a period in the same cell.  
      
       
     111 Sometime thereafter the witness Chan made an induced statement to the investigating police. Speaking broadly, but sufficiently for present purposes, that statement exculpated the present appellant.  
      
       
     112 It was the Crown case that Chan had told the truth in his first statement. The Crown obtained leave to cross-examine Chan; and established by that cross-examination that Chan, when first interviewed by the police, did not know the whereabouts of the present appellant; that Chan had not provided to the police the name of the Uniana notwithstanding that he had been travelling on it for some weeks; and that the present appellant was a friend of Chan’s.  
      
       
     113 The Crown did not cross-examine Chan so as to suggest to him that it had been only after he had found out that Lau had been arrested, and had spent some time sharing a cell with Lau, that Chan had made the subsequent statement exculpating Lau. The Crown, having sought and obtained leave to cross-examine Chan as an unfavourable witness, indicated to the trial judge that it was intended to cross-examine Chan about whether he had made a prior inconsistent statement, that is to say his original statement to the arresting police; and so to establish that Chan had in fact made a prior inconsistent statement. The Crown Prosecutor said in terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “I don’t propose to ask him why he said it or why he has changed his mind or anything of that kind. I am going to limit myself to that exposure of inconsistency.” 
         
        
       
     114 Chan was extensively cross-examined, of course, not only by the Crown Prosecutor, but by counsel appearing for the four co-accused. Senior Counsel then appearing for the present appellant cross-examined extensively, and so as to establish the detail of the induced statement made by Chan in which he, Chan, effectively exculpated the present appellant. The Crown Prosecutor did not re-examine so as to suggest to Chan that the reason why he had made that inconsistent induced statement was that, having discovered that his friend Lau had been arrested, he, Chan, had decided to change what he had previously said about Lau and so give what help he could to his friend.  
      
       
     115 Sometime later during the trial, the Crown sought to lead evidence of the relevant Corrective Services records establishing the fact that Chan and the present appellant had shared a cell at a time between the making of Chan’s original statement to the arresting police and the making of his subsequent induced statement. Senior Counsel then appearing for the present appellant objected strenuously to such a course being allowed. The learned trial judge ruled that the evidence would be admitted because, in his Honour’s view the Crown was entitled to lead evidence which would establish, if accepted, that there had been a reasonable opportunity for the present appellant and Chan in effect to put their heads together. His Honour said that he regarded such evidence as admissible evidence “in the sense of a shield rather than a sword”. This expression seems to us to be a reference to the fact that the cross-examination of Chan by the present appellant’s then Senior Counsel had made completely clear that the appellant’s case was that Chan had told lies in his original statement; that Chan ought to be accepted in so far as he admitted having done so; and that Chan should be accepted, also, as having been truthful in the version given by him in his subsequent and induced statement. We understand his Honour to have been expressing the view that the Crown was entitled to meet that case by showing that in fact Chan and the present appellant were friends who had shared a cell after their respective arrests; and that those circumstances might well support the drawing of a reasonable inference that, in truth, it was the original statement that was reliable, and the subsequent and induced statement that was unreliable.  
      
       
     116 It is submitted that the Crown Prosecutor acted unfairly in not putting to Chan the proposition that, in the circumstances above referred to, he had tailored his later and induced statement so as to favour the present appellant. This unfairness, it is submitted, led to a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
     117 As to the suggested unfairness, it needs to be remembered that Chan was never put forward by the Crown as, simply and unreservedly, a witness of truth. Had the Crown asked the question which it is now submitted that the Crown ought to have asked, it is more probable than not that Chan would have responded in the negative; and that the Crown would have gone to the jury upon the basis that that answer was another piece of Chan’s evidence which ought to be rejected as untruthful. Had that happened, we do not see either how the Crown case would have been significantly weakened, or how the appellant’s case would have been significantly strengthened. Even were it to be held that there had been some unfairness in the omission to put the suggested question, we would not accept that the present appellant lost on that account the fair chance of an acquittal.  
      
       
        
         
         Ground 4 
         
        
        
         
         “The trial judge failed to apply the proper test in determining to admit the banking evidence relating to the appellant as circumstantial evidence proving knowledge of the appellant.” 
         
        
       
     118 We have previously referred to aspects of the banking evidence with which the present ground of appeal is concerned. The appellant contends, in connection with the present ground of appeal, that the learned trial judge admitted the evidence upon a basis that was wrong in law. The appellant points to the following passage in the ruling pursuant to which the evidence was admitted:  
      
       
        
         
         “The presentation of the circumstantial case to prove knowledge must, if it is to go forward to the jury, reach a prima facie level, which merely means that it is one which if not answered by an accused could properly found a conviction. This is not to reverse the onus of proof, this is merely to require if there is not to be a conviction that the accused demonstrates an alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence and so provides reasonable doubt. Often enough the Crown’s case carries with it elements of the alternative hypothesis and the Crown would submit that the jury accept on a proper basis some elements and reject on equally properly basis others. Sometimes, it remains with an accused entirely, should he wish to raise an alternative hypothesis, consistent with innocence.” 
         
        
       
     119 It is submitted for the appellant, and omitting references to authorities cited, that: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is not for the appellant to demonstrate that he has an alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence, but the obligation is imposed on the Crown to exclude such a hypothesis. It is a corollary of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the jury must acquit if there is a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence.” 
         
        
       
     120 It seems to us that the challenged passage is not fundamental to the reasoning upon which his Honour’s ruling actually rests.  
      
       
     121 The question for his Honour was, simply, whether the banking evidence, which the Crown wished to lead, was relevant in the sense contemplated by s 55(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW): that is to say, whether it was evidence that “if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue”. 
      
       
     122 His Honour dealt with that question as follows, in a passage immediately preceding the passage which we have earlier quoted: 
      
       
        
         
         “There appears to me to be no doubt that money to this order coming from unexplained sources through clandestine but not illegal channels into accounts and from those accounts to others where it is withdrawn in cash to be expended on what and where no-one knows, is a set of circumstances which may not of itself point to heroin purchases. It could equally point to arms dealing or any number of such activities which lie at the margins of criminality, but coupled with the journey on the ship, for no ostensible (or believable) reason, to a place in the Bay of Andaman where a speedboat was launched and to assist in the bringing back on board the  
         Uniana 
          one third of a ton of heroin powder and to travel with that heroin to New South Wales where it was to be off loaded and taken to shore may together indicate knowledge.” 
         
        
       
     123 Later and at the conclusion of his ruling, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is my view that the evidence of the banking arrangements and the accounts which Lau maintained is evidence which, with other evidence, could, on the face of it, prove knowledge and in consequence it is relevant and it is admissible and I would not exercise my discretion to exclude it.” 
         
        
       
     124 We are clearly of the opinion that the evidence was relevant and therefore admissible. It is not now submitted that the evidence, if relevant and therefore admissible, ought nevertheless to have been excluded in the exercise of some relevant discretion.  
      
       
     125 In those circumstances, we are of the opinion that this ground of appeal has not been established.  
      
       
        
         
         Ground 5 
         
        
        
         
         “The trial Judge erred in failing to grant a separate trial of the Appellant given the evidence as adduced at trial.” 
         
        
       
     126 This ground of appeal was not pressed.  
      
       
        
       Ground 6(a) and (c) 
        
       
     127 These two grounds of appeal correspond to Grounds 4(a) and (e) in the appeal of Chen. What we have earlier written in connection with Chen’s Grounds 4(a) and (e) applies to the present appellant’s Grounds 6(a) and (c). 
      
       
        
         
         Ground 6(b) 
         
        
        
         
         “There was a miscarriage of justice in that the trial Judge erred in his directions to the jury … (b) By failing to give a proper and/or adequate direction to the jury regarding the use to be made of the banking evidence led by the Crown.” 
         
        
       
     128 It is convenient to begin by quoting the relevant portions of the written submissions of the appellant. Page references to the summing-up have been omitted.  
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour gave a direction to the jury regarding the nature of circumstantial evidence and he twice directed the jury on the banking evidence in relation to the Crown’s case against the appellant. His Honour did not seek to balance the directions that he gave regarding circumstantial evidence (including the banking evidence) with a direction that the jury must acquit the appellant in the event that there was a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence. Such an inference was clearly open when one had regard to his Honour’s finding that the banking activity was otherwise legal in nature.” 
         
        
       
     129 In our opinion this submission does not fairly reflect what in fact the learned trial judge said in the relevant parts of his Honour’s summing-up. It is the case that his Honour gave early in the course of the summing-up, and in terms to which we have previously herein referred, a clear and correct direction concerning circumstantial evidence and concerning the proof of a Crown case by circumstantial evidence. It is true, too, that his Honour twice summed-up to the jury the Crown case in connection with the banking evidence. It is, however, the case that his Honour summed-up, correspondingly, twice to the jury the case which had been put by the present appellant in connection with the Crown’s banking evidence. Upon the second of those occasions, his Honour introduced the particular section of the summing-up by saying: 
      
       
        
         
         “The cases for the accused have this feature in common, that each of them advances a hypothesis consistent with innocence.” 
         
        
       
     130 We point out, yet again, that the correct approach for present purposes is one that reads fairly the entirety of the summing-up. Approached in that way, we are wholly unpersuaded that his Honour’s relevant directions were unbalanced. We reject the present ground of appeal.  
      
       
        
       Ground 6(d) 
        
       
     131 This corresponds with Chen’s Ground 4(f), and fails for the same reasons.  
      
       
        
       Ground 7 
        
        
         
         “Generally there has been a miscarriage of justice”. 
         
        
       
     132 This ground corresponds to Ground 5 in the appeal of Chen. What we have written in relation to that Ground 5, applies also to the present appellant’s Ground 7.  
      
       
        
       Summary  
        
       
     133 For the whole of the foregoing reasons we have come to the conclusion that the appeal against the present appellant’s conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
         
        
       Ismunandar and Siregar: the background 
        
       
     134 In order to understand the arguments advanced on behalf of Ismunandar and Siregar to this Court, it is useful to consider the background affecting them. 
      
       
        
       The arrival on the Uniana 
        
       
     135 Ismunandar, an Indonesian, was the chief officer of the Uniana, and was arrested on board that vessel at about 7.30 am on 14 October 1998, together with other members of the crew. Siregar, also an Indonesian, was the chief engineer. He had earlier travelled ashore on the speedboat which landed at Grant’s Beach, and was arrested on landing at about 3.30 am. The captain of the Uniana, another Indonesian, was named Mandagi.  
      
       
     136 In May 1998 Poon, a Hong Kong national, made arrangements for a vessel called the Ming Star to be renamed the Uniana. A certificate of registration for Belize was issued on 27 May 1998. From 25 May 1998 Siregar served as chief engineer, having been recruited in Singapore by a person called Frankie.  
      
       
     137 Mandagi, Ismunandar and the other members of the crew of the Uniana arrested on 14 October 1998 (apart from Siregar) in the four or five weeks before 10 August 1998 had been onboard a vessel called the On Shan at anchor outside the port limits of Hong Kong. Ismunandar said he had been recruited to work on the On Shan by Frankie while in Singapore in mid 1998. He and Mandagi had documents containing Frankie’s telephone number; Frankie was an associate of Poon’s; Frankie had also recruited Siregar to work on the Uniana. Ismunandar had spent four or five weeks painting and chipping rust. In mid July 1998 Chan visited the vessel. On 14 August 1998 Ismunandar said that two Chinese men came onboard the On Shan, one of whom was Chan. Mandagi then informed the crew in the presence of the two Chinese men that the On Shan had been sold, their jobs were at an end, but that jobs were available on another vessel which turned out to be the Uniana. All but one of the crew accepted the offer. He was the chief engineer. The Uniana did not need a chief engineer, since Siregar had been acting as its chief engineer since May.  
      
       
     138 On the same day, all the existing crew of the Uniana except Siregar left that vessel. They were at once replaced by those coming from the On Shan.  
      
       
        
       The structure of the Uniana 
        
       
     139 The Uniana had been designed as a well deck fishing vessel by Japanese shipwrights. It was 32 metres long and had a gross tonnage of 246 tonnes. To the casual observer it looked like a typical dilapidated Japanese or Korean fishing boat. It continued to present that appearance up to the time of its arrival in Australian waters on 12 October 1998. But it had undergone significant modification into a small cargo vessel, though one which could carry very little cargo. It could carry very little cargo because 8 metres of the cargo hold was taken up by a speedboat, the remaining 6 metres of cargo space was divided by a bulkhead, and no attempt had been made to utilise the corridors running port and starboard exterior to the cargo hold area for cargo. The deck had been raised to accommodate the speedboat on a fixed cradle in the specially constructed hold. There were spaces beneath the deck originally used for fish storage which were converted into fuel and water tanks. A curious feature of the arrangements was that there was a small boat on deck aft, which made the speedboat, taking up storage space, superfluous. Siregar admitted that in his experience it was very unusual for a speedboat to be housed in the cargo hold within a vessel carrying any cargo. He also thought it strange to have a speedboat in the cargo hold instead of on deck, and was quite surprised about it. He raised it with Mandagi but got no explanation. Another feature of the Uniana was that it had a derrick capable of being used to raise the speedboat from its cradle under the deck and launch it over the side into the sea. In bad weather two to three men would be needed on each side of the speedboat to steady it, one or two men would be needed to man the port and starboard slew ropes, one man would be needed to operate the winches, and one man, probably the first officer, would be needed to supervise the operations. If the speedboat were lifted aboard again with an additional 400 kilos, more hands would be needed. And if the speedboat, with the extra 400 kilos, were relaunched into the sea in poor conditions at night, it would be desirable to have as many hands on deck as possible. Since there were only 11 crew members when the Uniana approached Australia, the probabilities of both Siregar and Ismunandar being involved in the operations of lowering and raising the speedboat to be described below is high.  
      
       
     140 The Uniana had three large fuel tanks and a fresh water tank under deck. A chamber between the water tank and one of the fuel tanks was constructed as a void space with a valve capable of flooding the chamber with sea water: that valve had been installed recently. It is difficult to see that that chamber had any legitimate or conventional nautical purpose. There was evidence that the drugs imported were in fact stored there.  
      
       
     141 While the Uniana was moored outside Hong Kong in the period before 14 August, Siregar observed Chan and two welders come on board the Uniana in order to extend the boom arm on the derrick so as to enable the speedboat to be taken onboard. He answered questions from Chan about the welding operation.  
      
       
     142 On about 10 August 1998 the speedboat was loaded into the Uniana.  
      
       
     143 In short, the Uniana, while maintaining its dilapidated exterior, had been modified into a vessel with adequate fuel and water capacity to travel long distances without cargo, and with a speedboat capable of picking up and dropping drugs. Its engines and steering gear were in good order. A new crane had been installed to raise and lower the speedboat, and having apparently only that purpose. The Uniana had been converted into a smuggling vessel.  
      
       
        
       The voyage of the Uniana to the Andaman Sea 
        
       
     144 On 15 August 1998 Chan and Lau, nationals of Hong Kong, boarded the Uniana. On the same day the Uniana left Hong Kong at 5 pm. Apart from Chan and Lau, there were 11 crew members onboard. Ismunandar was the officer in charge of the 4 pm–8 pm watch. He did not fill in the log because it had already been filled in. He queried this with Mandagi, who gave no explanation. At the end of the shift Mandagi said the vessel was going to the Andaman Sea to collect some people. According to Ismunandar, about three days after the vessel left Hong Kong he saw the speedboat in the cargo hold after the canvas cover and hatch covers had been removed. At about the same time, according to Ismunandar, Mandagi said the vessel was going to the Andaman Sea to pick up an important person with his belongings and other important things to be taken to Australia. According to Siregar, Mandagi said they were going to pick up people. 
      
       
     145 About 5 September 1998 the Uniana reached international waters off the coast of Burma and Thailand in the Andaman Sea. She there began to wait. Ismunandar admitted that on Mandagi’s instructions he falsified the ship’s log to avoid recording the voyage from Hong Kong to the Andaman Sea, which was “highly irregular”. Further, the only engineer’s log found in the Uniana began on 22 September 1998 after the vessel had left Singapore for Australian waters: as chief engineer, Siregar was responsible for any falsification of the ship’s documents by failure to keep an engineer’s log.  
      
       
     146 While the Uniana waited, Lau and Chan engaged in telephone calls by satellite telephone. 
      
       
     147 After the Uniana had waited about 10 days, the speedboat was lowered onto the high seas one night, lit only by torchlight, and driven by Chan, with Lau onboard, to another vessel. Rice sacks containing heroin were placed onboard and Chen also boarded it. The speedboat returned to the Uniana and was raised onboard. Both Ismunandar and Siregar participated in the lowering and raising of the speedboat. Ismunandar saw both Chen and the rice sacks. He said he thought Chen was the important person to be smuggled into Australia and that the sacks were his personal belongings. Siregar said he saw the sacks but not Chen.  
      
       
     148 The heroin in the rice sacks was repacked below deck. The speedboat engine had been damaged in the course of taking onboard the rice sacks. Siregar denied that Chan was attempting to work out what was wrong with it, that he looked down through one of the open hatches to see what Chan was doing, and that he saw Chan repacking the heroin. Ismunandar accepted that as chief officer it was his responsibility to ensure the safe stowage of cargo in order to prevent it moving about while the Uniana was at sea. He said he did not do this. He denied that the reason he did not do this was because he knew others would repack it. He said he thought the bags were the personal possessions of Chen, the man being smuggled. He denied knowing of any repacking during his 4 am–8 am watch, denied seeing any light from the hatch covers despite the fact that it was dark until 7am, and denied that the heroin was stowed in the void chamber below the cargo hold. 
      
       
        
       From the Andaman Sea to Singapore and Australia 
        
       
     149 The Uniana then went to Singapore to be bunkered outside port limits from 15 September 1998 pursuant to arrangements made by Poon and Frankie. Frankie came onboard. One hundred tonnes of marine gas oil were ordered, but only 65.8 tonnes were actually loaded. Five drums of lubricating oil were loaded. Poon paid for the supplies. The refuelling receipt was signed by Siregar: he could not explain why it showed, falsely, that the next port to which the Uniana was travelling was Japan.  
      
       
     150 The Uniana in fact sailed to Australia and came near Port Macquarie on 12 October 1998. The speedboat was launched in the evening of 12 October 1998, but the journey could not continue because of bad weather. It was launched again at 9.45 pm on the evening of 13 October 1998. Mandagi instructed Siregar to board the speedboat. On arrival Chen, Chan and Siregar carried bags ashore before they were arrested.  
      
       
        
       The Crown case against Ismunandar as accepted by the jury 
        
       
     151 The trial judge summarised the Crown case against Ismunandar thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “a) That Ismunandar was recruited by drug smugglers for this enterprise. 
         
        
        
         
         b) He was the Chief Officer, or Mate, of the ship. 
         
        
        
         
         c) He had been waiting for six weeks for the Uniana to sail. 
         
        
        
         
         d) He played his part in falsifying the log so that it would show a route from Hong Kong harbour, where it had never been, to Manila harbour, where it was never to go, and thence to New Zealand. 
         
        
        
         
         e) His duties, that of overseeing the cargo, if any, the checking of the equipment and the inspection of the water tank were apparently ignored.  
         
        
        
         
         f) He was responsible in part for the course which the ship actually took as shown on the charts. 
         
        
        
         
         g) He played his part on deck, launching and retrieving the speedboat.” 
         
        
       
     152 The trial judge summarised Ismunandar’s defence thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “He gave evidence in which he maintained that he had no idea that the ship was carrying heroin. What he had been told was that they were to sail to the Andaman Sea and there pick up a rich Chinese with his belongings. He had not seen the speedboat when he came on board because he had been told by the captain that there was no cargo. 
         
        
        
         
         He had not checked equipment because he had been told that it was unnecessary and he had failed to fill in the log on each of the two watches a day that he had stood because he had been so directed by the captain. He had participated in falsifying the log at the captain’s direction.” 
         
        
        
       As the trial judge said, the jury must have rejected the evidence in which Ismunandar propounded that case. 
        
        
       The Crown case against Siregar as accepted by the jury 
        
       
     153 The trial judge summarised the Crown case against Siregar thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “a) He was in charge of repairs on the Uniana in preparation for a long sea voyage. 
         
        
        
         
         b) He was present when the derrick was lengthened. 
         
        
        
         
         c) He claimed no knowledge of the destination of the ship or the duration of the voyage which would have made it impossible for him to ascertain the amount of fuel required. 
         
        
        
         
         d) There was no engine room log until one was commenced on 14 September, the approximate date when the actual course of the Uniana intersected the falsified course from Hong Kong. 
         
        
        
         
         e) His denial that he did not know of the secret compartment was impossible to reconcile with his position as chief engineer on a small ship when this compartment lay between fuel tanks and water tanks.  
         
        
        
         
         f) He signed a false receipt for the fuel taken on at sea, south of Singapore. 
         
        
        
         
         g) He is seen as one of the three figures on Grant’s Beach each of whom was pulling bags from the surf and taking them up the beach.  
         
        
        
         
         h) He was the engineer responsible for the maintenance of the speedboat engine, its repair at sea in the Andaman, the testing on two occasions off Sulawesi, and he accompanied the heroin in the speedboat to Grant’s Beach.” 
         
        
       
     154 The trial judge summarised the defence case as advanced in evidence by Siregar thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “He gave evidence in which he said that he knew nothing of heroin and the Golden Triangle and was merely carrying out the instructions of his captain and did not even know the destination of the vessel. Under cross examination it was clear that he did know where the ship was going. He had no explanation for his signing of the false receipts for fuel or his possession of one of the Prada bags identical to those used for the repacking of the heroin. Further, his denial of being in the hold the night the heroin was repacked was in sharp conflict with Chan’s evidence that he was down there attending to the motor boat.” 
         
        
       
     155 Again, as the trial judge said, the jury must have rejected the evidence through which Siregar’s defence was advanced.  
      
       
        
       Ismunandar Grounds 1 and 2 and Siregar Grounds 1 and 2: Separate trials and limits on cross-examination 
        
        
       The grounds of appeal 
        
       
     156 Ismunandar relied on the grounds in a document entitled “Grounds of Appeal”, and also on a document entitled “Amended Grounds of Appeal”.  
      
       
     157 Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Grounds of Appeal were: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. His Honour erred in failing to grant the appellant a separate trial. 
         
        
        
         
         2. (a) His Honour erred in restricting cross- 
          
           
            
             
             examination of the accomplice Chan in respect to 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) Chan’s role in the operation to import the heroin particularly in relation to the co-accused Khong Hoi Lau; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (ii) Chan’s pending appeal against the severity of his sentence; and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (iii) Chan’s reluctance and/or alleged inability to give evidence against those arrested on the beach awaiting the arrival of the heroin.  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) His Honour erred in rejecting the tender of the passport photo Chan had in his possession upon landing at the beach.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     158 It is convenient to take these grounds with Grounds 1 and 2 relied on by Siregar in his Further Amended Grounds of Appeal which are: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The Trial Judge erred in limiting the cross examination by the defence of the witness Chan Chi Keung (‘Chan’) concerning his dealings with the Chinese organisation. 
         
        
        
         
         2. His Honour erred in rejecting the tender of Chan’s passport.” 
         
        
        
       Procedural background 
        
       
     159 The procedural background is as follows. 
      
       
     160 On 17 October 2000, before the accused were called on to plead, the counsel then appearing for Ismunandar made an application for a separate trial on the basis that the evidence against his client was significantly weaker than that against the other three accused. After discussing the background facts and the authorities, the trial judge rejected the application. Ismunandar argued on appeal that the trial judge misapplied the relevant principles, mainly so far as the trial judge had found that there was no “risk that the case against the others would make the case against him stronger and improperly so”.  
      
       
     161 Counsel for Ismunandar on the appeal contended that the cases against Chen and Lau were much stronger than the case against his client. He said the prejudice of which he complained did not flow from the admission against his client of otherwise inadmissible evidence, but from the trial judge’s restriction of the cross-examination of Chan conducted on his behalf. 
      
       
     162 Pausing at this point, in our opinion the contention that a separate trial should have been ordered must fail. If the only vice in the joint trial arose from judicial rulings about cross-examination made on 26 and 30 October 2000, there cannot have been any error in the decision made on 17 October 2000 to permit the joint trial to start. Further, counsel for Ismunandar at the trial indicated on 30 October 2000 that he was not making any application for a separate trial at that stage. For the trial judge to continue with the joint trial at that stage was thus not erroneous. The argument to this Court was essentially that the convictions could not stand because the fact that the trial was joint created, in the events which happened, a miscarriage.  
      
       
     163 The objections and rulings of which complaint is made arose in the following way.  
      
       
     164 On 26 October 2000 Chan was being cross-examined by counsel for Ismunandar. He had been in the witness box since 18 October. He had been called by the Crown, had given brief evidence in chief, had given extensive evidence under questioning by the Crown after a successful application under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995, and had been extensively cross-examined by counsel for Lau, Chen and Siregar. The cross-examination by counsel for Ismunandar proceeded for 34 pages until Chan was asked whether it was Lau who had recruited him. His answer was objected to as non-responsive by counsel for Lau. After argument about that objection, the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I’m going to preclude you asking those questions, any question which tends to show that Chan is more or less important than Lau or that Fei Lou Nam does nor doesn’t exist. Anything within that kind of area I am going to preclude you on the basis it can have no relevance to your case.” 
         
        
       
     165 Questioning then proceeded without incident until Chan was asked questions about events after the rice bags were transferred by the speedboat to the Uniana on 15 September 1998. The transcript then records: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You told us that Lau wanted nothing to do with this operation after these bags had come on? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I reject that question. 
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: Q. You say that there was a note written in Chinese that had the details with the blocks on it? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I reject that question, simply on the basis of relevance … to your case. 
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: I won’t press it at this stage your Honour.” 
         
        
        
       There was no complaint about the rejection of the latter question in this appeal. 
        
       
     166 A little later Chan was then asked whether he was going to give evidence against the four Chinese men arrested near Grant’s Beach on 14 October 1998 who, on the Crown case, were to take receipt of the drugs. The trial judge rejected the question, and then rejected a question about whether Chan’s appeal on sentence was still on foot. After the next departure of the jury from court, the trial judge invited counsel for Ismunandar to explain why the rejected questions were relevant. That argument continued on the next sitting day, 30 October 2000. As a result, the trial judge decided that he would allow questions about the relative involvement of Chan and Lau. The trial judge also decided that he would not allow questions about Chan’s appeal, and about whether Chan was proposing to give evidence against the four Chinese men arrested at Grant’s Beach. The trial judge said the questions were irrelevant. Thereafter the cross-examination of Chan continued for about another 40 pages.  
      
       
     167 The Crown submitted to this Court, and there is great force in the submission, that it is almost impossible to work out from the transcript precisely why counsel was contending that the requested questions were relevant.  
      
       
        
       The appellants’ arguments  
        
       
     168 The arguments of Ismunandar and Siregar to this Court were as follows. The arguments were advanced primarily by counsel for Ismunandar and adopted by counsel for Siregar. 
      
       
     169 Counsel for Ismunandar complains that the trial judge was wrong in rejecting questions about the extent and nature of the relationship between Chan and Lau and the relevant importance of Chan in the conspiracy. Whether or not he was initially wrong, he eventually permitted that type of questioning, and the complaint is baseless.  
      
       
     170 To this Court counsel for Ismunandar also complains that the trial judge was wrong in refusing to permit an examination of the relationship between Chan and the four Chinese men at Grant’s Beach. That was not what the trial judge did. All he did was refuse to permit questioning about whether Chan would give evidence against them. Whether he did was a matter outside his control and within the control of the Crown, and hence was not something that he could usefully speak about. In any event, Crown counsel told the court that the Crown did not propose to call them. In due course counsel for Ismunandar said he withdrew the question. And even if the debates between the trial judge and counsel are read as indicating a complete rejection of any questioning about the relationship between Chan and the four Chinese men – an issue difficult to deal with, as Crown counsel pointed out to the trial judge, except by consideration of specific questions one after the other, and a conclusion that it was unlikely that the trial judge would have come to in the absence of specific questions to rule on – that conclusion was justifiable. Counsel for Ismunandar said he wished to show that Chan was seeking to protect other members of the syndicate. He accepted that he had no instructions from Ismunandar that Chan knew anything about the four men on the beach and there was no evidence that he did. The relations between Chan and the four Chinese men on the beach were incapable of casting light on what Ismunandar had done and seen and what inferences as to his knowledge could be drawn about his experiences of what he had done and seen. A minimisation by Chan of their role had no impact on the strength or weakness of the case against Ismunandar.  
      
       
     171 Finally, to this Court counsel for Ismunandar complained that his predecessor was prevented from asking about Chan’s appeal against sentence. We agree with the trial judge’s view that that line was irrelevant. The extent of Chan’s co-operation with the authorities and the possible effects on his reliability had been fully explored. The fact that he might seek to persuade an appellate court that his sentence was too heavy did not bear on his reliability. The fact that he might be seeking to minimise his role was relevant to his reliability, but the fact that, whatever his role, he was seeking to have his sentence reduced on appeal was not. It is highly unlikely that his performance as a witness in the trial before Shadbolt DCJ would assist in reducing his sentence, though an unsatisfactory performance might lead to its being increased otherwise than on appeal. Even if Chan had any personal perception that his appeal prospects would be improved by taking a certain testimonial line, it is highly unlikely that that would have led to any risk of a miscarriage of justice in view of the numerous positions Chan had already adopted on various issues at various stages, and the damaging nature of the cross-examination to which he had been exposed.  
      
       
     172 The matter can be approached from first principles as follows. If counsel for Ismunandar was seeking to explore the issue of Chan’s appeal as going to Chan’s credit, which is a possible view of what he was attempting to say in the relevant exchanges, the evidence would only have been admissible if it were to be of “substantial probative value” on credit: s 103(1). Counsel for Ismunandar did not demonstrate either to the trial judge or this Court that it would have substantial probative value. If counsel for Ismunandar was seeking to explore the issue of Chan’s appeal as going to an issue in the case, the question is whether any evidence elicited, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding: s 55(1). The facts in issue relating to Ismunandar were facts to do with his knowledge. Similarly, the facts in issue relating to Siregar were facts to do with his knowledge. Chan’s concerns about not having been justly sentenced could not relatively affect the probability of either Ismunandar or Siregar having the necessary knowledge. Further, as the trial judge said in argument, that line of questioning would open up side issues: it would require “a deal of explanation to a jury about the appeal process in this State”.  
      
       
        
       The “passport photo” 
        
       
     173 The complaint about the trial judge’s rejection of “the tender of the passport photo Chan had in his possession upon landing at the beach” has the following background. Near the end of the cross-examination of Chan by counsel for Ismunandar, the transcript records the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You told us Mr Chan that you – in relation to this passport photo that you always carried one is that right? I call for the travel pass. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s produced. 
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: I tender that. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: I presume the witness will identify it your Honour, I don’t object to the tender. Do you want to show it to the witness or are you just tendering it? 
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: It can be shown to the witness please. … 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Could I have a look at it please. What’s the relevance of this? 
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: Your Honour Mr Chan says he didn’t have any intention of staying in Australia, he had no knowledge of this alternative passport that was found on the beach in the sand, that the reason why he had the passport photo --- 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I’m asking what the relevance of this is? 
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: Yes your Honour that’s the travel pass I suggest that he --- 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: What’s the relevance of it? 
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL]: It illustrates your Honour that Chan is lying. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I reject the tender of it in your case.” 
         
        
       
     174 Counsel for Ismunandar submitted that: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was at least one available inference from the possession of that photo Mr Chan planned to stay in Australia (he having previously had the opportunity at least when in Australia to make the appropriate arrangements) to assist in distributing the heroin and he was being untruthful when denying this was part of his role. It was also consistent with the fact at least one part of the voyage’s purpose was to smuggle people into Australia. This evidence it is submitted was relevant and should have been admitted. Also makes the proposition more viable he had rather more knowledge of the members of the meeting party than he conceded if he was planning to thereafter remain with the heroin after it landed and also presumably in company with those four men and/or their associates in Australia.” 
         
        
       
     175 There is no evidence that the document was a “passport photo”, or that it was an “alternative passport … found on the beach in the sand”. What the trial judge rejected was the tender of a travel pass. According to the Crown, with whom counsel appearing before this Court did not disagree, the document showed only the dates of Chan’s trips to China. Counsel for Ismunandar at the trial did not demonstrate how it showed Chan to be a liar. Counsel for Ismunandar on the appeal did not demonstrate how the travel pass supported an inference either that Chan planned to stay in Australia or that the purpose of the voyage was to smuggle people into Australia or that he had knowledge of members of the “meeting party”. 
      
       
        
       Miscarriage of justice 
        
       
     176 Even if the trial judge erred in restricting the cross-examination of Chan or in rejecting the travel pass, neither Ismunandar nor Siregar has demonstrated any miscarriage of justice. No cross-examination of them, and no proof that he was a liar, could have damaged his credibility more than the four defence counsel and Crown counsel did between them as it was. So far as questioning about Chan’s appeal in particular is concerned, counsel for Ismunandar leapfrogged the evidentiary gap of which Ismunandar now complains by submitting in final address: 
      
       
        
         
         “I wonder how his appeal is going to go, the audacity for Chan to appeal after his massive discount.” 
         
        
       
     177 The grounds of appeal just discussed are without validity. 
      
       
        
       Ismunandar Ground 3 and Siregar Ground 3: the directions on Chan’s evidence 
        
        
       The grounds of appeal 
        
       
     178 Ground 3 was: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour erred in failing to appropriately direct the jury in respect to the accomplice Chan’s evidence in accordance with s 165 Evidence Act, 1995 as it applied in the case against the Appellant.” 
         
        
       
     179 It is convenient also to consider Ground 3 of Siregar’s Further Amended Grounds of Appeal: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour erred by failing to give a proper and/or adequate direction regarding how the jury should approach the evidence given by Chan.” 
         
        
        
       The summing up 
        
       
     180 The part of the summing up complained of was: 
      
       
        
         
         “I now wish to make some remarks and give you some directions of law in regard to Chan’s evidence. Experience has shown that it is dangerous to convict on the evidence of an accomplice alone. Accomplices to a crime have much to gain and little to lose in giving evidence for the Crown. Fear of consequences, remorse, revenge, blame shifting and spite might provide motive enough for an accomplice to give evidence against a fellow criminal. He may have committed himself to a version of events which he cannot now change. Further encouragement might come from an offer of a shorter sentence or the ignoring of other crime. The problem which jurors have with such evidence of people who are criminally concerned is that you never know where the true motivation might be and it may never be revealed to you. What then is a person who is criminally concerned, or an accomplice? He is in fact an accessory before the fact or a principal or an accessory after the fact. That is, he is a person who helps in the preparation of the crime or commits a crime or assists a criminal to escape liability. There seems to be absolutely no doubt that Mr Chan falls firmly into that category. It is of course a matter for you [to] determine but once you form that view, it is dangerous to convict on that evidence alone. Corroboration or evidence from outside Chan’s evidence should be considered to see if support can be obtained for the account which he has given. 
         
        
        
         
         There is evidence in this case which is capable of corroborating or supporting Chan’s account of events. For instance, what he says about the arrest on the beach is confirmed by that strange video that you have seen and the evidence of Zuccato. The arrest of the Uniana is evidence which has been put before you. The secret compartment or the void space as the Crown refers to it, is to be seen on the video that you have. The lowering of the speedboat, you have pictures of that and of course you have the evidence of two accused in relation to the lowering and retrieving and the lowering yet once again of the speedboat. The voyage from the Malaccas is to be found in the log. Taking on board Chen and the heroin is to be found in Chen’s own evidence. And the launching of the speedboat at Port Macquarie has the support of Chen’s evidence and the evidence of Siregar and Ismunandar. Chan’s reconnoitring journey to Australia may be confirmed in your mind by the entries in the passport and his journey to Cambodia likewise though there is evidence which lies outside Chan’s own evidence which would tend to support certain parts of his account of events. 
         
        
        
         
         But how should you deal with his evidence, because there are big discrepancies within the evidence itself and at this stage, this is not, strictly speaking, a [direction] of law but just a suggestion to you from me as to how you might deal with Chan’s evidence in your fact finding and fact determining task. 
         
        
        
         
         You recall that he gave two conflicting accounts of his relations with Lau. Firstly he told police that it was Lau who recruited him and sent him on this reconnaissance journey to Australia. Subsequently, in statements which he made some months later, he says that he recruited Lau and Lau was no more than a virtually accidental participant in the enterprise. 
         
        
        
         
         You can, if you wish, accept either of those or neither of them, that is a matter entirely for you. But in examining those two you could look to the surrounding circumstances, that is, that the first record of interview of Chan was taken probably about an hour and twenty minutes after his arrest. The second two statements were taken much later, after he has spent some short period of time with Lau as cell mate in the prison where they were housed. And there is of course a third statement which came to light after cross-examination in other proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         So you can look to the surrounding circumstances to see how the statements came into being. Secondly, you could look to see whether you accept one account or the other when you compare it with your own experience of life. For instance, in the second account Lau is unemployed and needs a job. When you look to other evidence like the accounts not precisely at this time but in the months before and a little time afterwards, 18.4 million dollars has gone through his account and his employment is without wages and without a particular time limitation or without any perhaps, real purpose. 
         
        
        
         
         Then you can look to the lies which Chan has told which the Crown has itemised, if you accept that they are lies. And you can look at the demeanour of Chan when he was cross-examined about these matters. What you would be doing in that case is to say as you inspect his evidence, I would accept that of him because it is confirmed by other pieces of evidence. I would not accept that because it either offends my sense of how things actually work in the real world or in the alternative, because there is no corroboration for that particular piece of evidence. When you do that, you can separate out as it were, those matters of Chan’s evidence that you would accept and those which you would reject. I just wanted you to move away from any thought that you would just choose one account or the other or neither on some impressionistic feel. I think you can analyse what he has said to you and accept parts and reject other parts or of course you can, if you wish, reject the whole lot of it.  
         
        
        
         
         That I might say is not specifically a direction of law, it is just my suggestion to you as to how you deal with the difficult question of Chan’s evidence.” 
         
        
        
       The submissions on behalf of Ismunandar  
        
       
     181 Counsel for Ismunandar submitted that: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour does not detail the Crown case against the appellant on the issue of knowledge critically relied upon Chan’s evidence to the effect he must have been aware of the repackaging of the heroin on the night Chen is picked up because of the light which was used, the open hatch cover and the appellant’s position on the bridge (the appellant denied in evidence he saw a light and significantly that the hatch cover was open); and that contrary to prior inconsistent statements by Chan the version given by him at trial meant at least the Captain and/or one or more of the Indonesian crew must have been involved in the storage of the sports bag in the secret compartment – thus permitting the inference the appellant as first officer and on watch would have been aware of this activity. For it is submitted it was these matters with the findings of like bags in the appellant’s cabin which, if there was any proper basis for a finding beyond reasonable doubt of his knowledge, actually constituted the crucial considerations.” 
         
        
       
     182 Counsel for Ismunandar also submitted that the jury should have been told that in evaluating Chan’s evidence, he was minimising his own role, particularly bearing in mind the outstanding appeal, and minimising the roles of the Chinese members of his group (including the four Chinese men on Grant’s Beach) at the expense of the Indonesian crew. (So far as these submissions, and the corresponding submissions on behalf of Siregar, repeat the complaints dealt with above about the supposed restrictions placed by the trial judge on counsel for Ismunandar’s cross-examination of Chan, they are rejected for the reasons already given.) 
      
       
     183 Finally, counsel for Ismunandar submitted that the accomplice warning was tailored more to the position of Lau than to that of Ismunandar.  
      
       
        
       The submissions on behalf of Siregar 
        
       
     184 Counsel for Siregar submitted that Chan was “not only inherently unreliable but manifestly unreliable”. If this is really true, that circumstance obviated any need for an unreliability direction of any kind. However, the submission continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is submitted that his Honour’s summing up required strong and careful directions including directions on the following matters: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) Generally the dangers of accomplice evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) The potential dangers in this case because of the terms of Chan’s sentence and his undertaking to the Crown in respect of his evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) The possibility of an appeal by the Crown in relation to sentence and Chan’s perception that his evidence may need to be tailored to meet that consideration. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) Chan’s minimisation of his own role and the lies which he told in that respect. 
         
        
        
         
         (e) Chan’s protection of other persons involved in the Chinese organisation including Fei Lo Nam, the Hong Kong Chinese at Grant’s Beach, Fei Chi, Poon and Frankie. 
         
        
        
         
         (f) Chan’s involvement in the elaborate preparations for this drug smuggling venture. 
         
        
        
         
         (g) The lies which Chan told to various courts in these and related proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         (h) The lies told by Chan to the police. 
         
        
        
         
         (i) Chan’s attempts to inculpate Siregar including: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (i) different and contradictory versions concerning Siregar coming in to the hold area when the bags had been brought on board the Uniana; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          (ii) his lies concerning Frankie; 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (iii) his lies concerning his role in the work on the derrick which were only exposed under cross examination in court in earlier proceedings; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (iv) generally the dissembling of Chan in relation to the Uniana in respect of the welding of the derrick; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (v) the real likelihood that Chan was lying in respect of his Malaysian and Cambodian trip; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (vi) his belated attempt to inculpate Siregar by saying that he would have taken Siregar with him to Australia; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (vii) Chan’s reluctance to give details of the Hong Kong Chinese in Australia and their involvement in the importation; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (viii) Chan’s reluctant to give evidence against the Hong Kong Chinese; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (ix) Chan’s lies concerning the GPS evidence which he gave concerning his previous trip to Australia and the involvement of Fei Chai; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (x) the exculpatory lies which he gave to the Court concerning his knowledge of the drugs and his evidence that he was going to flee once he discovered there were drugs on board – as compared and contrasted with his plea of guilty to being knowingly concerned in the importation; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (xi) the dangers of Chan’s evidence in light of the clear financial arrangements made for the journey by the Chinese and the financial rewards which would have flowed to the Chinese as compared to proof of no financial advantage to the Indonesian crew, including Siregar, other than their normal wages and a small bonus for a slightly longer journey; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          (xii) a general direction concerning lies told by Chan; 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (xiii) a further direction of the danger in accepting Chan where both the Crown and the defence submit to the jury that [in] various respects Chan is not a witness of truth.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     185 In oral argument the summing up was described by counsel for Siregar as “unfair and woefully inadequate”, because the role of Chan meant that the case was “drizzled with danger”. Counsel complained that the trial judge did not take the jury through the detailed cross-examination of Chan on inconsistencies in his evidence on the issue of the derrick and of Siregar looking into the hold and indeed “completely ignored” it. He said that the only function of the trial judge’s discussion of Chan’s lies and inconsistencies was to permit the jury to infer the strength of parts of the Crown case, and that the jury were not told how they could use Chan’s lies and inconsistencies to discredit the parts of the Crown case which told against the accused.  
      
       
     186 Counsel for Siregar relied on various authorities. In particular he drew attention to R v Checconi (1988) 34 A Crim R 160 at 173, where it was said that the defences in that case could not be adequately put “without some analysis, or at least summary, of the grounds” of the defence attacks on an accomplice. In R v Schmahl [1965] VR 745 an appeal succeeded because of a failure by the trial judge in that case to relate the general principles as to the use of prior inconsistent statements to the factual issues in the case, “where an important part of the defence was derived from inconsistencies in the Crown case, and where so much depended on the reliability of the witness” who made the inconsistent statements.  
      
       
        
       Events during and after the summing up 
        
       
     187 The trial judge began summing up on 16 November 2000. At the next adjournment counsel for Ismunandar raised a problem with the trial judge’s directions on circumstantial evidence. The trial judge indicated that he would deal with submissions at the end of the summing up. 
      
       
     188 The summing up continued in the afternoon of 16 November 2000 and the morning of 17 November 2000. When the summing up ended, counsel for Lau asked for the whole summing up to be withdrawn and for the jury to be discharged. Counsel for Siregar made the same application and then made a brief submission about a matter other than the accomplice direction. Counsel for Ismunandar applied for the whole summing up to be withdrawn and for the jury to be discharged. In the event that that application failed, he made a number of specific requests for redirections, including the one foreshadowed the day before about circumstantial evidence. He did not ask for a redirection about Chan’s evidence. Rule 4 thus applies in relation to both Ismunandar and Siregar.  
      
       
     189 Counsel for Ismunandar characterised his complaint as turning on a failure to give a proper direction under s 165 of the Evidence Act. That direction need not be given unless a party applies for it to be given: s 165(2). Counsel for Ismunandar at the trial did not argue that it be given. Further rule 4 problems thus arise. The failure of counsel for Ismunandar to ask for a s 165 direction before the summing up, and the failure of him and all other counsel to ask for any improvement in what the trial judge said after the summing up, can, in view of the importance which Chan’s evidence had in the trial, only be accounted for by a collective belief either that the dangers were, after sections of examination in chief by the Crown counsel, sections of s 38 examination by the Crown, and four cross-examinations by the accused, so obvious that no warning was needed or that the warning which was given was satisfactory. Each defence counsel strongly attacked Chan’s reliability in cross-examination. The collective experience of defence counsel was considerable. The position is highlighted by the posture of counsel for Ismunandar at the trial. Generally speaking the other counsel took the approach that the summing up should be withdrawn and the jury discharged, but, apart from one direction about circumstantial evidence, they did not seek particular redirections. Counsel for Ismunandar sought a discharge, but in the alternative made eight applications for specific redirections on particular matters, in a manner casting credit on his technical ability because of their precision. He thereby revealed the operation of a judgment which was much more sound than any this Court would be likely to make without assistance as to alleged errors which he perceived to be troublesome from his client’s point of view and those which he did not. For those reasons leave under rule 4 would ordinarily be refused.  
      
       
        
       The arguments considered at a general level 
        
       
     190 In order to see whether there was a miscarriage of justice it is convenient to consider whether, assuming a s 165 application had been made, s 165 was complied with.  
      
       
     191 If the summing up is viewed from the point of view of s 165(2), it cannot be said that the trial judge failed to warn the jury that Chan’s evidence may be unreliable, failed to inform the jury of matters that might cause it to be unreliable, and failed to warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. He warned about the general unreliability of accomplices and the particular unreliability of Chan. The discrepancies, conflicts and possible lies in his evidence were referred to. The trial judge warned about the reason for Chan’s possible unreliability, particularly the desire to reduce the evil consequences of a long sentence. He warned of the need for caution because of the danger of convicting on uncorroborated evidence. The grounds of appeal under consideration are similar to Ground 4(a) advanced by Chen and Ground 6(a) advanced by Lau. What was said about them earlier has some application here too.  
      
       
     192 If the direction is measured against the requirements of a corroboration warning at common law, it is not defective. So far as the appellants complain about an excessive emphasis on material favouring the Crown case, it must be remembered that in a",2002-06-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, TNT, has pleaded guilty to the murder of HHL in the south western suburbs of Sydney on 7 August 1996. 
     
      
    2 I am indebted to the Crown prosecutor for the following succinct summary of the facts: 
     
      
       
        
        “About 3.40 pm on Wednesday 7 August 1996 HHL, student, aged 18 years, (born 31.7.78), was sitting in the Sunshine coffee shop near the entrance to Bankstown Railway Station talking to a friend … when the offender, then aged 16 years (born 5.5.80), MHN aged 17 years (born 11.10.78), HLD, aged 18 years (born 17.4.78) and a number of other men entered. The offender approached HHL, put his arm around his shoulder and asked him if a schoolbag lying nearby on the floor was his. When HHL acknowledged ownership of the bag, HLD picked it up. The offender, with his arm still around HHL’s shoulder and with the others, led him from the shop. 
        
       
       
        
        HHL was taken by the offender, MHN and others to a Corona station wagon which was parked nearby and driven to a park in Augusta Street, Bankstown near the Bankstown City Sports Complex where he was assaulted by the offender, MHN and two of the other men. An eye witness, RF, saw two of the group on their knees punching HHL as he was lying on the ground whilst the other two in the group were kicking him. 
        
       
       
        
        As RF approached, the group of men stopped assaulting HHL. One of them assisted HHL to walk from the park to the Corona station wagon which was parked in nearby Antwerp Street. The four men who had been assaulting HHL boarded the vehicle with him. HHL was seated in the middle of the back seat with one of the men on each side of him. The vehicle was then driven off. 
        
       
       
        
        HHL was driven to a residence at 3 Kamira Street, Villawood and taken inside by the offender, MHN and others. With his wrists bound in front of his body, he was later placed in a bedroom and imprisoned there. 
        
       
       
        
        Later HHL was taken to a garage at that address where he was punched by MHN, the offender, HLD and a man named Gwyn. HHL was also struck across the back of the head twice by MHN with a piece of timber. MHN then tried unsuccessfully to kill him by strangling him with a length of wire. MHN then stabbed him in the throat. HHL died shortly afterwards. 
        
       
       
        
        Later that evening, the offender, MHN and HLD dumped HHL’s body at a construction site in Orchard Road, Chester Hill. 
        
       
       
        
        About 6.30 am on the following morning, Thursday 8 August 1996, his body was found at the construction site. He was then laying face up with his upper garment pulled up exposing his mid section. There was dry sand adhering to his face and mid section. There was dried blood around several lacerations to his throat and on the top section of his upper garment. There was blood staining on the sand under his head and throat. The blood staining had been absorbed by the sand to a depth of 25 mm. Above his head for a length of 1.2 metres there was an area of disturbance in the sand running generally in a north/south direction consistent with dragging of the body from the nearby roadway. 
        
       
       
        
        Later that morning Dr Peter Bradhurst, forensic pathologist, attended and conducted an examination of HHL’s body. From the rectal temperature taken from the body, the ambient temperature at the scene and other information, Dr Bradhurst estimated death to have occurred by 7.30 pm on the 7 August 1996 or a little later.” 
        
       
      
    3 During a post mortem examination, Dr Bradhurst observed several serious head injuries, evidence of strangulation and of stabbing to the throat, and a number of bruises and abrasions to the face and other parts of the body. He concluded that the head injuries were inflicted first, followed by the strangulation and then the stabbing, those injuries being inflicted whilst the deceased was still alive. He was also of the opinion that the head injuries, the strangulation and the stabbing, viewed individually, could have been fatal. 
     
      
    4 When first interviewed by police about the matter early in 1997, the offender denied any knowledge of it. However, he disclosed his involvement in a subsequent electronically recorded interview of 11 October 2000. He gave evidence before me which was to much the same effect. I shall return to his account in a moment. 
     
      
    5 An extraordinary feature of this case is that a little over a week before the killing of HHL, on 31 July 1996, the offender himself killed another man, TCL. He pleaded guilty to that murder, and on 3 May 2002 he was sentenced by Sully J to imprisonment for 14 years, commencing from his arrest on 5 October 2000, with a non parole period of 9 years. He was also sentenced to a concurrent term of imprisonment for a related offence to which I need not refer. On that occasion he shot TCL dead in what his Honour described as “a gangland killing … against a sinister background of conflict arising out of illicit drug trafficking” (para 37 of his Honour’s remarks on sentence). Also implicated in that killing were the man MHN and two brothers, NPP and NVP.  
     
      
    6 The two murders were unconnected but, as far as the offender is concerned, there was the common thread of the malign influence of MHN. To understand this it is necessary to sketch the offender’s background. The evidence about that matter which is before me was also before Sully J. His Honour summarised it in this way (paras 14-19): 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner was born on 5 May 1980 in Vietnam. At the instance of his mother, who wanted a better life for him than he could expect to have in Vietnam, he came to Australia in 1993. He travelled with a maternal uncle, and the uncle’s wife and children. The party travelled via Malaysia and Indonesia, spending about 3 years in a refugee camp in Indonesia. In Australia the prisoner attended school at Cabramatta High School for about a year. There he made the acquaintance of NPP who was somewhat older, and who was a year or two ahead of the prisoner at school. 
        
       
       
        
        After about six or seven months of living with his uncle and the uncle’s family, the prisoner spent a few months living with an older cousin; and he then went back to Vietnam in order to visit his parents. He stayed in Vietnam for about six months. 
        
       
       
        
        Upon his return to Australia, he found that his uncle had moved interstate with his family. The prisoner, then aged about 15 years, was thus effectively homeless. He was taken in for a couple of months by the family of a school friend, and he got a factory job. He then drifted, unfortunately, into bad company. He began to use prohibited drugs. He left his job and the friend’s home, and drifted for a time as, put simply and colloquially, a street kid. 
        
       
       
        
        In that unpromising context he met again, and was taken up by, NPP, who took him into his, NPP’s own home. By that time the prisoner had joined a gang of youths called the Madonna Boys. This gang operated, broadly speaking as two affiliated groups, one centred on Cabramatta, the other on Bankstown. NPP was associated with the Cabramatta group; and MHN was, effectively, the controller of the Bankstown group. 
        
       
       
        
        While the prisoner lived with NPP, he was drawn by NPP into a life of serious crime involving heroin trafficking; serious larcenies; and intimidation accompanied on occasion by physical violence. According to the prisoner, he was effectively exploited and manipulated by NPP. 
        
       
       
        
        After a few months, the prisoner moved out of NPP’s home, and went to stay with a friend, and the friend’s family, at Bankstown. There he came under the influence of MHN. According to the prisoner, he was effectively exploited and manipulated by MHN in essentially the same way as had been his experience with NPP.” 
        
       
      
    7 It was the offender’s case that he was effectively coerced into killing TCL, whom he did not know, by NPP and MHN: particularly, it would seem, by NPP. His Honour considered it a reasonable possibility that his actions were the result of “some such pressure …”. In the present case it is common ground that he was acting at the behest, and under the influence, of MHN. In October 1998 MHN pleaded guilty to the murder of HHL and was sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment by Kirby J. The evidence before Kirby J was significantly different from that which I have received, and counsel are agreed that I need not have regard to his Honour’s sentence in dealing with the present offender. 
     
      
    8 I accept that the offender was effectively under the control of MHN and that he was afraid of him. MHN had a reputation for violence and the offender had seen episodes of it. It seems that he now has a formidable record for offences of violence which, apart from the murder of HHL, includes another murder and a manslaughter. 
     
      
    9 The offender’s account of the extent of his involvement in the killing of HHL is unchallenged. Like the victim of the previous murder, he did not know HHL. He drove MHN to the coffee shop in a borrowed vehicle, believing that HHL was to be beaten but not killed. He did not know what MHN had against HHL, although on the way to the park near the Bankstown City Sports Complex MHN said something to HHL about leaving his family alone. At the park the offender participated in the assault on HHL to the extent of hitting him once or twice. However, he and one of the other men restrained MHN when he removed one of his boots and began to strike HHL on the head with it. 
     
      
    10 When HHL was returned to the car the offender thought that they were going back to Bankstown to drop him off, but MHN instructed him to drive to the house at Villawood which, as it happened, was the home of NPP. There, when HHL was taken from the bedroom to the garage, the offender said that he wanted to leave but MHN demanded that he stay. He asked MHN to let HHL go but MHN refused, saying that he feared reprisals by HHL against his family. In the garage the offender punched HHL once. When MHN hit HHL with the piece of timber, he said that the matter had gone far enough and that he could not handle it. 
     
      
    11 Any doubt about MHN’s intention to kill HHL was put to rest when he attempted to strangle him with the wire. HHL struggled, and MHN instructed the offender and HLD to hold his legs. The offender did so, knowing that MHN was bent upon killing HHL. He left the garage and was not present when MHN stabbed HHL in the throat, although MHN told him immediately afterwards what he had done. As already observed, he then assisted in conveying HHL’s body to the building site at Chester Hill. 
     
      
    12 In December 1996 the offender was arrested and charged with assaulting HHL and detaining him for advantage. He was in custody for about nine months until he was granted bail by a judge of this Court. I propose to take that period of custody into account in sentencing him. Those charges later came on for hearing at a Children’s Court and he was acquitted of both of them. After he was released on bail he sought to disassociate himself from the Madonna Boys. Sully J narrated what then ensued as follows (paras 34 and 36 of his remarks): 
     
      
       
        
        “Shortly thereafter he was seriously assaulted by a group of Asian youths. According to the police and hospital records …, the attack occurred in the Viet Hoa Plaza at Cabramatta at about 2.30 p.m. on 20 October 1997. The prisoner suffered severe lacerations to his head; his general condition being noted in the police report as “serious but not life threatening”. The prisoner was so traumatised by the attack that on 24 October he walked out of the hospital to which he had been admitted on 20 October. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        After leaving hospital the prisoner went to his girl friend’s house, where he remained until he had made a complete recovery. His girl friend became pregnant to him. He agreed thereupon with her and with her family that he and she would move interstate, which they did. Thereafter he made a life for himself and his de facto wife, and in due course for their daughter. So things continued until his arrest in October 2000, since when he has been in witness protection custody in this State.” 
        
       
      
    13 He admitted the killing of TCL in an interview with police of 5 October 2000, undertaking to give evidence against others who were also involved. He has recently done so in a trial before Sully J. Following his undertaking to assist the authorities, he was placed in protective custody in the Special Purpose Prison at Long Bay and he has remained there since. On 10 October 2000 he told police that he was prepared to be interviewed about another matter and, as I have said, he admitted his involvement in the killing of HHL in an interview the following day. The Crown prosecutor has acknowledged that, but for his admissions in that interview, there was no case against him. Again, he undertook to give evidence against others involved in this killing and it is anticipated that he will give evidence for the Crown in the trial of HLD which is about to commence before me. 
     
      
    14 The offender has always been prepared to plead guilty to whatever might be the appropriate charge against him in relation to the death of HHL. It is in the nature of things that any person requires legal advice before pleading guilty to murder and, indeed, there were specific reasons in this case why that advice was called for. In all the circumstances, the Crown accepts that his plea of guilty was entered at the earliest reasonable opportunity. His remorse is demonstrated by that plea of guilty and by his unsolicited disclosure of his criminality, and it was expressed in his evidence and in a psychological report which is before me. 
     
      
    15 The offender lived a blameless life in Melbourne after he moved there with his girlfriend. He obtained employment in a motor vehicle business, the proprietor of which became what is known in Vietnamese culture as his “godfather”, a relationship of considerable significance. That gentleman, KH, gave evidence attesting to the offender’s honesty and industriousness, together with his devotion to his child. Consistently with their special relationship, KH has assured him of his continuing support. Similar evidence of his good character was given by DS, also employed in KH’s business, and appears in a statement by the offender’s girlfriend. She has since married another man but the offender maintains regular telephone contact with their daughter. 
     
      
    16 Like Sully J, I consider that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour found special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between sentence and non-parole period and it is common ground that I should do so, in the light of the offender’s subjective circumstances and also because he will have to serve the whole of the custodial component of his sentence in protective custody. 
     
      
    17 The crime for which he faces sentence is very serious indeed involving, as it does, his participation in a brutal killing. Moreover, it was committed not long after he had killed another man. On the other hand, the two murders must be understood in the light of the milieu in which he was then living and, in particular, the influence upon him of NPP and MHN. His involvement in the murder of HHL, viewed objectively, is not as serious as the previous killing. The Crown prosecutor recognised as much, acknowledging that the sentence I pass should be less than that imposed by Sully J, although not markedly so. 
     
      
    18 Grave as this crime is, appropriate weight should be given to the offender’s youth at the time: R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37, at paras 22-25. Particularly is this so given his disturbed background and the virtual absence of any nurturing during his formative years. I am persuaded by the Crown prosecutor’s submission that the sentence for this offence should be wholly cumulative upon the non-parole period fixed by Sully J, although I will backdate it to a date nine months earlier than the expiration of that period in recognition of the time the offender had previously spent in custody as a result of the incident. That being so, considerations of totality demand some moderation of the sentence which might otherwise have been appropriate. In addition, the accumulation provides a further reason to reduce the non-parole period which I set, so as to ensure that he remains eligible for release on parole for a significant period of time. 
     
      
    19 The fact that the offender sought out the police to disclose his involvement in this crime raises considerations akin to those expressed by Street CJ in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. It is against that background that the value of his plea of guilty, upon which I have already commented, should be assessed. His willingness to give evidence for the Crown in the trial of HLD is significant, particularly in the light of the evidence of the police officer in charge of the investigation that this is unusual in the South East Asian community.  
     
      
    20 I propose to quantify in a broad, global way the leniency which these matters have earned him: R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, per Spigelman CJ at para 160(ii). Although Sully J did not take that course, I am satisfied that I should do so. But for those matters, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 20 years. In the light of them, I reduce that sentence by fifty percent to 10 years. I specify a non-parole period of 6 years. Notwithstanding a powerful subjective case, the offender’s criminality is of a high order and I do not consider that any lesser sentence or non-parole period could be justified. The non-parole period set by Sully J would expire on 4 October 2009 and, as I have said, the sentence which I pass will commence nine months earlier. 
     
      
    21 TNT, you are sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years, to commence on 5 January 2009, with a non-parole period of 6 years. You will now be eligible for release on parole on 5 January 2015.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the Applicant by his Honour Judge Christie QC. The Applicant pleaded guilty to one charge of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to s52A(4) of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstance of aggravation was that he had a blood concentration of alcohol of 0.190 grammes per 100 millilitres. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. He was disqualified from driving for a period of three years from the date of sentence. 
      
       
     2 The circumstances of the accident were as follows. In the early hours of Monday, 2 October 2000, the Applicant was driving a four wheel drive Landcruiser in a westerly direction along Canterbury Road, Sydney. At about 12.53am he approached the intersection of Ferncroft Parade and, in contravention of traffic control lights, turned right into the path of a Ducati motorcycle ridden by Darren Morris. Mr Morris suffered serious injuries including a broken pelvis, right leg, right elbow and left wrist. His injuries required the insertion of plates and screws. At the time of the accident the Applicant’s licence was suspended in relation to charges which were not, in the event, proceeded with. 
      
       
     3 The Applicant had two prior drink driving convictions for high range prescribed concentration of alcohol. However, these offences had occurred in 1989 and 1991. The Applicant’s drinking habits which resulted in these two prior offences had subsequently changed. The significance to be accorded to these prior convictions was limited, not only by reason of the length of time that had transpired since they were recorded, but also by reason of the circumstances in which the Applicant commenced to drink again. 
      
       
     4 In October 1998 his only child was murdered in a widely publicised gang attack. The Applicant suffered deeply from this loss. His Honour drew the inference that the resumption of his previous drinking habits was caused by the tragedy that had befallen himself and his wife. The medical evidence to which his Honour referred contained an assessment that he was suffering from depression. One doctor indicated that his behaviour was exacerbated around the anniversary of his son’s murder in October of each year. The offence now before the Court was committed on 2 October 2000. A psychiatrist who saw him expressed the opinion that he was suffering from Bereavement Reaction with Abnormal Features including depression. 
      
       
     5 His Honour emphasised that the subjective circumstances of the Applicant presented a strong case. In the circumstances his Honour concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “I propose to deal with the matter as leniently as the circumstances permit.” 
         
        
       
     6 His Honour noted that after the accident the Applicant had made good progress in controlling his drinking and in view of his significant prospects of rehabilitation proposed to find special circumstances for purposes of determining the relationship between the non-parole period and the total sentence. 
      
       
     7 His Honour made a finding that the Applicant was unlikely to re-offend and that, accordingly, specific deterrence was not a matter entitled to significant weight. His Honour did, however, refer to the need for general deterrence with respect to offences of this character. His Honour made reference to the prevalence of the offence and the seriousness with which the offence has come to be regarded by the community. This is no doubt a reference to the maximum sentences for which the legislation provides and the frequent repetition, over many years, in decisions of this Court of these considerations.  
      
       
     8 In his judgment his Honour referred to this Court’s guideline judgment in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. His Honour quoted from the headnote at 211: 
      
       
        
         
         “Guideline judgments perform a limited role. They are not binding in a formal sense. They are intended to be indicative only.” 
         
        
       
     9 His Honour referred to the list of factors that are relevant to the determination of the appropriate penalty as set out at 231 of Jurisic and identified those which were pertinent to the case before him. He emphasised the degree of intoxication as the consideration entitled to particular weight. Indeed it was that factor which meant that in this case, unlike Jurisic, his Honour was concerned with the aggravated version of the offence for which the maximum penalty was eleven years, rather than the maximum penalty of seven years applicable where the degree of intoxication does not reach the level prescribed for purposes of s52A(4).  
      
       
     10 His Honour referred to that passage in Jurisic at 231 which indicates that one of the aggravating factors is present to a material degree when it may be inferred that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her conduct. He noted that in such circumstances, in the case of a plea of guilty, a custodial sentence of less than two years should be exceptional. His Honour also noted the guide expressed in Jurisic that such period of two years would be a “starting point”.  
      
       
     11 His Honour, who described the subjective case of the present Applicant as “compelling”, also had in mind the emphasis given in Jurisic to the seriousness with which the offence is treated. His Honour did at one point refer to Jurisic as indicating the significance of general deterrence. His Honour also said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I propose to ameliorate as far as I am able on behalf of the prisoner the sentence that would be required, very largely because of the subjective circumstances surrounding the death of his son and the effect that must have had upon his wife and the effect, of course, that his imprisonment will have upon his wife. That is something I must take into account and I propose so to do. But I think the only way that that can be dealt with properly within the guidelines of  
         R v Jurisic 
          and within the requirements of the community is to find special circumstances related very principally to the contents of the Probation and Parole Report and I propose so to do.” 
         
        
       
     12 His Honour went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is not only a need to deter Mr Lee from further offending in this matter, there is, of course, a need to generally deter other citizens likeminded to offend in this way. That position is made perfectly clear by the learned judges in  
         R v Jurisic. 
         
        
        
         
         The maximum penalties for this offence are high. They have increased in recent years because of community concern.” 
         
        
       
     13 His Honour went on to refer to other judgments of this Court and stated that: 
      
       
        
         
         “The  
         Jurisic  
         guidelines would need to be proportionately increased for the aggravated versions of the offences arising in cases of death under s52A(2) … and in cases of grievous bodily harm …” 
         
        
       
     14 His Honour concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “I realise that I have been somewhat lengthy in setting forth some matters largely to acquaint the public with the seriousness with which these offences are these days considered. I propose to deal with the matter as leniently as the circumstances permit, having regard to the subjective circumstance to which I have made reference. The special circumstances that I am prepared to find relate to the rehabilitation prospects of the prisoner and the fact that those rehabilitation prospects appear to have been enhanced over the years since those two convictions to which I made reference by reason of the alteration of his drinking habits. I gained from the Probation and Parole Report that the alteration of those habits has been resumed and that the tragedy that befell this cyclist in October last year is perhaps much less likely to be repeated at least at the hands of the prisoner. I would be quietly confident that the prisoner may be unlikely to re-offend but the need for general deterrence is constantly referred to by the superior courts of this State and I cannot ignore that need.” 
         
        
       
     15 His Honour went on to determine the sentence and also found “special circumstances” of a character enabling him to fix a non-parole period at the level of 50 percent of the head sentence that he imposed. 
      
       
     16 It is of particular significance, in view of some of the matters raised by way of appeal, that his Honour considered in some detail a submission that had been made to him that this was an appropriate case in which to suspend the custodial sentence. His Honour referred to the High Court’s decision in Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 and quoted a number of passages from the judgment of Kirby J in Dinsdale, including his Honour’s statement at [68]: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is true that both by the applicable statute, and by the common law, a primary duty of judges on sentencing is to give due weight to the objective seriousness of the offence.” 
         
        
       
     17 At this point his Honour referred to R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. His Honour proceeded to reject the submission that he should suspend the sentence on the facts of that case. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “But there is here a prisoner who cannot claim to be a young person with no prior convictions. There is here a prisoner who has apparently deliberately opted to drive in circumstances in which the chances of his coming to grief must have been very high, and indeed the prisoner is a person who has had previous experience, dare I say it, considerable experience with the courts in relation to driving while heavily intoxicated by liquor. I see in the interests of the community not the slightest elbow room to consider the suspension of any part of his sentence.” 
         
        
       
     18 The appeal in this case was heard together with a number of other cases in which this Court was asked to review the continued authority of this Court’s guideline judgments, relevantly R v Jurisic, in light of the decision of the High Court in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 76 ALJR 79. It is not necessary to decide this case on that basis. 
      
       
     19 The Applicant relied on a number of different grounds for his submission that the exercise of discretion by the sentencing judge miscarried. One of these grounds was that his Honour gave inappropriate weight to the starting point in the guidelines, namely a term of two years in a case of the infliction of grievous bodily harm. His Honour made reference to Jurisic but it does not appear to me that his Honour regarded the starting point as constraining the exercise of the discretion. I have quoted above the relevant extracts from his remarks on sentence. The extent to which his Honour adopted the guideline is not entirely apparent. 
      
       
     20 This case can, however, be determined on the basis of another and alternative submission made to the Court. It was submitted that the exercise of the sentencing discretion miscarried by reason of the fact that his Honour did not take into account the utilitarian value of the plea. (See R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142.) 
      
       
     21 His Honour did refer to the plea, but only in terms of it constituting a “genuine expression of contrition and remorse”. His Honour did not refer in any way to the utilitarian value of the plea. Nor did his Honour provide any quantification of the amount of discount for the plea which he was proposing to allow. 
      
       
     22 In the usual case this Court will be slow to infer that a trial judge has failed to take into account a well-known consideration, merely by reason of a failure to refer to that consideration. However, in this case such an inference, in my opinion, ought to be drawn.  
      
       
     23 As quoted above the trial judge expressly said: “I propose to ameliorate as far as I am able on behalf of the prisoner the sentence that would be required” and “I propose to deal with the matter as leniently as the circumstances permit”. In the light of this general approach which his Honour said he adopted, it appears to me that if he had given the utilitarian value of the plea the full weight that it deserved, which is substantial, there would have been an express reference to that consideration. 
      
       
     24 In my view, the exercise of the sentencing discretion miscarried by reason of his Honour’s failure to take into account this material factor. The discretion falls to be re-exercised by this Court. 
      
       
     25 His Honour indicated that the circumstances of the offence called for a custodial sentence and that it was not an appropriate case in which to suspend such sentence. In this respect his Honour referred to Jurisic, but indicated that he would have come to that view irrespective of the reasoning in Jurisic. His Honour also referred to Dinsdale as quoted above. I agree with his Honour’s conclusion in this respect. 
      
       
     26 The relevant circumstances are set out in his Honour’s judgment and have been briefly summarised above. The subjective circumstances are entitled to particular weight. The tragic circumstances in which the Applicant returned to a course of binge drinking is entitled to sympathy, although it does not excuse his conduct which endangered the public by driving while under the influence.  
      
       
     27 There is also material before this Court that was not available to his Honour. It appears that he is making further progress in prison with respect to his alcohol problem. When he was first placed in custody at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater he was held in Pod 10. He became aware that an inmate in the adjoining pod was the person who had been charged with the murder of his son and he could hear his name being called out from time to time. He said that he found this an extremely stressful experience. In this regard the circumstances of his incarceration were particularly harsh. 
      
       
     28 I agree with his Honour’s conclusion that a term of three years was an appropriate starting point, in all of the circumstances, particularly by reason of the strong subjective case put before the Court. However, I would apply a discount of twenty-five percent to that term by reason of the utilitarian value of the plea. Accordingly, I would replace his Honour’s term of imprisonment with a term of two years and three months. 
      
       
     29 His Honour fixed the non-parole period at fifty percent of the head sentence. It is not clear to me that all of the matters to which his Honour referred constituted special circumstances which justified a variation in the statutory ratio of this degree. Nevertheless, I am not minded to change the proportion bearing in mind the principle of double jeopardy.  
      
       
     30 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1 Grant leave to appeal against sentence and allow the appeal. 
        
        
       2 Quash the sentence imposed by the trial judge and in lieu thereof impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of two years and three months to commence on 10 May 2001 and to expire on 9 August 2003, with a non-parole period of one year, one month and two weeks to expire on 24 June 2002. 
        
        
       3 His Honour’s order that the Respondent be disqualified from holding a licence for a period of three years from 17 May 2001 should be affirmed.

Dismiss appeals against the sentences of the fixed period of 15 months on each of counts one, two and three of the indictment but vary the date of commencement of each such sentence to 24 April 2001 to expire on 23 July 2002. Dismiss the appeal against the sentence imposing a fixed period of imprisonment of three years on the s.51A committal sentence for the offence of assault and act of indecency in September 1984 but vary the date of commencement of such sentence to 24 April 2001 to expire on 23 April 2004. Allow the appeal against the sentences on counts four and five of the indictment. Quash those sentences and in lieu of the sentences imposed, sentence the applicant on each count to imprisonment for seven years commencing on 24 April 2004. Impose a non?parole period in respect of those sentences of three years, eight months commencing that day, that is 24 April 2004 and expiring on 23 December 2007, on which date the applicant is eligible for release on parole.

      REGINA v. ROBERT ELLMORE 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales in consequence of the applicant's committal for sentence under the provisions of s.51A of the Justices Act 1902 and in consequence of the applicant's pleas of guilty on arraignment on additional charges on an indictment. 
      
       
     2 The applicant had pleaded guilty on two different days in the Central Local Court in respect of the matters on which he was committed for sentence to the District Court. He had, in the District Court, entered his plea to the charges on the indictment on 6 December 2001. He was sentenced on 18 January 2002. The trial judge had dated the commencement of the sentences he imposed only from the dates he expressed on the date of their imposition. The applicant had, however, been in custody since 24 April 2001, having been taken into custody for these offences. I will return to the dates on which the sentences were to take effect later in these remarks. 
      
       
     3 The offences for which the applicant came forward for sentence in counts one to three were offences under s.76A of the Crimes Act 1900 of commit an act of indecency on a female under the age of 16 years. The maximum penalty for those offences as prescribed by that section, which has since been repealed, was two years penal servitude. The offences were said to have been committed in or about January 1981. 
      
       
     4 The offences charged in counts four and five of the indictment were offences of aggravated indecent assault said to have been committed between 30 March 2001 and 2 April 2001. Those matters are offences under s.61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which maximum penalties are prescribed of 10 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     5 On the s.51A document an offence was charged of assault and commit an act of indecency on a person under the age of 14 years, the date of the offence being between 1 September 1984 and 30 September 1994. This was an offence under s.61E(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which has also been repealed but which provided for a maximum penalty of six years penal servitude. 
      
       
     6 The trial judge imposed the following sentences: on counts one to three, imprisonment on each count for a fixed period of 15 months, that imprisonment to commence on 18 January 2002, the date of imposition of the sentences, and to expire on 17 April 2003. 
      
       
     7 On counts to four to five, on each count his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment of eight years to commence on 18 January 2005 and to expire on 17 January 2013. On each count his Honour imposed a non-parole period of five years. Although that non-parole period is less than the statutory proportion referred to in s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour did find special circumstances, when regard is had only to the sentence on which it was imposed, since that sentence, as will appear, was cumulative, the total effective non-parole period was only fractionally less than the statutory proportion, having regard to the effective total sentence. I will return to this matter also later. 
      
       
     8 On the s.51A offence his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of three years to commence on 18 January 2002 and to expire on 17 January 2005. That term of imprisonment is therefore to be served concurrently with the imprisonment imposed on counts one to three and the imprisonment imposed on counts four to five is to be entirely cumulative on the sentence passed in relation to the offence contained in the s.51A document. 
      
       
     9 The applicant had, at the time of coming forward for sentence, a substantial record for sexual offences against young females. He had received, in 1999, in the District Court of New South Wales, sentences for indecent assault on young females, which sentences contained an additional term of two years providing for his release subject to supervision. The applicant was thus on parole at the time of the commission of the last two offences to which his Honour referred in his remarks on sentence when he referred to the offences under s.61M, they being the offences embraced in counts four and five. 
      
       
     10 It is not necessary to repeat in detail the specific facts of each of the offences in this judgment. They are set out in his Honour's remarks on sentence. It is sufficient to say that the offences referred to in the committal document arose out of the offender's abuse of trust towards a young girl, then aged 12 at a time when the offender was the rector of an Anglican church. When the young girl had visited his home the offender picked her up and rubbed her against his lap. 
      
       
     11 As to the offences charged on the indictment, three of those offences related to the conduct of the offender towards a 10 year old girl on three consecutive days, again when he was a rector of an Anglican church, in circumstances where he used the pretext of religious education to approach the girl alone. Again he rubbed her on his lap and manually interfered with her. 
      
       
     12 The last two counts, as his Honour referred to them in the indictment, related to the offender's conduct whilst on parole in the year 2001 toward an eight year old girl, he having been a guest overnight, at the invitation of her parents, in their home. That conduct involved manual interference with the young girl. On the day following, the conduct came to light. The parents confronted the applicant and he said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I couldn't help myself, it is a sickness.” 
         
        
       
     13 He apologised to the victim and left the house, was arrested and charged. 
      
       
     14 The trial judge, in passing sentence, turned to some of the subjective features that had been established in the material before him and referred to the applicant as being aged 64 as at the time of sentence, having been born on 10 October 1937. He referred to the applicant having had a family, which has apparently, to a very great extent, severed contact from him. He referred to pre-sentence reports, which detailed the applicant's theological studies and work in the church. He referred to the applicant's offences having resulted in his exclusion from the priesthood. 
      
       
     15 The trial judge summarised the effect of the applicant's previous behaviour and offences by referring to portion of a report provided by Dr. Lennings concerning the applicant being a long term paedophile. That report referred to a 40 year history of persistent sexual deviation with strong paedophile interests in young girls. That conclusion, that the applicant had been a long term paedophile with interests in young girls, was conclusively established by all the material. His Honour reached the view that the risk of re-offending in the applicant's case without appropriate intensive therapeutic intervention was moderately high. However, his Honour also referred to Dr Lennings' report and a psychologist's report emphasising the availability of a long term treatment programme involving a high level of intensive community supervision with a view to successful management of the applicant's problem. 
      
       
     16 The trial judge adverted to the entry of pleas of guilty from the outset, referred to what he accepted was genuine remorse and contrition to some extent and referred specifically to the applicant being himself concerned at his own behaviour and being genuine in his desire to do something about bringing that behaviour under control. 
      
       
     17 On the hearing of this appeal there was tendered, on the basis that reference to it would be appropriate if the court should be minded to re-sentence, a report from Dr. Rob McMurdo, psychiatrist, of 10 April 2002. That report, to which regard might be had in the event of re-sentence, details the extent to which the applicant had been willing to take steps to bring his behaviour under control, even being prepared to resort to castration or chemical castration. It will be a matter to which regard may need to be had on re-sentence that that report contains material the effect of which would seem to overcome the reserve his Honour expressed as to the prospects of the applicant. 
      
       
     18 His Honour was satisfied that there was help and treatment available to the applicant, both in and outside the prison system, and that treatment, if successful, would probably enable him to bring his deviant sexual behaviour under control. His Honour was satisfied of the applicant's genuine willingness to participate in that treatment. 
      
       
     19 His Honour turned then to the gravity of the crimes. He regarded these crimes as extremely serious. That is a view that this court must share. The conduct tended, as his Honour pointed out, to undermine that trust which parents and young children are entitled to have in the institutions of the church. Although his Honour referred to a criminal invasion of the bodies of the three victims, those words should be understood as referring to the manual interference and the rubbing of the victims' bodies upon his body, to which I have already referred. There is no reason to apprehend that his Honour failed to have proper regard to the nature and gravity of the conduct. He expressed the view that the maximum sentence provided by law underestimated the community's abhorrence of this type of conduct, but properly regarded himself as bound to deal with the matters of sentence in accordance with law. 
      
       
     20 He concluded, however, that there should be severe sentences, notwithstanding the applicant's remorse for the reasons set out in a passage in his remarks which I quote:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""You have been defrocked by your former church, but it seems to me that you have only yourself to blame for the position that you now find yourself in. Even though Dr .Lennings, in his report, recognises that the history given to him by you of inter-generated child sexual abuse at the hands of your grandmother and your uncle could have sensitised you to your deviant sexual impulses and so provided you with an opportunity to develop the necessary loss of inhibition against sexually molesting children that is ingrained in everyone in the community. Even if Dr. Lennings' views in this regard are correct, then that fact may go some way to explain why you gave in to or possessed your deviant desires, but it does not go any way towards excusing it. It certainly does not excuse your criminal conduct towards the three young girls in question at any time. In abusing them as you did, as I have previously said, you abused the confidence that they placed in you, you abused the trust they placed in you and you abused the trust their parents placed on you. On two of those occasions the situations occurred while you were a Minister of the Anglican Church. On one of them you abused the trust placed in you by parents who had befriended you, despite your previous conduct of which they were well aware.” 
         
        
       
     21 His Honour referred also to a matter which has been the subject of a particular submission in this court. That is that the applicant's sexual dealings occurred in a context in which he himself had been the victim of sexual abuse. It was submitted to us that regard should have been had to this matter as his Honour does not appear to have so regarded it as such as to mitigate, to some extent, the sentence as should have been imposed. 
      
       
     22 Further, it was submitted that his Honour had failed to have regard at all to the applicant's otherwise good character, his works of assistance and value to the community as expressed, which ought also, so it is submitted, to have been taken into account, at least to some extent, having regard to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Ryan v. The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 815. Both of those matters are matters to which regard should be had in the event that the court is to re-sentence. However, they are in the context, overall, of the sentences that should properly be imposed for offences of this gravity; matters, whilst of significance, that would not of themselves have a substantial bearing on the result. 
      
       
     23 His Honour referred to the applicant as being entitled not only to a utilitarian discount in respect of the early pleas of guilty, but also to an additional discount for the applicant's pleas saving the three victims from reliving the sorry episodes in their lives that gave rise to the offences. His Honour adverted, in addition, to the custodial portion of the applicant's sentences having to be served in protected custody and to that being a more onerous burden. In this court it was submitted that the effect of serving the custodial portions in such a way is to impose a sentence one and a half times or twice as onerous as the ordinary incidence of sentence on an offender. 
      
       
     24 His Honour had regard to the last two offences, that is, the offences under s.61M(2) that were committed whilst the offender was on parole and concluded that he did not think he should backdate the sentence to the date of arrest because the applicant was on parole at the time of the commission of the offences, presumably because his Honour thought that some action in relation to that parole might have a bearing on the incidence of these sentences. His Honour had regard to the principle of totality but concluded that it was necessary to pass cumulative sentences. His Honour did refer to the question of backdate in the context of the Parole Board dealing with the offender for breach and the ordinary expectation that there would be a revocation of parole, something which had not, at the time of the sentencing, occurred. He expressed the view that were there to be a backdate, there would be concurrence between the sentences he was passing and those for which the applicant was on parole and he appears to have concluded that should not occur. 
      
       
     25 When his Honour came to fix the non-parole period he found special circumstances, in particular in the light of the material from the doctor and psychologist about the need for the applicant to undergo a prolonged treatment regime. He expressed the desirability for that regime to commence as soon as possible and particularly in custody. In regard to that finding of special circumstances his Honour had no express regard to the age of the offender at the time of expected release, ie., 72; to the cumulation of the various sentences producing a non-parole period which, in effect, was of eight years duration; or to the fact of the regime for rehabilitation, to which he referred, having to be administered, at least so far as the period in which the offender was in custody, in the context of protection, the more onerous mode of serving a sentence. 
      
       
     26 But his Honour did say that he had discounted the sentences he might otherwise have imposed as a result of the pleas of guilty and the promise to undergo rehabilitation and made reference to the necessity for supervision on parole and the participation in a community based programme. 
      
       
     27 The product, therefore, in overall terms of the sentences imposed by his Honour was a sentence which, in its total effect, extended for 11 years with a non-parole period of eight years from the time from which the sentences were passed and which did not take into account the full time for which the offender would be in custody, which approximated some nine months, that being because of his Honour declining to backdate the sentence. 
      
       
     28 I turn, firstly, to the question of the commencement date of the sentence. The Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides in s.24 that the court must, in sentencing an offender, take into account any time for which the offender has been in custody in relation to the offence. Normally the court will backdate a sentence so that it commences upon the date the offender went into custody for the offence (Regina v. McHugh [1985] 1 NSWLR 588). It has been said that, other than in exceptional circumstances, the court should commence the sentence from the date the accused entered into continuous custody for the offence. See Regina v. English [2000] NSW CCA 245, where emphasis was placed by this court on the ordinary rule. 
      
       
     29 In this case what the trial judge appears to have done is to decline to take into account the period for which the applicant was in custody for these offences when the matter came before him, on the expectation that that custody should be made referable to the earlier offences for which the applicant was then on parole, by the mechanism of the parole board revoking the parole. It has been submitted that that is an error of principle. Against that submission it was urged by the Crown that his Honour was only doing that in the context of his recognising the inevitability of such a course being taken by the Parole Board. I do not regard that as a sufficient answer. In particular what has been done has operated effectively to affect the discretion of the Parole Board. I do not see that this case differs from any other case in which offences have been committed while on parole. It is for the court to pass sentence in accordance with the principles and practices relevant to that exercise rather than seeking to advert to what courses might be taken, applying different considerations, by the Parole Board. 
      
       
     30 In my view the trial judge's discretion to fix the commencement date of the sentence has miscarried and in my view the appropriate commencement date for these sentences as accumulated should be 24 April 2001 in accordance with the ordinary rule. 
      
       
     31 It was further argued that the sentences imposed were affected by error in that the trial judge had failed to take into account that ""otherwise good character"" to which I have referred, had failed to give adequate recognition in the final product of the sentence to matters which should have discounted the sentences imposed sufficiently so that the eight year sentence differed sufficiently from the maximum of 10 years for the offences under s.61M and that the end product of the sentences passed, particularly for those offences, that is to say, eight years as against a maximum 10 years, showed that those matters his Honour had found by way of leniency had not been translated into the calculation of the sentences actually fixed. I agree with that submission. It is patent that his Honour was minded to allow the full extent of discount provided by the decisions of this court for the early pleas. This is particularly appropriate in a case of this sort to encourage pleas for offences of this kind and, as to some of them, of this antiquity, thus discouraging the necessity for the victims to have to come forward. 
      
       
     32 There were a number of matters to which his Honour adverted over and above the utilitarian values of the pleas which should have resulted in a greater discount, but it is not necessary to detail them with particularly. It is sufficient to say that in my view, having regard to the percentages referred to in decisions such as Regina v. Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 that there should have been an overall greater difference between a sentence of eight years and a maximum of 10 years for the s.61M offences. 
      
       
     33 Further his Honour found special circumstances. As I have said, in total effective terms, the non-parole period differed, but little from the statutory proportion. In my view it was necessary for the non-parole period, in these circumstances, to differ by some such significant amount as reflects the special circumstances found. I would conclude that a non-parole period of the order of two-thirds would be appropriate. 
      
       
     34 Having regard to the material tendered before the court today on re-sentence, that is to say the report of Dr. McMurdo, and having regard to all of the circumstances found by his Honour as I have referred to, which in my view did not translate into the final product of sentence, I conclude that the following orders should be made: 
      
       
     35 Leave to appeal against the sentences should be granted. The appeal should be allowed in part. The appeals should be dismissed against the sentences of the fixed period of 15 months on each of counts one, two and three of the indictment but vary the date of commencement of each such sentence to 24 April 2001 to expire on 23 July 2002. Dismiss the appeal against the sentence imposing a fixed period of imprisonment of three years on the s.51A committal sentence for the offence of assault and act of indecency in September 1984 but vary the date of commencement of such sentence to 24 April 2001 to expire on 23 April 2004. Allow the appeal against the sentences on counts four and five of the indictment. Quash those sentences and in lieu of the sentences imposed, sentence the applicant on each count to imprisonment for seven years commencing on 24 April 2004. Impose a non-parole period in respect of those sentences of three years, eight months commencing that day, that is 24 April 2004 and expiring on 23 December 2007, on which date the applicant is eligible for release on parole. 
      
       
     36 SMART, AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     37 GREG JAMES, J: The sentences will therefore be as I have proposed and the orders on appeal as I have proposed.

     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I invite Blanch AJ to deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 BLANCH J: This is a Crown appeal brought against a sentence imposed at Parramatta District Court on 15 February, 2002. On that day the respondent was sentenced on two charges of robbery contrary to s94 Crimes Act, 1900 which specifies a maximum penalty of fourteen years. In addition there were two matters on a Form 1, one being an offence of robbery and the other being an offence of demand money with intent to steal. On each count, the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for three years and two months to commence on 1 November, 2000 and a non-parole period of two years was specified to expire on 31 October, 2002.3 The first offence on the indictment related to a robbery on Saturday, 28 October, 2000 at the TAB agency at Ashfield. At 9.30 p.m. the respondent went into the agency and approached Ms Richards who was working there and said “Give me your fucking money”. The victim then triggered an alarm and the respondent shook his head and said “What did you do that for?” and the victim then handed the respondent money from the till. He lifted up his T-shirt and she thought she saw a black gun under the T-shirt.4 The second offence related to a robbery on 31 October, 2000 when the respondent went to the Blockbuster video shop at Enmore at 2.30 p.m. He said to Heidi Martin, who worked in the shop “…I’ve got a gun in my jacket” and he then told the two women in the shop to get the till out. The money from the till was put in a plastic bag and he heard a siren. He said he didn’t care if the police came and asked them for an ice cream, which he took from a refrigerator nearby and then walked out of the shop with $350 taken from the till.5 The two Form 1 matters both related to the Enmore TAB agency. The first was at 8.10 p.m. on 7 October, 2000 when he walked into the agency and said he had a gun and demanded money from the till. He decamped with $764. The second matter on the Form 1 was on the same TAB agency at 2.30 p.m. on 31 October, 2000. This time he encountered a Mr. Palombi in the agency. He recognised the respondent because he had been robbed by him in similar circumstances on three previous occasions. There was some discussion between them and the respondent said “I suppose you’ve hit the button by now, in that case you’d better give me the money”. Mr Palombi refused and the respondent said: “Do you want me to pull out the gun?” Mr Palombi walked away from the counter and the respondent walked out of the shop.6 The respondent is 44 years of age. He has a criminal history dating back to 1972. He was sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment for dishonesty offences in Sydney District Court in 1976. In 1980 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for three robbery offences. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment for dishonesty offences in the Local Court in 1984. He was sentenced to eight years penal servitude for dishonesty and violence offences in 1989. In 1993, for seven robbery offences, he was sentenced to five years imprisonment and in 1999, he was sentenced to five years imprisonment for robbery offences at Sydney District Court. In addition to those sentences, he has been sentenced to a number of other shorter periods of imprisonment. On 2 November, 2000, which was the day after his arrest on these matters, his parole was revoked, leaving him with a sentence of one year eight months and nineteen days imprisonment from 1 November, 2000. He was on parole at the time these offences were committed, having been released from custody on 20 July, 2000.7 A number of reports were tendered relating to the respondent. A report from Duffy, Barrier and Robilliard, psychologists dated 21 January, 2001 states he is an Aboriginal man born in Cowra. He is married with a thirteen year old son. He told the psychologist he has been in gaol for all but eight months of his son’s life. He reported an extensive drug abuse history from his mid-teens and prior to his arrest, he was injecting heroin at a cost of about $150 a day, as well as using cocaine and cannabis. The psychologist report diagnosed his major problems as drug dependency and depression but expressed the view he “may benefit” from a shorter sentence with a lengthier term of supervision. An Official Visitor at the gaol, Dr. Simon Hasleton, has spoken to the respondent on a number of occasions and noted his desire to go into the William Booth Rehabilitation Programme. He concluded “Almost in the teeth of his history, I have a strong feeling that Alex Christian has a chance of putting his life in order…”. Dr. John Daniels, the Director of Health Services at the Aboriginal Medical Service Co-operative Limited, has treated the respondent for the past three years. He says he has a chronic depressive illness which is now responding to new medication. He says the respondent has made “impressive progress”. He went on to say the respondent had given significant assistance as the Aboriginal delegate at the gaol and “It is my opinion that the evident changes in Mr. Christian are highly suggestive of that very kind of permanent change which is indicative of a low risk of the circumstances which may lead to re-offending behaviour.”8 The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge has three unusual characteristics. Firstly, the sentences are backdated to the date the respondent commenced serving the balance of his parole, namely 1 November, 2000 rather than the date of sentence, namely 15 February, 2002. Secondly, although the judge said the matters on the Form 1 called for a higher penalty, she did not specify which was the charge in respect of which she took them into account. Thirdly, she imposed exactly the same sentence on each count and made the sentences concurrent.9 Her Honour expressed some difficulty in determining an appropriate sentence, bearing in mind the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 relates to armed robbery offences and these were not offences involving being armed. By the same token, the offences are robbery offences and each of them carries a significant maximum term of imprisonment. Of particular note in this case is the fact that the prisoner was on parole in respect of the robbery offences at the time these offences were committed. He had been released to parole just over two months before the first offence was committed. By backdating the sentence for these offences to the date on which his revocation of parole took effect, the sentencing judge was giving to him a very significant discount on these sentences. In my view, the fact that offences are committed while on parole is not a basis for reducing the sentence, it is more often a basis for not reducing the appropriate sentence. Of course, there was a long delay in these sentences occurring and no doubt that had to do with the difficulties the Aboriginal Legal Service had in obtaining the necessary reports and negotiating an appropriate indictment with the Crown. The respondent should not be penalised for that.10 The failure to specify which of the sentences was to reflect the matters on the Form 1 makes it difficult to understand the method of sentencing and that will need to be addressed. 11 In my view, the overall sentence imposed here is manifestly inadequate and accordingly, I would allow the Crown appeal.  
      
       
     12 Having reached that stage in the deliberations of this Court, it then becomes necessary to look at the exercise of the discretion as to what sentence should be imposed, bearing in mind a number of significant factors. One troubling factor in this case is the delay since the time the prisoner went into custody. He has been in gaol since 1 November, 2000 and he is presently due for consideration for release to parole on 31 October, 2002. As I have indicated, the reasons for the delay no doubt have much to do with the difficulties in preparing his case and the negotiations which proceeded between the defence and the Crown. At the end of the day, the Crown has accepted that it is appropriate for him to plead guilty to offences of robbery, rather than armed robbery. That concession was made by the Crown apparently after the trial at Parramatta began. Again, the respondent is not to be penalised for that delay. 
      
       
     13 He was, of course, sentenced on 15 February, 2002 and the Crown appeal was lodged on 18 April, 2002. Since 15 February, he has been contemplating 31 October, 2002 as a possible release date, and, of course, the prison authorities would have been, as we have been informed, working towards that release date.  
      
       
     14 Another factor to consider in what this Court does in imposing sentence is the fact that although these are robbery offences, and therefore, serious, the nature of them does not disclose that the prisoner is an adept professional criminal. 
      
       
     15 A further matter that needs to be considered is the further evidence that has now been tendered before us from Dr. Daniels. A substantial argument which was submitted to the sentencing judge was that this prisoner had reached the cross roads within the well-known meaning of that phrase, as expressed in R v Osenkowski (1982) 5 A Crim R 394. Bearing in mind the history of the prisoner’s imprisonment in the past, this Court would be justified in being somewhat doubtful as to whether or not the cross roads had been reached. On the other hand, there is some significant and uncontradicted material coming from the gaol which says that the prisoner has reached that cross roads and has, as it were, seen the light. In particular, in the report of Dr. Daniels, he says that the respondent’s offences “…were committed at a time when he didn’t have access to the antidepressant medication Sertraline (Zoloft)…” He went on to say that the depressive illness the respondent had was untreated at the time of the offences and, no doubt, had some significant part to play in his offending behaviour. In his further report he goes on to say “I would especially re-emphasise that Mr. Christian has undergone significant transformation and that he now has the requisite personal qualities to combat any previous tendency towards recidivism.” 
      
       
     16 Bearing in mind all of those factors and, of course, the fact that this is a Crown appeal involving considerations of double jeopardy, the course that I would propose is a course which ordinarily would not be open, bearing in mind the objective seriousness of the offences committed as they were on parole. However, I believe, bearing in mind these other matters that I have referred to, the course I propose is appropriate. 
      
       
     17 I would allow the Crown appeal and quash the sentences imposed below. On the first count and taking into account the two matters on the Form 1, I would impose a sentence of four years to date from 1 November, 2000 and specify a non-parole period of two years to expire on 31 October, 2002. On the second count, I would impose a sentence of three years and two months to date from 1 November, 2000 and fix a non-parole period of two years to expire on 31 October, 2002. Those sentences, of course, would be concurrent. 
      
       
     18 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree.19 SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
      
       
     20 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are as indicated by Blanch AJ.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a Crown appeal against the alleged inadequacy of a sentence imposed by her Honour Tupman DCJ. The Respondent pleaded guilty to one count of robbery armed with an offensive weapon, namely a blood-filled syringe, contrary to s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, and a second count of attempted armed robbery with an offensive weapon, namely a mock rifle, contrary to s344A of the Crimes Act 1900. Two additional charges were asked to be taken into account on a Form 1, namely, demanding of money with menaces and another armed robbery. 
      
       
     2 The relevant events occurred over a short period of time. The first count on the indictment, being the armed robbery, occurred at about 12.30pm on 4 February 2001. The Respondent entered a shop in Ashbury operated by Meiya Gao and her husband Ping Li. The Respondent produced a syringe filled with blood and demanded money. Ms Gao threw an envelope containing $150 at the Respondent and the Respondent left with the money. After the offence, Ms Gao placed a length of aluminium rod behind the counter of the shop. 
      
       
     3 The first offence to be taken into account on the Form 1 took place on the following day, that is 5 February 2001. The Respondent again entered the shop of Ms Gao and demanded money. She hit the counter several times with the aluminium rod and refused to hand over money to the Respondent, who left the shop. 
      
       
     4 The second offence on the indictment, namely the attempted armed robbery, occurred on 12 February 2001. While a co-offender stood by the doorway, the Respondent again entered the shop of Ms Gao and Mr Li carrying what appeared to be a rifle, which was in fact a length of pipe and timber, covered by a piece of cloth or jacket. He demanded money from Mr Li. Ms Gao recognised the Respondent and, although she believed the Respondent was armed, she formed the belief that the weapon could not be fired. She pushed passed Mr Li and threw a stool at the Respondent. When the Respondent attempted to reach into the till, she struck the counter with the aluminium rod several times. The Respondent and the co-offender left the shop without taking any property. 
      
       
     5 The second offence on the Form 1 took place about thirty minutes after the above incident on 12 February 2001. The Respondent entered a shop at Croydon operated by Jie Zheng. The Respondent was carrying an object that he said was a gun, demanded money and cigarettes from Ms Zheng. The victim, believing it to be a gun, handed the Respondent $200 and some cigarettes. The Respondent left in a car identified by witnesses. It belonged to the Respondent’s parents. On 13 February 2001, police officers arrested the Respondent and co-offender. The Respondent admitted his part in the offences of 12 February and said that he was attempting to obtain money for the purpose of acquiring drugs. His recollection of the events of 4 and 5 February was vague. 
      
       
     6 Of significance when her Honour came to sentence the Respondent, was the fact that he had spent about seven months in custody. When he was arrested on 13 February 2001, he remained in custody, bail refused. There was considerable delay in bringing him to trial, occasioned in large measure by the issue of his fitness to plead. In the event, he remained in custody until 6 October 2001, when bail was granted in the District Court on strict terms, including the offender attending for psychiatric treatment. 
      
       
     7 As soon as the issue of fitness to plead had been resolved, the Respondent indicated that he would be pleading guilty. 
      
       
     8 In her remarks on sentence, Tupman DCJ referred to the seriousness of the offences and to the fact that the offences carried maximum penalties of twenty years and ten years respectively. She noted that the victims of the four offences were in vulnerable positions as shopkeepers of small shops. She noted that although there were threats involved in the production of weapons, there was no actual violence involved. Her Honour did not, however, refer to the particular sense of horror occasioned by production of a blood-filled syringe (see for example R v Kyroglou and Tsoukatos [1999] NSWCCA 106 at 88 per Simpson J, and see also R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at 17 and 72). Her Honour referred to R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and identified it as a “useful starting point” for determination of the appropriate penalty. Her Honour emphasised one particularly significant factor for the present case, the serious mental illness suffered by the Respondent. 
      
       
     9 Her Honour outlined the personal history and family background of the Respondent. She noted aspects of delusional conduct when he was very young and the increased abnormality of his behaviour from the age of sixteen. From that age he experimented with drugs including marijuana, LSD, amphetamines and eventually cocaine, ecstasy and heroin. At the time when he committed the offences in February 2001, he was using heroin and cocaine everyday. Tupman DCJ made the following findings: 
      
       
        
         
         “In about the four year period before these offences were committed, he had started to develop serious and noticeable psychotic symptoms, including auditory hallucinations in which he heard people telling him to do bad things. He started to laugh and talk to himself and draw what are described as hideous pictures. Just before he committed these offences he had abruptly left the home in which he lived with his parents and had stolen his mother’s car. They had reported him as missing to police but did not discover his whereabouts until ultimately they were informed that he had been arrested and charged in relation to these offences. 
         
        
        
         
         The offender had had frequent contact with Mental Health Services and several admissions to psychiatric hospitals before his arrest on this occasion. About four years ago he was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia during one of these episodes. … He has in the past been admitted to the McKinnon Ward at Rozelle Hospital for drug related problems and his psychosis, and has been committed to a locked up ward because of attempts to escape from the psychiatric hospital. After he was arrested in relation to these offences and was in custody in April 2001 and in circumstances where, I accept, he was not at that stage actually using illicit drugs, he was exhibiting floridly psychotic symptoms to psychiatric treaters within the Corrective Services Department. He was described as delusional and thought disordered at that stage. I accept the opinion of Dr Teoh, the psychiatrist, that, at the time he committed these offences, the offender was grossly thought disordered, incoherent and disorganised. I accept that his mental condition played a significant part in his having committed these offences in that his judgment was severely affected because of it.” 
         
        
       
     10 Her Honour went on to note the psychiatric treatment he received, particularly since his release on bail. Her Honour also accepted that he was suffering from clinical depression at the time he was released on bail. Tupman DCJ concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “I accept that the offender suffers from a mental illness, namely at the least, substance induced psychosis and mood disorder. I accept that it is also likely that he suffers an underlying psychotic disorder, either schizophrenia or bi-polar mood disorder which had started to emerge before he commenced abusing illicit drugs and which was in evidence to an extent while he was in gaol not using drugs in April 2001. 
         
        
        
         
         Since he has been released on bail and has been following the intensive medical treatment organised for him by his parents, his mood has stabilised, he is no longer exhibiting psychotic symptoms, he has developed insight into his mental illness and its connection with his commission of these offences and I accept that he is motivated to keep both his mental illness and his use of illicit drugs under control. He is undertaking meaningful employment, is living with his parents in the community and appears to be contributing as a useful member of the community. He is making good progress in relation to his ongoing drug and alcohol counselling. 
         
        
        
         
         The offender has the benefit of a supportive family and his rehabilitation will be assisted by that.” 
         
        
       
     11 Her Honour concluded that the Respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation were good, provided that his treatment remains in place. She noted that although such treatment had failed in the past, on this occasion it was more intensive in nature and his parents had taken over the supervision of the treatment to a significant extent. 
      
       
     12 Her Honour noted that the co-offender was sentenced for the two offences in which he was involved on 12 February. After pleading guilty, the co-offender received a sentence of three years and four months, with a non-parole period of twenty-two months. Her Honour referred to the factors differentiating the two cases on the issue of parity. She noted the less serious nature of some aspects of the co-offender’s conduct, but indicated that the major differentiation between the two was the Respondent’s “very significant and serious mental illness at the time he committed these offences and the large part that it played in his commission of them”. Upon that basis his position was to be assessed quite differently from that of his co-offender, particularly, her Honour said, because the issue of general deterrence has to be viewed differently. 
      
       
     13 Her Honour referred again to the Henry guideline of four to five years and indicated that in her view that level was too high in the circumstances of this case by reason of the mental illness of the Respondent. Her Honour identified as a starting point a term of imprisonment of three years as appropriate in the absence of an early plea of guilty. She noted the Henry guideline had taken into account a plea of limited significance. She identified the plea in this case as occurring at the earliest opportunity, entitling the Respondent to a discount of twenty-five percent. On that basis, she reduced the tentative sentence of three years by six months. She then noted that the prisoner had already served six months and three weeks in custody and, accordingly, determined a term of imprisonment of two years, taking into account the time he had actually served in custody. This was the sentence she imposed on each of the two offences. 
      
       
     14 Her Honour then concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “I propose to suspend the whole of those terms of imprisonment in relation to each charge to take into account what I consider to be the remarkable rehabilitation displayed by the prisoner since his release on bail on 6 September 2001. 
         
        
        
         
         It seems to me that his prospects of rehabilitation and the benefit that flows to the community can only be properly affected by his being available to continue in the community the intensive psychiatric and psychological treatment that he has undertaken since his release on bail on 6 September 2001. If that course is to continue, I consider that his prospects of rehabilitation are excellent and the community’s wider interests are best served by having him in the community, drug free and with his mental illness under control and thus, in those circumstances, significantly less likely to commit any further offences.” 
         
        
       
     15 Her Honour suspended the sentence upon the Respondent entering a bond on certain nominated conditions. 
      
       
     16 Her Honour had earlier rejected the submission that it would be appropriate in this case to impose a sentence, subject to an order for home detention. She rejected that course because the sentence she believed was appropriate was in excess of eighteen months and, on that basis, an order that the sentence be served by way of home detention was not available under s7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (1999). A sentence of imprisonment may only be suspended pursuant to s12 of that Act, if it is for a term of not more than two years. That is precisely the term that her Honour imposed. 
      
       
     17 In submissions to this Court, the Crown asserted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. It submitted that some aspects of the conduct in the present case indicated a higher level of seriousness than the matters considered to constitute a typical case referred to in Henry: the Respondent at twenty-six was not a young offender and the blood-filled syringe was an aggravating circumstance. These are pertinent elements which is why the Henry starting point was expressed as a range. Other elements are, however, low in the scale, for example the limited amount of fear induced in the victims. In my opinion, her Honour was entitled to adopt the Henry guide as a starting point. 
      
       
     18 Her Honour was entitled to take into account the mental illness from which the Respondent suffered. The Crown accepted that her Honour was entitled to give less weight to the question of general deterrence, by reason of his condition. The Crown submission was that her Honour had given this consideration excessive weight by reducing the starting point to three years. The Crown submitted that a period of imprisonment of four to five years was the appropriate sentence on the facts of this case. It submitted that the excessive weight her Honour gave to the subjective considerations, including the prospects of rehabilitation, led to inadequate weight being given to the objective circumstances of the case. 
      
       
     19 As I said in Henry at [169]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the range, as this Court’s prior decisions indicate. The narrow range is a starting point.” 
         
        
        
       This is how her Honour approached the issues. She was, in my opinion, entitled to do so. 
        
       
     20 There can be no doubt that the requirement of general deterrence is a significant consideration in sentencing for the offence of armed robbery. There is a long-standing body of case law in this Court to the effect that a non-custodial sentence for this offence can only be imposed in exceptional circumstances. However, this Court has upheld findings of that character by trial judges. (See the cases considered in Henry supra at [113]-[119].) 
      
       
     21 The significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercised has long been accepted. The relevant authorities have been reviewed in this Court, the Victorian Court of Appeal and the Western Australian Full Court. See R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48] per Simpson J; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45] per Smart AJ; see also R v Lauritsen (2000) 114 A Crim R 333, esp [43]-[51] per Malcolm CJ; R v Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; see also Potas, Sentencing Manual: Law Principles and Practice in New South Wales 2001 at 285-286; Fox and Freiberg, Sentencing State and Federal Law in Victoria (2nd ed), 1999 at 293-294. 
      
       
     22 In the present case, the Crown was prepared to concede that some mitigation was appropriate, on the basis of giving less weight to the issue of general deterrence. However, that is not the only way in which mental illness impinges on the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
      
       
     23 To the extent that mental illness explains the offence – as her Honour found to be the position in the present case – then an offender’s inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law. As Wood CJ at CL put it in Henry, supra, at [254]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing.” 
         
        
       
     24 I agree with the observations of Malcolm CJ in Lauritsen at [48]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but it is also relevant to assessing the level of danger the offender presents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated. The mental illness should be taken into account in sentencing whether or not it played a part in the commission of the offence, but not with the consequence of the imposition of a sentence which exceeds the seriousness of the offence.” 
         
        
       
     25 Furthermore, mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence, not just general deterrence, is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise than it may otherwise have because, as the Victorian Court of Appeal put it: 
      
       
        
         
         “… specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such.” ( 
         Tsiaras,  
         supra, at 400) 
         
        
       
     26 Finally, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person and that may be a material consideration in determining the length of the sentence to be served. (See Tsiaras, supra, at 400). However in Lauritsen at [51], Malcolm CJ noted that this factor, identified by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Tsiaras, may not represent the law in Western Australia. It is unnecessary to determine whether this is the law in New South Wales. It appears to have been regarded as material in this Court in R v Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [25]. I see no reason why this would not be so, but the matter was not fully argued. 
      
       
     27 Difficulties arise where there is an element of congruence of drug addiction and mental illness, in separating the effect of mental illness, see e.g. R v Alexander (2000) 118 A Crim R 350, esp at [41]-[45]; R v Pavlov [2001] NSWCCA 13 at [46]-[47]. 
      
       
     28 Her Honour made a number of findings of fact in this regard that I have set out above. She identified the mental illness as a relevant factor, both in terms of culpability and also in terms of rehabilitation. These findings were, in my opinion, open to her Honour. The mental illness involved in the present case was of a particularly high order and gave rise to issues of culpability, personal deterrence and general deterrence, as well as rehabilitation. In these circumstances, in my opinion, it was open to her Honour to conclude that a term of imprisonment of two years was appropriate. 
      
       
     29 Her Honour suspended the sentence on the basis of the significance of rehabilitation in the context of the Respondent’s mental illness. The Crown’s primary submission on this appeal was that the period of two years was manifestly inadequate. If that was so, then suspension would not have been an option for her Honour. The Crown did not make any substantive submission suggesting that, if two years were an appropriate sentence, then suspension was, in all circumstances, inappropriate. This is not a case in which anything appears on the face of the record which suggests that her Honour chose the period of two years by reason of a determination that the offender should not be returned to full-time custody (cf R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [35]-[36]). 
      
       
     30 In my opinion, her Honour’s sentence was within the range of permissible exercise of discretion. The appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     31 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
      
       
     32 BLANCH J: I also agree. 
      
       
     33 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is the appeal be dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Dunford J: This is an application by Matthew Bruce Crowe for leave to appeal against the sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years imposed on him by Dodd DCJ in the District Court at Sydney following his plea of guilty on arraignment to a charge of aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(2) the Crimes Act 1900, which offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     2 In sentencing the applicant his Honour also took into account a further offence on a Form 1, namely possession of a prohibited drug, to wit a small amount of cannabis. 
      
       
     3 The facts of the matters briefly are that at about 7.30 p.m. on Thursday, 8 February 2001, two men, including the applicant approached the front door of Bvlgari Jewellers at 75 Castlereagh Street, Sydney which store retails mainly expensive watches, necklaces, bracelets and other jewellery. The other man was armed with a sledge hammer and both had their faces disguised by various types of clothing. The front glass door to the store was closed but the co-offender smashed it in with the sledge hammer. 
      
       
     4 They both then entered the store through the smashed door and approached the staff wielding the sledge hammer. The staff then either were in, or ran to, the rear of the store where they locked themselves in the office. 
      
       
     5 The applicant and his co-offender then ransacked the store, stealing numerous jewellery items and damaging a number of display cabinets. They approached the rear door leading to the office which they attempted to force open by kicking it and calling out to the persons inside the office demanding that the staff open the safe. 
      
       
     6 The staff did not open the door and the burglars did not gain access to the office area or the safe. They then attempted to leave the store with the stolen jewellery items valued at approximately $750,000 leaving glass and jewellery strewn over the floor and a screwdriver on the floor near one of the display cases indicating that they had come prepared to gain access to such display cases. 
      
       
     7 They then realised that they had been locked in the store as the front door had closed behind them on entry so, using the sledge hammer, the co-offender smashed a further hole in the front glass door. They jumped through the hole in the glass door and entered a stolen motor vehicle which was waiting outside driven by a third offender, which vehicle then left the area at high speed. 
      
       
     8 Two weeks later on Thursday, 22 February at 7.30 p.m. police followed the applicant together with two other persons from Glebe to Parramatta Road in Strathfield at which time the applicant was driving a vehicle registered to his father. The vehicle was stopped, police searched the vehicle, and the applicant's sister was searched and found to be in possession of a $60,000 white gold and diamond necklace confirmed to have been stolen from the Bvlgari store on 8 February. 
      
       
     9 The necklace was quite unique and had an identification tag attachment. The applicant, his sister, and the other occupant of the vehicle were then conveyed to Burwood Police Station where the applicant, as was his right, declined to be interviewed. 
      
       
     10 One of the employees of the store said she was particularly terrified and feared for her life, and had trouble sleeping for several days. 
      
       
     11 The applicant has been in custody since his arrest on 22 February 2001. 
      
       
     12 He was born on 8 December 1976, and was aged 24 at the time of the offence. 
      
       
     13 He has previous convictions extending back to 1995 including six counts of stealing and three of attempted stealing at Wyong Local Court on 7 April 1995, and convictions for malicious damage and larceny at the Downing Centre Local Court on 6 June 1996 arising from an occasion when he smashed a car window and stole a mobile phone from inside the car. 
      
       
     14 On 21 July 2000 he was convicted of being an accessory after the fact to robbery, when $824 had been stolen from the Hunters Hill post office, the robber being armed with a screwdriver. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months from 10 June 2000 with a 6 month non-parole period. He was released on parole on 8 December 2000, and remained on parole at the time of the commission of this offence. 
      
       
     15 Although his parents separated in 1999 he remained close to both of them, particularly his father with whom he lived, as did his two sisters, one of whom he involved in his criminal activity, and who was subsequently charged with receiving the necklace. 
      
       
     16 After his release from prison, his father gave up his previous longstanding employment and set up a lawn mowing business, primarily to provide the applicant with employment along with some supervision and support. 
      
       
     17 The applicant had left school at age 17 having completed his Higher School Certificate, and since then had had a number of jobs over the intervening 8 years which included approximately 2 years of unemployment. 
      
       
     18 Apart from his parents separation to which I have already referred, and with both of whom he remained close, there was no evidence of any family, social or financial deprivation, and no drug problem, although his father said in evidence on the sentence proceedings that after leaving school he associated with undesirable companions, and the police Facts Sheet described him as an associate of the criminal element. 
      
       
     19 It was suggested that the offence was committed because he had been asked to mind $10,000 by a friend, and he spent a part of it and gambled the rest in an effort to recover what had been spent. 
      
       
     20 He told his father that he had only got $10,000 out of the proceedings of this burglary although there was a legally intercepted telephone call on 17 February in which he made comments suggesting that he had received about $20,000. 
      
       
     21 His Probation Officer in the Pre-Sentence Report and learned sentencing judge were both very skeptical of this story, unsupported by any evidence from the applicant, the friend, or anyone who saw him gambling, and with no details of when or where he lost the money. 
      
       
     22 His father gave evidence that the applicant had told him he was minding some cash for a friend, but also said that since his release from prison he had kept an eye on the applicant who only went out with his girlfriend and with his father to the hotel on Saturday afternoon where he would have a few bets totalling $50 to $60 per week. 
      
       
     23 In relation to this his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Your father has confirmed that you told him you were minding some cash for a friend. If it were not for your father's evidence I would have great difficulty as did the author of the Pre-Sentence Report, in accepting this unlikely story, but in any event it does not matter in terms of this sentencing exercise and cannot provide any kind of excuse.” 
         
        
        
       I agree with his Honour's comments.  
        
       
     24 This was a most serious offence. Unlike most offences of this nature, it was not a case of breaking into someone's dwelling house when such person was expected to be absent or asleep and stealing such items as were readily removable such as television sets, videos, cash, personal jewellery et cetera, which might be sold at the local hotel or elsewhere to purchase drugs to feed a habit or addiction; but it was a well planned attack on a jewellery store in the Central Business District of Sydney at a time when the store would be free of customers, it being just after closing time, but the jewellery, would still be in display cases and cabinets, and access could hopefully be had to the safe. This must have involved preparation, surveillance, timing and co-ordination. 
      
       
     25 The applicant and his co-offender were clothed so as to be unidentifiable by facial recognition and armed with necessary implements, the sledge hammer and the screwdriver for the front door and display cabinets. In addition another accomplice was waiting outside in a stolen vehicle to effect a speedy getaway. 
      
       
     26 All this resulted in a theft of almost three-quarters of a million dollars worth of jewellery, very little of which has been recovered, and a trail of wanton damage throughout the store.  
      
       
     27 It was submitted that the learned sentencing judge erred in characterising it as the result of professional planning organisation and execution. In my view he made no such error. The planning was detailed and sophisticated. The organisation as to location, timing and getaway was extensive and the execution was so efficient that no arrests were made for two weeks, and it appears that the co-offenders in the burglary have not been caught at all. As far as the evidence shows, only one necklace that was worn by the applicant's sister at the time of their arrest has been recovered. 
      
       
     28 In his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour took as a starting point the guideline judgment of this court in Re Attorney-General's Application (No 1); R v Pomfield & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 43, 48 NSWLR 327, and noted the various aggravating features referred to in para [48]. 
      
       
     29 He then considered matters in mitigation including the plea of guilty, the question of remorse, special circumstances, prospects of rehabilitation, statistics kept by the Judicial Commission and concluded that the case fell towards the upper end of seriousness for such offences. 
      
       
     30 Four particular grounds of appeal have been argued.  
      
       
       Firstly, it was submitted that his Honour gave insufficient weight to the plea of guilty.  
        
       
     31 In relation to this his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""As against that, clear matters in mitigation are your early plea, and I intend to take that into account fully under the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Thomson to the extent of 25 per cent discount. It has been submitted on your behalf that the Crown might not otherwise have a strong case. I am not certain of that, but in any event I give you the full benefit of the available discount. It is put on your behalf that I should accept that you have become remorseful, that you have expressed a change in attitude, and that you have matured. The evidence of any of that is extremely thin. As I have said before, I am not satisfied that you have, in fact, come to a position where you are genuinely remorseful, or that your attitude has changed so that you are unlikely to commit such crimes in the future, or that you have matured in any way.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     32 It is submitted the effect of what his Honour did was to allow 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea and nothing for contrition or remorse which was necessarily involved in the plea of guilty because it was submitted, as I say, that the Crown case was not particularly strong, and so the plea was not merely a case of bowing to the inevitable. Although his Honour referred to the “early plea”, R v Thomson, and the “full benefit of the discount” in arriving at a discount of 25 per cent for the plea of guilty, this was not a plea at the earliest possible time, and the utilitarian value of the plea did not justify a discount of 25 per cent which Thomson described as a maximum for the utilitarian value for such plea, to be confined to cases where such plea is entered at the earliest possible time, and is generally not appropriate where entered after the case has been set down for trial. 
      
       
     33 This plea was not entered at the earliest possible time, but only after committal and on arraignment, and it appears that the matter was mentioned on at least three occasions in the District Court prior to the plea being entered. And on at least some of those mentions the indication was that the matter would proceed to trial.  
      
       
     34 I would therefore regard the discount of 25 per cent as including all elements of the plea of guilty, not only to the utilitarian value. If it was limited to the utilitarian value it bespeaks error, and would need to be re-assessed. 
      
       
     35 In any event his Honour was not satisfied that the applicant showed contrition or remorse, neither was the person who prepared the Pre-Sentence Report, and neither am I. 
      
       
     36 The only evidence of remorse came in the form of hearsay evidence from his father who said that his son told him he was remorseful because he had let his father down, and also himself, and later after 11 September 2001 he said he thought of the people in the shop. 
      
       
     37 Later his solicitor asked the father a leading question which can fairly be described as a ""Dorothy Dixer"" as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Would you say that he regrets what he did as far as this offence is concerned not for himself but for the people in the store?""  
         
        
       
     38 To which the father replied: 
      
       
        
         
         ""I think for the people in the store and himself, and his family and everyone. ...” 
         
        
       
     39 This testimony was, in my opinion, worthless as evidence of remorse and contrition. If the applicant was genuinely contrite or remorseful it was up to him to give sworn evidence himself on the sentence proceedings, and be subject to cross-examination, disclosing the true details of his involvement in the offence, what became of the property stolen, and so far as possible, where and how it might be recovered. 
      
       
     40 In R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353, both Spigelman CJ and Smart AJ indicated that offenders who, instead of giving evidence themselves on sentence rely on self-serving hearsay statements made to experts should expect that such evidence will be given little weight, and in my view the same applies to similar hearsay evidence given through parents or relatives. 
      
       
     41 In the present case his Honour was not satisfied that the applicant was genuinely contrite or remorseful, or that his plea of guilty was motivated by such contrition or by remorse. Neither am I. Accordingly, I consider the discount of 25 per cent not inappropriate for all elements relevant to the plea of guilty, including the fact that the Crown case, although not weak was not overwhelming. 
      
       
     42 The second ground of appeal is that his Honour erred by characterising the offence as professional. 
      
       
       I have already dealt with the matters relevant to this submission. 
        
       
     43 The third ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances.  
      
       
       It was submitted that as the applicant was on parole after a short period of imprisonment and committed the offence because of a gambling problem and also admitted to the Probation Service that he was smoking cannabis on an average every second day, he is going to need special and intensive supervision following his custody with particular rehabilitation measures such as gambling counselling, drug counselling, guidance as to employment and other general life skills. 
        
       
     44 But the applicant indicated to the author of the Pre-Sentence Report that he did not regard his gambling and cannabis use as problematic, and there was no evidence led of him in fact having a cannabis or gambling addiction. The only evidence on these issues was what was in the Pre-Sentence Report, and the evidence of his father who dismissed any drug or gambling problem. 
      
       
     45 As to employment guidance, his father was employing him before he committed this offence in the circumstances I have already referred to, and gave evidence that he was prepared to continue to employ him. 
      
       
     46 Furthermore, the period of 18 months during which he is eligible to be released on parole should, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, be sufficient for such rehabilitation measures as may be necessary. 
      
       
     47 Parliament has expressed an intention that the non-parole period should generally, that is in the absence of special circumstances, be 75 per cent of the head sentence: s 44 (2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, Spigelman CJ with whom other members of the Court agreed, said at [69]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Section 44 of the 1999 Act, like s 5 of the 1989 (Sentencing) Act operates as a fetter or constraint on the exercise of the sentencing discretion. It operates to guide the discretion in a particular manner.” 
         
        
       and as to whether in a particular case there are special circumstances, his Honour said, at [73]: 
        
         
         “The decision is first one of fact - to identify the circumstances - and, secondly one of judgment - to determine if those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     48 His Honour found no circumstances which he regarded as justifying a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence, than that referred to in s 44 (2), and I can see no error in his Honour's approach. When he was last sentenced in 2000, the proportion was varied, presumably on the ground that a longer period on non-parole period would facilitate the applicant’s rehabilitation. 
      
       
     49 It did not, he merely graduated to a more serious offence; and there is no reason to believe that varying the proportion in this case will have any effect in this case on his rehabilitation this time. 
      
       
     50 Indeed if the non-parole period had not been shortened on the last occasion, he would not have committed this offence as he would have not been out of gaol at the time the offence was committed. 
      
       
     51 The fourth ground of appeal was that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
       It was submitted that although the sentence 
         
       of 6 years imprisonment; or the “starting point” of 6 years whilst within the range of sentence available for this type of offence, is towards the top thereof, and that the top of the range should be reserved for truly organised criminals who commit serious retail thefts. 
        
       
     52 In my view there are two answers to this submission, firstly, that this offence was committed by truly organised criminals committing a serious retail theft, and secondly, as Grove J pointed out in R v Hayes [2001] NSWCCA 410, the top of the range for the most serious offences is not what appears in the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission, but in the maximum penalty specified by Parliament. 
      
       
     53 For these reasons I can see no error in his Honour's reasons nor do I consider that the sentence is manifestly excessive. I would therefore grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     54 ADAMS J: I agree, but I would like to add some comments of my own. 
      
       
     55 The first concerns the seriousness of this crime. As the learned presiding judge has made clear, this crime was associated with the deliberate infliction of considerable fear on the persons in the store. Even if the office door was not broken down, the attempt to do so by using a sledge hammer must have been terrifying for the employees who were in that office, and it must have been known to have been terrifying. Indeed, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it was intentionally terrifying so that the employees were paralysed by fear, and would not attempt to interfere with the crime which was being undertaken. Quite apart from any other factor, to my mind this element places the offence well within the serious range, demonstrating that the learned sentencing judge did not err in the starting point which it appears he applied before giving a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. 
      
       
     56 The next comment I make is that, where there is significant objective evidence of remorse and contrition, the omission of the offender to give evidence about the matter will be of less significance, though it is never without significance. Here such objective evidence was completely lacking. The plea in the face of a strong, though not overwhelming, Crown case can fairly be seen as a calculated decision made in the offender’s interests. He is not to be criticised for that, far from it. Indeed it is not only appropriate, but necessary to reward such realism. In my opinion, his Honour did so appropriately by giving the offender the maximum discount of 25%.  
      
       
     57 I agree with the learned presiding judge (as with his Honour at first instance) that there was no evidence which enabled there to be any conclusion fairly to be drawn of the offender’s remorse and contrition. I hesitatingly accept the evidence of the offender's father that the offender had expressed to him regret in the language which has already been referred to. I do not understand the learned sentencing judge nor for that matter the presiding judge to suggest, if I might say so with respect, that the offender's father was not telling the truth in this regard. Rather, it was that evidence did not justify, in all the circumstances, a conclusion that the expression was any more than mere words. 
      
       
     58 DUNFORD J: The orders will therefore be as I have indicated.

      R v Craig HAEUSLER 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 DUNFORD J: This is an application by Craig Haeusler for leave to appeal against the concurrent sentences of 7 years imprisonment with non-parole periods of 5 years and 3 months imposed on him following his conviction following trial by a jury before his Honour Judge Kirkham in the District Court at Sydney on counts of knowingly take part in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), and supplying a large quantity of the same drug. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment or 5,000 penalty points, or both. 
      
       
     2 The applicant was tried with two co-offenders, Messrs Hanley and Christie, on these charges in a trial that took some 8 weeks, including 3 days of jury deliberations. The Crown argued there was a joint criminal enterprise between the three and the owner of the premises where their activities took place, a Mr Spyridis, where they were arrested and where the drugs were found.  
      
       
     3 Mr Spyridis was tried separately before his Honour Judge Flannery QC, found guilty and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 5 years and an additional term of 2 years, Mr Hanley was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 10 years imprisonment with minimum terms of 7 years and 6 months, while Mr Christie was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 6 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 4 years and 6 months.  
      
       
     4 In sentencing the three offenders his Honour referred to the circumstances of their arrest, described the Crown case as a powerful one, noted the maximum penalty for the offence was life, and also noted that at the time of sentencing Mr Hanley was already serving a sentence for a previous offence of a similar nature for which he had been on bail at the time that these offences were committed. He therefore made Mr Hanley’s sentence partially concurrent with the sentence he was already serving. 
      
       
     5 He dealt with the subjective features of each of the prisoners and with the respective parts they played in the commission of the offences. It is not necessary to go into the detail of his Honour’s findings, except insofar as they affect the outcome of this appeal. 
      
       
     6 The relevant finding that is challenged is that his Honour erred in assessing, as he did, that the parts played by the applicant and Mr Hanley were equal and that prior to any discount their head sentences should be the same, it being submitted that there were indications that his Honour was in error in making this finding and should have found that the part played by Mr Hanley was the greater. 
      
       
     7 To establish the necessary error on the part of the sentencing Judge, it is not sufficient to point to a couple of passages referred to in the Remarks on Sentence and subject those pieces of evidence to critical examination. His Honour had sat through the whole of the trial over 8 weeks and heard all the evidence and, consequently, was in a much better position than this Court to assess the parts played by, and the respective criminality of, the various participants. I would not be prepared to find error in his Honour’s findings in this regard. 
      
       
     8 Having found that the parts played by Mr Hanley and the applicant were virtually equal and that they should be seen as prime movers in the matter, his Honour said, as already noted, that prior to the application of any discount their head sentences would have been the same. 
      
       
     9 However, his Honour did allow a discount to the applicant of 30 percent on the head sentence because of assistance he had given to the authorities, which he found to be significant and useful. This discount is not disputed by the applicant, or for that matter by the Crown. 
      
       
     10 However, the point is made that Hanley’s prior record was worse than that of the applicant, insofar as he had this conviction for a similar offence and the current offence had been committed whilst on bail whereas, the applicant only had convictions for receiving in 1991 and obtaining benefit by deception in 1998 although, in addition, had shown a flagrant disregard for the traffic laws. 
      
       
     11 However, these matters were not as serious in the present context as Hanley’s previous conviction for a similar offence and the commission of these offences whilst on bail. 
      
       
     12 In these circumstances, principles of parity, in my view, required that some further concession be made to the applicant: see Postiglione v The Queen (1998) 189 CLR 295. The comparative criminal histories were matters which the applicant was entitled to have taken into account. 
      
       
     13 His Honour apparently failed to do so, probably because his attention was not drawn to it, although his Honour was clearly aware of the need for parity. In my view, the fact that the more serious criminal record of Hanley was not taken into account could result in the applicant being left with a justifiable sense of grievance, and this Court should therefore intervene to rectify that position. 
      
       
     14 I would therefore propose that leave to appeal be granted. I would quash the sentences imposed by his Honour and in lieu thereof on each count I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for 6 years, to commence on 11 October 1998. I would fix a non-parole period of 4½ years. The date on which the applicant will therefore be eligible to be released on parole would be 10 April 2003. 
      
       
     15 ADAMS J: I agree. 
      
       
     16 DUNFORD J: The orders will be as I have indicated.

       v  
       
      Nicholas Guy LAYTON and Steven John BURNS 
      
      
       
        
        
       On 10 March 1989, the Appellant (Mr Argyropoulos) was involved in a motor accident. On 16 March 1989 he sought advice from the Respondent solicitors in relation to a claim against the driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident. On 30 August 1991, the Appellant deposited funds with the Respondent to commence the proceedings. In December 1991, the Appellant was aware proceedings had not commenced and believed, erroneously on account of advice given to him by the Respondent, that his claim was out of time and to proceed would require leave of the court. On 11 June 1993, the Appellant instructed the Respondent to commence proceedings for leave.  
        
        
       In fact, the last day on which the Appellant could commence proceedings under s52(4) of the  
       Motor Accidents Act 
        1988, except with leave of the court was 1 January 1993. The Respondents did not attempt to commence proceedings under the Act, nor did they seek leave to commence out of time. On 4 June 1999, the Appellant commenced proceedings against the Respondent for failing to commence proceedings under the Act against the driver of the other vehicle. The principal issue on appeal was whether the Appellant was statute barred from recovering damages for the Respondent’s failure to expeditiously seek leave.  
        
        
       The trial judge held that the Appellant’s claim against the Respondent was statute barred as it involved a single undivided cause of action, with damage first accruing when the Respondent failed to commence proceedings within the prescribed time limits in January 1993.

       : 
        
       In the appeal 
       , per Handley JA and Santow JA with Hodgson JA agreeing:  
       1. The negligence of the Respondent involved two distinct causes of action. The first cause of action was the failure to commence proceedings within the time limit prescribed by the legislation. The second cause of action was the failure of the solicitor to expeditiously seek leave to commence proceedings out of time when first instructed to do so by the Appellant. The Appellant’s claim in relation to the second cause of action was not statute barred as the claim was commenced within 6 years.

       2. The breaches of duty involved in the second cause of action had a different factual basis to the breaches in the first cause of action and the Appellant suffered additional damage as a result of the later breaches of duty.  
        
        
       Per Handley JA:  
       3. The second cause of action involved breaches by the Respondent of the retainer contract and in tort. Per Santow JA with Hodgson JA agreeing:  
       4. A cause of action is separate from another if any of the ingredients of the respective causes of action are distinctive. An ingredient may be distinct even though that ingredient is simply the repetition of continuing breaches by the negligent party on successive days. Additionally the mere fact that the ingredient comprising damage might be similar will not preclude a finding that causes of action are distinct.

       5. The failure to commence proceedings within the prescribed time limit was a breach of a once and for all duty to perform the task by a particular time. In contrast, the failure to seek leave was a continuous breach of a continuing duty or obligation to do all that could be done to obtain leave so as to maintain the proceeding before it became impossible, giving rise to further causes of action during its continuance.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HANDLEY JA: The appellant was injured in a motor vehicle accident on 10 March 1989. He instructed the respondents, who practised as solicitors, in relation to that accident on 16 March 1989. The appellant instructed the respondents to commence proceedings to recover damages for his injuries no later than 30 August 1991 when he attended at their office and paid some money. Proceedings were not commenced and the 3 year primary limitation period applicable under the Motor Accidents Act, in respect of an accident occurring before its commencement, expired at midnight on 1 January 1993 (s52(4)).  
      
       
     2 However, the Court, under s52(4), had power to extend the primary limitation period and permit an action to be commenced within the extended period. 
      
       
     3 The respondents’ retainer did not lapse with the expiry of the limitation period but continued, and on 11 June 1993 the appellant instructed them to make an application to the District Court for an extension of the limitation period. No such application was ever made. Having finally lost any other remedy the appellant commenced proceedings against the respondents for professional negligence on 4 June 1999. These proceedings were commenced within 6 years of the appellant instructing the respondents to apply for an extension of the limitation period.  
      
       
     4 Cripps ADCJ reluctantly followed the decision of Sperling J in Wilson v Rigg (2000) NSW SC 16 and held that the appellant’s action against his former solicitors was statute-barred but contingently assessed damages at $10,500. The appellant’s appeal challenged the decision in Wilson v Rigg.  
      
       
     5 A client who complains that his solicitor has been guilty of professional negligence has remedies in contract and tort. Any cause of action in contract accrues on breach, and time then begins to run for limitation purposes irrespective of the accrual of any damage (Howell v Young (1826) 5 B & C 259, 265 [108 ER 97, 99]; Hawkins v Clayton (1986) 5 NSWLR 109, 122). A cause of action in tort accrues when measurable damage is first suffered even though further damage continues to accrue (Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514, 531; Scarcella v Lettice (2000) 51 NSWLR 302, 306, Cartledge v Jopling & Sons Ltd [1963] AC 758). It is therefore clear that the appellant’s causes of action in tort and contract based on the respondents’ failure to commence proceedings within the primary limitation period became statute-barred at the latest on 2 January 1999, six years after the last breach of that duty by the respondents.  
      
       
     6 However given the continuing retainer and the further breaches of contract and of duty which occurred after 11 June 1993, there is no basis in principle for the conclusion that causes of action based on those breaches are also statute-barred. The respondents committed new and distinct breaches of the contract of retainer and of their duty of care, after 11 June 1993, when they failed to make an application for an extension of the limitation period on behalf of the appellant. These breaches of contract arose after the earlier breaches and had a different factual basis. They thus gave rise to new causes of action within the 6 years. See Republic of India v India Steamship Co Ltd [1993] 410, 420-1.  
      
       
     7 The further breaches of the respondents’ duty of care after 11 June 1993 resulted in the appellant suffering new and different damage, namely the loss of the chances of obtaining an extension of the limitation period and then of recovering damages on the original cause of action against the motorist. In Hawkins v Clayton (1986) 5 NSWLR 109, at 124-5 Glass JA said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Assuming a continuing duty of care, a fresh cause of action will only arise if a fresh breach causes loss going beyond the loss resulting from the barred cause of action. Such a fresh cause of action was established in  
         Adams v Ascot Iron Foundry Pty Limited 
          (1968) 72 SR (NSW) 120 where the plaintiff being statute barred in respect of a lung disease caused by negligence before the limitation period was able to prove subsequent negligent exposure to dust which rendered his condition worse than it would have been as a consequence of the statute barred negligence”. 
         
        
       
     8 See also Sheldon v McBeath (1993) Aust Torts Rep 62 069, 62 077-8, 62 081-3. 
      
       
     9 The judgment of the majority in this Court in Hawkins v Clayton (above) was reversed by the High Court ((1988) 164 CLR 539) and the validity of the principle stated by Glass JA in the passage quoted is not clear. However this principle, if still valid, is satisfied in the present case. The appellant suffered some damage when the primary limitation period expired because he was exposed to the cost and uncertainty of an application for an extension of time but he had not finally lost his cause of action. The further breaches of duty committed by the respondents caused the appellant additional loss when he finally lost his cause of action against the negligent motorist.  
      
       
     10 In my judgment therefore the appellant’s causes of action in contract and tort arising from the respondents’ further breaches of duty after 11 June 1993 are not statute barred, and I would therefore allow the appeal and make the orders proposed by Santow JA. 
      
       
     11 HODGSON JA: I agree with Santow JA. 
      
       
     12 In particular, I agree that the failure of the respondents, in early June 1993, to carry out instructions to apply for leave under s.52(4) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988, leading to the loss of the chance of obtaining such leave and recovering damages, constituted a cause of action which was not statute-barred; and also that this cause of action was adequately set out in the Statement of Claim. 
      
       
     13 If in early June 1993 damages had been assessed against the respondents in respect of their earlier breach of duty in allowing the limitation period specified by s.52(4) to expire, such damages would have been reduced because of the chance which the appellant still had at that time to retrieve the situation. It was that chance which was lost by the failure to apply for leave, and for which the appellant was entitled to be compensated.

       INTRODUCTION 
       
     15 This is an appeal which originates in the negligence of a solicitor in a law firm (the Respondents) in failing to prosecute the Appellant’s motor car accident claim. The solicitor concerned (Mr Burns) failed in his obligations to the client in two respects. First, he failed to bring his client’s claim within the prescribed three years, so barring that claim unless the Court’s leave were able to be obtained. Second, he failed to seek the Court’s leave to commence such proceedings out of time though instructed to do so. The principal question for this appeal is whether the Appellant is statute barred from recovering for the Respondents’ negligence in that latter respect.  
      
       
     16 The starting point was the Respondents’ original negligence in failing to commence proceedings within the time prescribed by s52(4) of the Motor Accident Act 1988 (“MA Act”). The section relevantly provides as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “s52(1) … (3) If a claimant commences proceedings in respect of a claim more than 12 months after the date on which the claim must be made in accordance with s43, the claimant must provide a full and satisfactory explanation to the Court for the delay. 
         (4) The claimant is not entitled to commence proceedings in respect of the claim more than 3 years after the date on which the claim must be made in accordance with s43 except with the leave of the court in which the proceedings are to be taken. 
         (5) The Limitation Act 1969 does not apply to or in respect of proceedings in respect of a claim.” 
         
        
       
     17 The Respondents then failed to apply for the court’s leave (to bring these proceedings out of time) under s52(4) of the MA Act.  
      
       
     18 Considering himself constrained by authority of this Court (Wilson v Rigg (Sperling J, [2000] NSWSC 16, 7 February 2000, unreported) the trial judge (acting Judge Cripps QC) concluded that, though otherwise the Appellant would have been entitled to succeed in negligence against his solicitor, the Appellant was statute barred. That reasoning proceeded on the basis that 
      
       
       (a) the Appellant’s cause of action for negligence against the solicitor was a single undivided cause of action;  
       (b) it covered both the failure to commence proceedings under s52(4) of the MA Act within the time prescribed (by 1 January 1993) and the later failure to seek leave to commence out of time when so instructed six months later (11 June 1993), such that  
       (c) his damage first occurred on 1 January 1993 when his action under the MA Act became statute barred; 
       (d) this had the consequence that the Appellant’s cause of action against his solicitor for negligence must be taken to be complete at that point where the MA Act action first came to be out of time, so that  
       (e) the time to sue the solicitor then commenced to run and thereafter expired, before the Appellant finally commenced those proceedings on 4 June 1999, more than six years after 1 January 1993. 
       
     19 For the Appellant to succeed, this Court must therefore first determine whether Wilson v Rigg was wrongly decided, at least as to its reasoning if not result. While it is understood that there is currently an appeal from that decision now heard, but still awaiting judgment, that does not constrain this Court from dealing with the present appeal though it involve examination of the reasoning of Wilson v Rigg. 
      
       
        
       ESSENTIAL FACTUAL MATTERS 
       
     20 It is convenient that I start with the chronology of the key dates and events. 
      
       
       (a) On 10 March 1989, the Appellant was injured when his motor cycle struck a car. He was taken to hospital and discharged the same day. His injuries were not major, but he was away from work for a period of approximately eight weeks. He attended his local general practitioner, Dr Hall. His injuries included a fractured toe, cuts and abrasions and injuries to his back, shoulder and groin. In particular, he suffered bruising to his testicles as a result of which he was referred by Dr Hall to Dr Kortesis, who saw him twice, but who did not give evidence. 
       (b) On 16 March 1989, the Appellant first called on his solicitors (the Respondents) seeking advice concerning his claim against the car driver who struck the motor cycle, Mr Apoifis. 
       (c) On 1 July 1989 the MA Act replaced the Transcover Scheme. The effect of the new legislation was that if a plaintiff wished to maintain proceedings against a defendant (of the type contemplated by the Appellant against Mr Apoifis) notice had to be given to the defendant and his insurer, which in this case was the Government Insurance Office (“GIO”). Though the notice had to be given on or before 1 December 1990 and was not in fact given until August 1991, in the circumstances nothing turns on the delay, because the GIO accepted the notice. I should note here that the Respondent solicitor was of the view (erroneously) that the Appellant had only until September 1990 to commence proceedings against Mr Apoifis and that if proceedings were not commenced by that date, leave of the Court was required. 
       (d) On 30 August 1991, the Appellant attended upon the Respondents’ office and deposited the sum of $110 as earlier requested, in order to commence proceedings. The trial judge concluded that the Appellant at that time in September 1991 thought proceedings had been or would be shortly thereafter commenced (Red Book, 18, para 15 of Judgment). 
       (e) As of December 1991, the Appellant was aware that proceedings had not been commenced, though still believing (erroneously) on account of advice given to him by the Respondent solicitor that he had been out of time since September 1990 and that if he wished to proceed against Mr Apoifis he needed the leave of the court. 
       (f) On 8 June 1993, the Appellant first told the Respondent solicitor he wished to commence proceedings, these being then for leave, being then advised by the Respondent of what he saw as “the threshold problem”. That was a reference to having his claim assessed as above 9% of a most extreme case and to the possible adverse consequences in costs should he be assessed below the 9% threshold. He was advised to confirm this with the Respondent solicitor (Mr Burns), which he did on 11 June 1993. (It must be questionable whether indeed there was a fresh or varied retainer thereby brought about to seek leave, or whether that was inherent in the original retainer.)  
       (g) On 11 June 1993, having done so, the Appellant confirmed to the Respondent solicitor that he wished to take these proceedings. 
       (h) If the six year limitation period for bringing proceedings commenced to run, not from 1 January 1993 but from 8 or 11 June 1993 when those instructions were given, these proceedings commenced against the Respondent on 4 June 1999 would have been in time.  
       
     21 1 January 1993 was the last date within the 3 years laid down for the Appellant to have brought his action under s52(4) of the MA Act, except with the leave of the Court. Hence only with the leave of the Court after 1 January 1993 could such a claim be brought by Appellant. The trial judge stated that he was constrained by Wilson v Rigg to conclude accordingly, “that the plaintiff is statute-barred from bringing an action based on any negligent conduct of the defendant before 1 January 1993. That is to say that he cannot maintain his action that Mr Burns caused him damage by not making a claim under s52(4) of the MA Act before 1 January 1993.” (Red Book, 22, para 34 of the Judgment)  
      
       
        
       FINDINGS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE 
       
     22 I shall not repeat the findings of the trial judge insofar as they are reflected in the above chronology, save as is necessary to delineate the reasoning of the trial judge. Thus his relevant findings can be summarised as follows: 
      
       
       (a) no argument could be based upon the following observations of Deane J in  
       Hawkins v Clayton 
        (1998) 164 CLR 539 at 590:  
        
        
         
          
           
           “The reference in s14(1) [of the Limitation Act] to the cause of action first accruing should be construed as excluding any period during which the wrongful act itself effectively precluded the institution of proceedings.”  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Here the effect of the Respondents’ misleading advice (para 6(e) above) was negated by the fact that the Appellant knew by the end of the year 1991 and throughout 1992 and afterwards that the proceedings had not been commenced (Red Book, 22 Judgement para 33). The Appellant was in any event aware that leave could be obtained to commence proceedings, even if he held the view that the proceedings were out of time from an earlier date (September 1990) than in fact they were. Hence the trial judge found it unnecessary to decide whether the ratio of  
         Hawkins 
          was as enunciated by Deane J, who was alone in expressing that view. This is because there was no suggestion that the wrongful act in the present case precluded the institution of proceedings by the Appellant.  
         
        
       (b) the Respondent was under a duty as at June 1993 to protect the Appellant by commencing the proceedings pursuant to s52(4) of the  
       MA Act 
        and in particular had a duty to make an application pursuant to s52(4) for leave to take those proceedings out of time, shortly after he received his instructions on 11 June 1993.  
       (c) there was no basis for requiring contribution by the Appellant for the damage he suffered (Red Book, 22, Judgment para 35).  
       (d) the trial judge then observes (Red Book, 23, Judgment para 36):  
        
         
          
           
           “Uninstructed I would have concluded that the failure to lodge an application to seek the leave of the Court in June 1993 was actionable and that damage occurred at that time because every day of delay further prejudiced the plaintiff in the application he needed to make if he wished to have his claim litigated. If that view is correct the plaintiff, having commenced the subject action on 4 June 1999, would not be statute-barred from pursuing his claim.” 
           
          
         
        
       (e) the trial judge continues (Red Book, 23, Judgment para 37): 
        
         
          
           
           “A proper assessment of the plaintiff’s claim would mean that he had already lost his right to commence proceedings without seeking the court’s permission but thereafter lost an opportunity to persuade the Court to grant leave and to litigate against Mr Apoifis or the GIO. If that view be correct, his damages would be assessed as at the 4 June 1994 in accordance with what would be his hypothetical trial towards the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995 discounted by the possibility that leave may not have been given and that, in the light of the plaintiff’s conduct up to that time, the prospect that the plaintiff may have been prepared to receive a sum from the GIO less than an amount that would have been ordered by a Court.” 
           
          
         
        
       (f) the trial judge continues (Red Book, 23, Judgment para 38): 
        
         
          
           
           “If the plaintiff went to trial he would almost certainly have succeeded and I do not think there would have been any reduction of his damages on account of his contributory negligence …” 
           
          
         
        
       (g) the trial judge then fixed the Appellant’s entitlement to about 12% of a “most extreme case” entitling him to an amount of $8,140 over and above out of pocket expenses, noting that the Appellant did not see fit to call his specialist, Dr Kortesis, and, without giving further reasons, stated as to the two doctors whose  
       ex post facto 
        assessments were in evidence (Red Book, 23, Judgment para 39)  
        
         
          
           
           “I am not impressed by assessments made by Dr Ellis and (sic) Dr Conrad who saw him on behalf of this litigation in 1999 and 2000 and who expressed opinions concerning his condition at the time of the examination.”  
           
          
         
        
       (h) the trial judge made only a small discount for the prospect that leave would not be granted, because liability was clear and the Appellant was only six months out of time; he therefore concluded (Red Book, 24, Judgment para 40) that:  
        
         
          
           
           “I do not think he would have been prejudiced in the relevant sense if the Plaintiff had been permitted to present a case against it.” 
           
          
         
        
       (i) On the assumptions that the trial judge made and without a discount, he concluded that the Appellant would have received in all a verdict of $11,474.75 being made up of $3,334.75 together with general damages of $8,140; the trial judge thereafter made a small discount only, for the possibility that leave might not have been given and for the prospect that the Appellant may have settled for less; that led to his damages being fixed at $10,500 (with a set-off being allowed for $248.72 for work done on behalf of the Appellant in the early nineties) (Red Book, 24, Judgment paras 42-44).

       DETERMINATION OF APPEAL 
       
     25 Leaving aside matters of damages, this appeal ultimately turns on the correctness or otherwise of the reasoning of Justice Sperling in Wilson v Rigg. It is necessary to consider that reasoning against the circumstances applicable to the case before him. 
      
       
     26 In Wilson v Rigg, the plaintiff’s solicitor did in fact file a Notice of Motion for leave pursuant to s52(4) of the MA Act (on 4 November 1996) but so belatedly that the application for leave appeared doomed to fail and in fact did fail. I should emphasise the word “appeared”, since the full circumstances of that application are not before us and Wilson v Rigg is itself awaiting judgment on appeal. That Notice of Motion was for the necessary leave to commence proceedings out of time. In fact proceedings for leave were by then nearly five years out of time, the three years under s52(4) having expired on 1 July 1992. Moreover, even judging matters from the time the defence was filed (24 November 1994), which first took the limitation point under s52(4) of the MA Act, the leave application was made nearly two years after that defence was filed. What had brought matters to a head was that the defendant earlier filed a Notice of Motion for the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim to be dismissed, which led to the belated leave application being brought. 
      
       
     27 Not surprisingly, the leave application was refused and the proceedings dismissed. The plaintiff later brought proceedings for negligence against his solicitor on 24 September 1998, the defendant pleading in response on 2 June 1999 that the claim against him was statute-barred. On 22 October 1999 Abadee J ordered that there be a separate trial of the issue whether the claim against the defendant was statute-barred.  
      
       
     28 The present case is distinct from Wilson v Rigg, where a belated leave application was in fact made, so late that it appeared doomed to failure. In the present case, no leave application was ever made. The present case was one where there had been specific instructions in June 1993 to start the proceedings for leave, this being some six months after the initial three years had expired. Yet despite that, no application was made then or at all. The Court was able to conclude that had a timely application then been made, it would have probably succeeded. The trial judge was able to assess damages on the basis that proceedings, if then commenced, would have been only some six months out of time. Hence only a small discount was required for the prospect that leave would not have been granted. 
      
       
     29 In Wilson v Rigg, the plaintiff’s contention was that the relevant date for assessing damages was not when the original three years expired, so annulling the action (subject to leave) but later. That later date was either on 3 June 1997 when the dismissal of the leave application occurred, or on 24 November 1994 when the defendant first pleaded s52(4) of the MA Act against the plaintiff, the latter being some two years four months after the original period of three years had expired.  
      
       
     30 Sperling J rejected both dates in favour of 1 July 1992 when the plaintiff’s entitlement to commence proceedings (without leave) first expired under the MA Act. Sperling J did not canvass the argument that there was a continuing breach of duty by the solicitor, one which occurred on each day after 1 July 1992 (the date the original three years expired under the MA Act) that the solicitor failed to apply for the necessary leave under s52(4). If that argument were made out, this would have meant that, taking the six year limitation period back from 21 September 1998 (when the plaintiff did actually commence proceedings against the solicitor) to 21 September 1992, had proceedings for leave then commenced, so discharging that continuing obligation, then the leave would have had very good prospects. This is because only just under three months would have elapsed from 1 July 1992. Thus the lost chance, from the solicitor’s breach in failing at that time to seek such leave, required little discount for the prospect of failure.  
      
       
     31 Another way of considering the question is this. Was there a separate breach or separate cause of action for negligent failure to obtain leave, distinct from the earlier breach or cause of action for failure to proceed within the original three years? Or are they in reality the one breach or cause of action for failure to proceed in time? In other words, was there but one cause of action, that for failure to bring the MA Act proceedings in time, complete when damage first occurred, this being at the expiration of the original three years? If the former the negligence action is not out of time. If the latter it is out of time. Another way of posing the question is to ask, was the defendant solicitor under a separate (albeit not unrelated) obligation to apply for leave, having first failed in carrying out an earlier and distinct obligation to bring the original action within the three years? Or was there but a single, indivisible obligation, to bring the proceedings under the MA Act in time? The Scottish case of Dunlop v McGowans 1979 SC 22; 1980 SC(HL) 73 offers an instructive comparison. That case was concerned with the date when an obligation to make reparation arises. The Scottish legislation provides that the appropriate date for the start of prescription is when loss, injury or damage has been caused by an act, neglect or default (ss6(3) and 11(1)). In this case the defenders were a firm of solicitors who had acted for the pursuers. They failed timeously to serve on a tenant a notice to quit, with the result that the tenant was able to continue in occupation of the leased premises for a further year. Some years later the pursuers raised an action seeking damages from their solicitors. That action was founded on negligence and breach of contract. 
      
       
     32 While the pursuers accepted that by prescription they had lost any right to sue for loss sustained more than five years earlier, they argued that they could still sue for losses more recent than that. This required them to contend that on these facts there was not just a single obligation but a series of different obligations to make reparation. If there were a single obligation to make reparation, which merely had consequences in damages extending over a number of years, the pursuers’ entire claim had prescribed. But if each item of loss rendered enforceable a separate obligation to make reparation for that particular item or loss, only part of their claim would have prescribed. The pursuers’ argument was rejected. In the House of Lords, Lord Keith (at 81) said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The language of section 11(1) [of the relevant prescription statute] affords no warrant for splitting up, in the manner and to the effect contended for, the loss, injury or damage caused by an act, neglect or default. An obligation to make reparation for such loss, injury and damage is a single and indivisible obligation, and one action only may be prosecuted for enforcing it. The right to raise such an action accrues when injuria concurs with damnum. Some interval of time may elapse between the two, and it appears to me that section 11(1) does no more than recognize this possibility and make it clear that in such circumstances time is to run from the date when damnum results, not from the earlier date of injuria.” 
         
        
       
     33 The question this approach would pose here, is whether there is but a single and indivisible obligation to prosecute with due diligence the MA Act claim, including any later leave required, or a discrete set of obligations (albeit related), the first to bring the MA Act claim within three years and, the second to seek any leave were there failure in the first obligation. 
      
       
     34 In Wilson v Rigg Sperling J’s reasoning proceeded on the following basis: 
      
       
       (a) the claim against the solicitor for failing to institute proceedings before 1 July 1992 was statute barred because some damage had occurred at that date, even though the period within which proceedings could be commenced was capable of being extended by the Court. He here sets out to follow a long line of authority which declined to follow  
       Vulic v Bilinsky 
        [1983] 2 NSWLR 472 which had held that time did not commence to run until the defendant raised the plea as a defence; see in particular  
       Doundoulakis v Antony Sdrinis & Co 
        [1989] VR 781, a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria; 
       (b) thus while statutes of limitation do not operate to bar proceedings unless pleaded, barring as they do the remedy but not the right, that was not a relevant distinction because as from the time the limitation period expired the value of the cause of action was diminished by reason of the need to apply for leave thereafter to proceed; 
       (c) thus the cause of action was complete when damage first occurred, here the damage by reason of the limitation period under s52(4) expiring on 1 July 1992, so debarring the remedy for that cause of action by operation of s52(4), in the absence of leave; 
       (d) hence the plaintiff suffered no additional damage as a result of the alleged later breaches of duty, that is to say the breaches of duty in failing to seek leave, so that no further cause of action can therefore have arisen. 
       
     35 Sperling J sought to test the result in this way by the following hypothetical example which I quote below: 
      
       
        
         
         “Assume a solicitor fails to commence proceedings within time and ceases to act immediately thereafter, without telling the client he had a cause of action or that he should now make an application for leave. Time to sue the solicitor runs out. The client is statute-barred. Now assume the solicitor, having failed to commence proceedings within time, continues to act, as in the present case, and does as the solicitor is alleged to have done in the present case. Can it be that the client is not statute-barred in the present case, where the solicitor has done something, but is statute-barred in the first case where the solicitor has done nothing? That would be an unreasonable result. A construction of the legislation leading to such a result is unlikely to have been intended and is to be avoided.” 
         
        
       
     36 However, that result proceeds on the assumption that in the first assumed case, a solicitor who not only fails to commence proceedings within time but fails to tell the client he had a cause of action or that he should now make an application for leave, is not fairly and squarely within the principle enunciated by Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton (para 9(a) above). But clearly he is. For that principle would exclude from the period applicable under the relevant limitation statute, any time during which the wrongful act (here failing to advise as to the possibility of leave) effectively precluded the institution of proceedings. That situation would be very different from the situation before Wood CJ in CL in Hetherington v Mirvac Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 443; (1999) Aust Torts Reports 81-514 at 66-022 - 66-023. Wood CJ in CL applied what was said by Gleeson CJ in Sampson v Zucker (NSWSC, CA, 11 December 1996, unreported) so distinguishing the circumstances to which Deane J was addressing himself from the circumstances before him (as Sperling J points out at para 28 of his Judgment).  
      
       
     37 Moreover, another way of testing the result would be this. Assume in the first situation that not only did the solicitor fail to do those matters which are there assumed (that is, negligently failed to bring an action within the three years). Assume that then he ceases to act, and is replaced by another solicitor. Assume that the new solicitor then, negligently, failed to seek the leave to bring the action out of time. There would be no doubt that the plaintiff could sue the second solicitor without being met by the contention that the damage had already occurred when the original three year period had expired. Clearly enough, there is a separate cause of action with a new and separate defendant. 
      
       
     38 If that be right, it is hardly consonant with justice or common sense that the result would depend upon the adventitious circumstance of a change of solicitors. With no change of solicitors, on the Wilson v Rigg reasoning the plaintiff is deprived of any cause of action. This is despite there being a second act of negligence in failing to seek the leave following the first failure to bring action under the MA Act within three years. Yet with a change of solicitors the plaintiff can recover.  
      
       
     39 Does the law compel so incongruous and absurd a result, capable of working the kind of injustice that clearly troubled the trial judge in the present case? It was put in argument on appeal that there are indeed here two distinct causes of action, albeit related. The first cause of action is in failing to commence proceedings within the three year period laid down by s52(4). The six year limitation period for a negligence action against the solicitor concerned has clearly expired for that. However, it is then said that there is a separate and distinct cause of action in negligence. It is for failure to apply when instructed (8 or 11 June 1993) for the leave which s52(4) contemplates may be sought in those very circumstances. Here the six year limitation period did not expire, before that action was brought as is now before this Court. 
      
       
     40 This argument thus poses the question, are there here two distinct causes of action, or indeed continuous breaches with each day that passes? I return later to the alternative way of posing the question; is there here but one indivisible obligation breached, so giving rise to only one action, or, are there two distinct (albeit related) obligations each capable of giving rise to separate actions?  
      
       
     41 It is not always easy to identify and differentiate between distinct causes of action arising from a matrix of facts, or cluster of facts, grouped around the specific ingredients that make up title to the right sought to be enforced. Much of the case law on what is a separate cause of action arises in a pleading context where leave to amend is sought. There if one characterises the amendment sought as a separate cause of action, as distinct from an amendment to the original cause of action, that ordinarily leads to leave being refused. That may suggest a readier tendency on the court’s part to characterise what is sought as not constituting a separate cause of action but simply an amendment embraced by the original cause of action. That reservation should be borne in mind in the analysis which follows.  
      
       
     42 A cause of action has been defined as being:  
      
       
        
         
         “every fact which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to judgment of the Court. It does not comprise every piece of evidence which is necessary to prove each fact, but every fact which is necessary to be proved.” ( 
         Coburn v College 
          [1897] 1 QB 702 per Lord Esher MR at 707. 
         
        
        
       And see also  
       Flower & Hart v White Industries (Qld) Pty Limited 
        [201] 109 FCR 280 at 296 (full court). 
        
       
     43 A cause of action so viewed is:  
      
       
        
         
         “simply a factual situation the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the court a remedy against another person.” ( 
         Letang v Cooper 
          [1965] 1 QB 232 per Diplock LJ at 242. 
         
        
       
     44 As Scholl J explained (in Patterson v Richards [1963] VR 179 at 187) in applying Lord Esher’s dictum for the purposes of statutes of limitations: 
      
       
        
         
         “it must be borne in mind that obviously every fact is not a separate cause of action, and to lead one or more new facts by amendment (especially of mere particulars) is therefore not necessarily to rely on a new cause of action at all.” 
         
        
       
     45 The extent to which facts must differ so as to give rise to a separate cause of action is indeed a question of degree. Thus Lord Wright in Marshall v London Passenger Transport Board [1936] 3 All ER 83 observed that a change in character of something earlier pleaded may be brought about by alterations in a matter of law or of fact, or both. In his view, alterations of fact could possibly be so vital and important as by themselves to set up a new head of claim. However, he observed that more often alterations of fact do not affect the essence of the case brought against the defendant. In that case Lord Wright considered that the proposed amendment would have set up a new cause of action, involving quite new considerations, quite new sets of facts, and quite new causes of damage and injury, the only point of similarity being that the Plaintiff had suffered certain injuries (at 88). In his view whether an alteration of facts constitutes a new cause of action is a question of degree. 
      
       
     46 Cases discussing what constitutes a cause of action for the purpose of amending a pleading subject to a limitation bar have concluded that:  
      
       
       (a) a new allegation of breach of statutory duty rather than the already particularised common law duty did give rise to a new cause of action;  
       Smith v Wilkins and Davies Construction 
        [1958] NZLR 958;  
       (b) a plaintiff claiming as a widow of her deceased husband and seeking damages under the provisions of the Wrongs Act, who sought to amend by adding her children as persons for whose benefit the action was brought, did thereby bring about a new cause of action; Patterson v Richards (supra); but contrast 
       (c) the absence of a new cause of action based on the claimed distinction between a contractual obligation arising between the plaintiff and the members of the committee of management of the association as compared to the plaintiff and the members of the association generally; Harris v Raggatt [1965] VR 779;  
       
     47 However, these cases all concerned whether or not an amendment should be permitted to a pleading. The rule governing such an amendment is that where the amended pleadings are considered to give rise to a new cause of action (or are not sufficiently related to present allegations) an amendment will not be allowed. That as I have said may tend to predispose the Court to a narrower view of what is a separate cause of action than other contexts.  
      
       
     48 In a different context, the High Court in Williams v Milotin (1957) 97 CLR 465 at 474 in determining whether there were in the circumstances two distinct causes of action, trespass and actionable negligence, essayed a more precise test. It asks what are the essential ingredients of the right enforced, and thus “every fact which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed in order to support his right to the judgment of the Court” (Read v Brown (1888) 22 QBD 128 at 131). This test appears in the joint judgment (Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Williams, Webb and Kitto JJ): “[W]hen you speak of a cause of action you mean the essential ingredients in the title to the right which it is proposed to enforce”. Similarly Carter v Egg Pulp Marketing Board (1942) 66 CLR 557 at 600. 
      
       
     49 Although “damage” is generally characterised as the “gist” of a cause of action in negligence, its essential ingredients also include a duty of care, and a breach of that duty (Williams v Milotin (supra) at 474). Thus the cause of action derives from the facts to be pleaded and proven to establish these ingredients.  
      
       
     50 Moreover, one cause of action is rendered distinct from another, if there is any ingredient of the respective causes of action which is distinctive, though that ingredient be simply the repetition of a continuing breach by a negligent architect on successive days; Sheldon v McBeath (1993) ATPR 81-209 at 62,073. The mere fact that the ingredient comprising “damage” might be similar or that “each cause of action may be identical for practical purposes” does not preclude the inference that the causes of action are distinct (per Priestley JA). 
      
       
     51 In Wilson v Rigg the failure to commence proceedings within three years involves a distinct ingredient, here that of “breach of duty”, from the later failure to seek leave. Indeed, were it to matter, the damage for each distinct breach will differ, though can never exceed the total value of the cause of action, undiscounted. Thus ordinarily just after the expiration of three years, the damage for failure to bring the proceedings would be substantially discounted by the probability that a prompt leave application should succeed in reinstating the proceedings, given its likely prospects of success. Thereafter continued failure to seek leave must aggravate the damage in the point where the prospect of leave becomes zero. At that point the damage is no longer discounted, but corresponds to the full value of the (lost) right of action. That occurs where the application is either never made or made so late as to render failure inevitable.  
      
       
     52 In relation to any tort which is actionable without proof of injury, or in relation to a tort such as nuisance, where there is a continuing duty to abate, if the act which constitutes the tortious conduct is a continuing act, every continuance of that act gives rise to a fresh cause of action. Here though the cause in negligence is not actionable without damage as its gist. The failure to seek leave in time involves a continuing accretion to the damage suffered. This is as the chance or prospect of successful leave diminishes with each day’s delay in seeking leave, till it becomes a practical impossibility. 
      
       
     53 On the other hand, if damage is inflicted only once, then there is only one single cause of action, completed when damage first occurs, notwithstanding a continuation of the breach of duty. Thus it is said that if a solicitor negligently allows a client’s cause of action entirely to lapse, the client suffers injury only once, when the cause of the action lapses, notwithstanding the recognition of a continuing duty to advise the client of the loss of the action: Australian Torts Reporter [5-380 at 10,604].  
      
       
     54 In Doundoulakis v Antony Sdrinis & Co (supra), the Victorian Full Court held that where a client’s cause of action for personal injuries lapsed by reason of the defendant solicitor’s failure to institute proceedings in time, the client’s damage was suffered (and his cause of action complete) when the limitation period governing the action on the client’s cause of action expired. The Australian Torts Reporter [5-360 at 10,601] says that the decision is authority for the principle that the client’s damage was suffered once and for all when the limitation period governing the action on the client’s cause of action expired. In my view the case only considers the issue of an extension of time in determining whether damage accrued at the time of the statute operated to bar the action. The right to apply for an extension was argued by the defendant as a reason that no damage occurred at the time of the barring. Accordingly, I do not understand the case to be authority for whether any further damage could be sustained post the limitation bar. I refer here to the impairment (or ultimate extinction) of the chance afforded by the right to apply for leave, when there is delay (or complete failure) so to apply.  
      
       
     55 Since this decision, the New South Wales Court of Appeal has held that in such a situation the solicitor owed a duty to inform the client that his cause of action had lapsed: Scott v Echegaray (1991) Aust Torts Reports 81-120. The failure so to inform the client constitutes a breach of this duty which continues for as long as the client remains ignorant of the fact that his cause of action has lapsed. However, the Australian Torts Reporter [¶536 at 10,602] notes that neither the client’s former ignorance, nor the client’s subsequent knowledge of this fact, constitute damage which can found a negligence action, because the damage occurred once and for all when the client’s cause of action lapsed. Nonetheless, in Scott the failure to inform was held to constitute a breach of duty (whatever the true nature of the duty) and therefore wrongful conduct. Such conduct had the effect of concealing the existence of the client’s cause of action against the solicitor, which accrued on the expiration of the limitation period governing the client’s personal injury action. As such, the Australian Torts Reporter correctly suggests that it would appear to come within the principle identified by Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton, especially as the breach of the duty to inform was very closely connected to the duty (in negligence) to institute proceedings on behalf of the client within the relevant limitation period. However, it should be noted that the case itself does not refer to Deane J’s judgment.  
      
       
     56 In any event, the present case involved no such concealment. Rather it involved the negligent failure to carry out his duty to fulfil the client’s express instruction to apply for leave, with damage consisting of the consequent impairment and ultimate extinction of the prospect of maintaining the proceedings. That involved a breach of what can be characterised as a “continuing duty” upon the solicitor in the sense explained by Dixon J in Larking v Great Western (Nepean) Gravel Ltd (1940) 64 CLR 221 at 236. In Larking, Dixon J contrasts duties to maintain a state of affairs, such as “keeping the insurance of a life on foot”, where there is a continuing duty, to the once and for all duty to perform a task by a particular time. In the present case, the latter aptly describes the duty to commence proceedings before three years expire. So too the situation in Bell v Brown [1990] 2 QB 495 where the negligent solicitor failed to execute a declaration of trust protecting the husband’s interest at the time the relevant property was transferred. But the former aptly describes the continuing duty to maintain the state of affairs whereby the proceeding under s52(4) can, if leave is sought and obtained, still be brought outside the three years. The duty is to do all that can be done to obtain that leave so as to maintain the proceeding before it becomes impossible.  
      
       
     57 I turn finally to how the Appellant pleaded his cause of action in his Amended Ordinary Statement of Claim (filed 6 December 1999) to confirm that the pleading accommodates two distinct causes of action:  
      
       
        
         
         12. It was a term and condition of the said agreement that if the defendants did not commence proceedings in time they would expeditiously act so as obtain an extension of time from the Court in which to commence proceedings. 
         13. In breach thereof and during the said period the defendants never commenced proceedings for the plaintiff and never sought an extension of time in which to commence proceedings by reason whereof the plaintiff lost his right and entitlement to commence proceedings and to derive from those proceedings damages for his injuries including non-economic loss, economic loss and damages for out-of-pocket expenses… 
         14. Further and alternatively in the circumstances the defendants came to be under a duty of care to the plaintiff and were in breach thereof and were negligent. 
          
           
           Particulars of Negligence 
           (a) Failing to commence proceedings at all;… 
           (d) Failing to issue a Statement of Claim within a period 3 years and 6 months from 1st July 1989; 
           (e) Failing to inform or adequately inform the plaintiff that proceedings must be commenced within 3 years and 6 months from 1st July 1989; 
           (f) Failing to inform the plaintiff that he was out of time in which to commence proceedings until 7th June 1993; 
           (g) Having been instructed on or about 11th June 1993 to move the Court to obtain an extension of time in which to commence proceedings failing so to do… 
           
          
         
        
       
     58 I consider that such a pleading sufficiently identifies a distinct cause of action in negligence, based on the Respondents’ failure to “expeditiously act so as to obtain an extension of time from the Court in which to commence proceedings”. Though pleaded in conjunction with a pleading of negligent failure to issue the original Statement of Claim within the prescribed time, these remain distinct though related claims. There are here to be found, in terms of Diplock LJ’s test, distinct factual situations upon which each claim in negligence rests, or “the essential ingredients in the title to the right” the subject of each claim. First, there is the factual situation of the failure to take out a statement of claim, within the three year statutory period. Second, there is the later factual situation of the failure to apply for leave expeditiously when instructed, after the three year period has expired. Though the same solicitor commits both breaches, these are each “a [distinct] factual situation the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the court a remedy against another person” (Letang v Cooper (supra)). Similarly, a global claim for damages may be unbundled to identify distinct breaches or breaches of distinct obligations; compare Cassis v Kalfus [2001] NSWCA 460 per Hodgson JA (at para [82]).  
      
       
     59 The reciprocal of the title to the right is a corresponding obligation. Thus it has been said in this context that “the fundamental question is whether a particular legal relationship comprises a single obligation or several different obligations” in determining “which obligation (if any) has been extinguished …”; see “Prescription” by David Johnston (Edinburgh, 1999) at 2.05 and following, and as earlier discussed at paras 18 to 20 above. 
      
       
     60 Here there is a distinct obligation on a solicitor, more especially when requested so to do by his client, to apply expeditiously for leave, when otherwise barred by s52(4) MTA from commencing proceedings on behalf of the client. Breach of that obligation is capable of grounding a separate action in negligence that is distinct from an action for the earlier failure to file a statement of claim in time. That it is a distinct obligation (unlike the situation in Dunlop v McGowans (supra) is reinforced by the absurdity of supposing that this should otherwise depend on whether or not the same solicitor were acting in relation to each failure. 
      
       
     61 One may readily accept that the damage in each situation completes a right of action for that distinct failure. But it is damage referable to a separate and distinct right of action in each case arising from distinct obligations. This is so, though there be a degree of commonality of fact underlying the essential ingredients of each claim and the respective obligations are not unrelated.  
      
       
     62 Thus though it be the case that there be the same defendant and indeed the same Statement of Claim, I am satisfied that a statement of claim may, as this one did, identify the second failure as a separate and later cause of action based on common but also additional fact, distinct from that which arose from the first failure. The Appellant may therefore recover for it under a limitation period which runs from the time of the second failure. 
      
       
     63 I thus conclude, with the deference properly due to the closely reasoned judgment of Sperling J, that he was in error in Wilson v Rigg. This was in concluding that, as the plaintiff suffered no additional damage as a result of the alleged later breaches of duty, so no further distinct cause of action can therefore have arisen. Clearly enough, the plaintiff in that case did suffer additional damage from the failure to apply for leave till too late. That additional damage, and the ingredient of breach of duty based on a distinct obligation, gave rise to a separate and distinct cause of action in both cases. That damage was ultimately that the plaintiff lost the prospect of obtaining the leave which, if granted, would have allowed his action to proceed out of time and meantime suffered the increasing impairment of that prospect. There was also in the present case a continuing breach of duty on each day that the Respondent solicitor failed to take the proceedings for obtaining leave, promptly after instructions so to do. 
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
       
     64 It may be granted that a cause of action in tort accrues when measurable damage is first suffered, even though further damage continues to accrue (Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514, 531; Scarcella v Lettice (2000) 51 NSWLR 302, 306, Cartledge v Jopling & Sons Ltd [1963] AC 758). But that result is here confessed and avoided. This is either on the basis of there being a separate and distinct cause of action giving rise to its own damage, or because there is a separate breach brought about by each further day of delay, until application for leave became impossible. Each day’s delay in seeking leave diminished the chance of obtaining it. That augmented the damage, till the point was reached in this case that there was no longer any prospect of leave being granted. On either basis the Appellant must succeed on the statutory prescription point.  
      
       
        
       Damages 
       
     65 I am satisfied that the trial judge in this case was entitled to have regard to the failure to apply for leave, when the prospect of success of such application was a virtual certainty requiring but a small discount for the possibility that such application would have failed. 
      
       
     66 I should add that it is entirely within the trial judge’s discretion to have assessed that only a small discount should be allowed. It was well open to the trial judge so to determine the prospects of such leave, and thus the value of the lost chance. There is no necessity for expert or other evidence to be put forward on behalf of the Appellant as to the likelihood that any s52(4) application would have succeeded if it had been made in 1993.  
      
       
     67 That then disposes of the Notice of Contention of the Respondent. It also disposes of the Appellant’s countervailing contention that the court below excessively discounted the damages; see para 10 of the Appellant’s written submissions (Orange Book, 5). In what was essentially a matter of estimation, it was open to the trial judge to apply some discount for the prospect that the Appellant may have settled for less than the Court may have awarded him. The trial judge was entitled to conclude that though the Appellant had very strong prospects of obtaining the leave, that was not an absolute certainty. The discount in consequence was small. 
      
       
     68 This leaves only the question of damages as to which the Appellant contends as follows (Orange Book, 5): 
      
       
        
         
         “9. The Court below determined that there should be an assessment of the Appellant’s damages based upon his injuries, which ‘included a fractured toe, cuts and abrasions and injuries to his back, shoulder and groin. In particular, he suffered bruising to his testicles …’ (Judgment – paragraph 8) The Court below had the benefit of assessments made by Dr Ellis and Dr Conrad and no other medical evidence is referred to by His Honour: Judgment para 39. His Honour determines that the plaintiff is 12% of a ‘most extreme case’. The Appellant contended that he was about 30% of a ‘most extreme case’. Given the findings as to injuries and the medical evidence was supportive, although the Court was not impressed by those assessments, it is submitted that the assessment was grossly inadequate.” 
         
        
       
     69 These contentions ignore the limited scope for appeal to this Court against the trial judge’s findings of fact. This is conveniently set out in the decision of Heydon JA in Damberg v Damberg and others (2002) 52 NSWLR 493: 
      
       
        
         
         “89. It would be unusual to set aside, or order a new trial on the ground of, the trial judge’s findings based on the husband’s credibility unless it could be concluded that the trial judge failed to use or palpably misused the advantage he had of seeing and hearing the witnesses, or that the trial judge relied on evidence which was inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence, or that the trial judge acted on evidence which was glaringly improbable, or that the trial judge fell into some error of principle, or that the trial judge mistook or misapprehended the facts, or if the effect of the overall evidence was such that it was not reasonably open to make the findings he did:  
         Abalos v Australia Postal Commission 
          (1990) 171 CLR 167;  
         Devries v Australian National Railways Commission 
          (1993) 177 CLR 472;  
         Rosenberg v Percival 
          [2001] HCA 18 at [37]?[42] and [92] per McHugh J and Gummow J. However, it is possible to set aside, or order a new trial on the ground of, credibility-based findings in other circumstances, because “no short exhaustive formula” of the above kinds can meet every case:  
         State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq) 
          (1999) 160 ALR 588 at [3] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ, quoting  
         Devries v Australian National Railways Commission 
          (1993) 177 CLR 472 at 480 per Deane and Dawson JJ. Another instance where this appellate intervention can take place is “where in a complex pattern of events incontrovertible evidence can only be fitted into the pattern if a different view of the credibility of a witness is taken by the court on appeal”:  
         Agbaba v Witter 
          (1977) 51 ALJR 503 at 508 per Jacobs J, approved in  
         State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty ltd (in liq) 
          (1999) 160 ALR 588 at [4] by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.” 
         
        
       
     70 A fair appraisal of the evidence before the trial judge reveals no such basis for appellate intervention. That evidence is summarised at paras 6.2 to 6.7 of the Respondents’ written submissions which I quote below: 
      
       
        
         
         “6.2 His Honour made a finding that, had proceedings been commenced and the matter proceeded to a hearing, the appellant was likely to have been assessed as 12% of a most extreme case for the purposes of quantifying damages for non-economic loss. It was agreed that, if proceedings had been commenced, the matter was likely to have been heard in the District Court of New south Wales in late 1994 or early 1995. 
          
          
         6.3 Following the accident, the appellant was hospitalised for one day. The appellant’s injuries were not major, however, the appellant was absent from his employment for a period of approximately eight weeks. The appellant attended his local general practitioner, Dr Hor. His injuries included a fractured toe, cuts and abrasions to his back, shoulder and groin. In particular, the appellant suffered bruising to his testicles as a result of which he was referred by his GP to Dr Kortesis, who saw the appellant on two occasions only within the first 12 months of the accident. Notwithstanding the small number of visits to doctors, the appellant informed the respondents’ solicitor that he was continuing to experience pain and discomfort. The solicitor advised the appellant to obtain a report from Dr Kortesis, however, the appellant did not do so. 
          
          
         6.4 At the hearing before his Honour, no report from Dr Kortesis was tendered. Further, if the matter had proceeded to hearing in late 1994 or early 1995, the only available medical evidence would have been as follows: 
          
          
           
           (a) the radiological report of Dr Edward Oen dated 13 March 1989, which reported upon a slightly impacted fracture of the neck of the proximal phalanx (toe); 
            
            
           (b) the radiological report of Dr Sequeira dated 21 July 1992, reporting upon an x-ray and CT scan of the lumbar spine (which showed no evidence of disc protrusion or prolapse) and an ultrasound of the scrotum (showing a five millimetre cystic area outside the right testicle). 
           
          
          
         6.5 As the trial judge observed at paragraph 39, “the plaintiff has not seen fit to call his specialist, Dr Kortesis, who saw him twice after the accident and I am not impressed by assessments made by Dr Ellis and not Dr Conrad who saw him on behalf of his litigation in 1999 and 2000 and who expressed opinions concerning his condition at the time of examination”. 
          
          
         6.6 In addition, the appellant was involved in an assault which was reported to the respondents’ solicitor in a conference on 31 October 1991. The appellant informed the respondent that he had been hit by the police in the same area as his original injury and could not tell whether the present problem was as a result of the accident or resulting from the assault by the police. 
          
          
         6.7 It is submitted that it would have been open to a District Court judge hearing this matter in late 1994 or early 1995 to find on the basis of this evidence that the appellant failed to satisfy the requisite threshold and as such not be entitled to any damages for non-economic loss. The trial judge determined that the plaintiff was 12% of a ‘most extreme case’. The appellant, it is submitted, failed to discharge his evidentiary onus. In these circumstances, 12% of a ‘most extreme case’ might have been thought to be somewhat generous. There is certainly no basis for the appellant’s submission that the assessment was ‘grossly inadequate’.” 
         
        
       
     71 I am content to adopt those submissions and conclude that the assessment of damages disclosed no appealable error. 
      
       
        
       ORDERS 
       
     72 I propose that the following orders be made: 
      
       
       1. Appeal allowed and orders in court below set aside. 
       2. Judgment for the Appellant in the sum of $10,251.28 with effect from 24 July 2000. 
       3. Respondents to pay Appellant’s costs of the proceedings in the court below. 
       4. Respondent to pay Appellant’s costs of the appeal and to have a suitor’s fund certificate if otherwise entitled.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: Blanch AJ will deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 BLANCH AJ: This is an appeal against convictions at Campbelltown District Court on 5 April, 2001. The appellant stood trial on one count of armed robbery said to have occurred on 11 June, 2000 at the McDonald’s restaurant at Casula and one count of stealing a motor car on 11 June, 2000 at Liverpool. 
      
       
     3 The Crown case consisted of evidence from two identification witnesses and there was other evidence tendered. The major ground of appeal argued in this case is that the verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory. Where such a ground is raised, it is necessary for this Court to embark upon its own independent assessment of the evidence. In the context of an appeal against a conviction reliant on identification evidence in Chidiac v The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 432 at 443 Mason CJ said:  
      
       
        
         
         “In deciding whether a verdict should be set aside as unsafe and unsatisfactory, the question for the appellate court to determine is whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused: … Or, to put it another way, it is the court to decide whether, on the relevant evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt:” 
         
        
       
       
       His Honour pointed out at page 445 that even where appropriate directions had been given, the appellate court might conclude the jury did not apprehend the full extent of the warning. 
        
       
     4 In Alexander v The Queen (1980-1981) 145 CLR 395 the High Court indicated that the use of photo identification by the police had its drawbacks but could not realistically be forbidden. Gibb CJ, supra at page 400, noted a problem arising from the absence of the accused at the photo identification. He also noted the production at trial of photographs from the police created a perception of a “rogues gallery”. He said at page 403:  
      
       
        
         
         “… the true question for the Court of Criminal Appeal is whether having regard to the whole of the evidence it would be so unsafe or unsatisfactory to allow the conviction to stand that to do so would amount to a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     5 The first identifying witness in this case was Nathan Brown. He was working at McDonald’s at Casula on 11 June and at 1.30 p.m. he was out the back of the premises cleaning the area. He saw a blue Commodore in the drive-through section and in it he saw a person with dark brown hair with “darkish tanned skin”. He saw that person, who stepped out of his car at the pick-up point for take-away food, he then saw that person get back in the car and reverse out of the drive-through. On 27 June, 2000 he was shown 14 coloured photographs including a photograph of the appellant. At first he selected four photographs and he then narrowed that down to two. He eventually pointed to the photograph of the appellant and said “That looks more like him”. He was asked in cross-examination “The best, Mr. Brown, that you could say that out of the 14 photographs you were shown by Detective Cutler, the one that you eventually picked was the one that looked more like the person on 11 June than any of the other in that group of photographs, is that right?” He answered “Yes”. He agreed that he expected to see the robber in the group of photographs he was shown. 
      
       
     6 The second identifying witness was Ms. Pandelis. On 11 June, 2000 she was the breakfast shift manager at this McDonald’s restaurant. She was 19. She saw the robber after the robbery commenced and then saw him get into the car and reverse out. On 28 June, 2000 she was shown 14 photographs at Moorebank Police Station and she selected two photographs and said they “reminded me a bit of the man who robbed us”. She said “I am not sure but these two photographs are similar to the man”. When asked what features reminded her of the man, she said “Below the nose, the mouth particularly. The shape of the mouth.” She was asked by the police “What percentage would you say that photograph 6L looks like the man?” She said “About 50 per cent”. When asked “What percentage would you say photograph 8L looks like the man?” she said “Again about 50 per cent”. The appellant’s photograph was 8L. Her evidence otherwise was that her view of the robber was limited to less than a minute and when she viewed the photographs, she expected one of them would be the photograph of the offender. In cross-examination she said the photographs reminded her “a bit of the man who robbed us”. 
      
       
     7 A third witness, Clarissa Reid, was working at the service counter at McDonald’s on that day. She heard a noise and saw a man halfway through the window with a screwdriver and he demanded money and pointed the screwdriver at her stomach. She described the man as 165 cm tall, of Mediterranean appearance, with short hair and wearing a baseball cap. She was unable to identify any of the photographs. 
      
       
     8 None of this identification evidence amounted to evidence upon which there could be a conclusion reached that it established the appellant was the robber. In Pitkin v The Queen (1995) 69 ALJR 612, (1995) 130 ALR 35, the High Court dealt with a case where the identifying witness said “This looks like the person I seen take the lady’s handbag.” In the joint judgment of the Court at page 614, it was said “Obviously the fact an accused ‘looks like’ a person who, in fact, committed a crime is, of itself, insufficient to sustain a conviction of that accused of that crime.”  In my view, the evidence of the two witnesses who made an identification in this case does no more than raise a possibility that the appellant was the robber. Such evidence can be of some probative value (see Festa v The Queen ([2001] High Court of Australia 72 – 13 December, 2001), although the trial judge did have a discretion to reject it in the interests of fairness if its probative value was outweighed by unfair prejudice. The decision to allow the evidence was open to the trial judge in this case and it was quite appropriate for the evidence to be admitted. As McHugh J said in Festa (supra) “… the weakness of relevant evidence is not a ground for its exclusion.” 
      
       
     9 There was other evidence relied upon by the Crown in this case to prove the guilt of the appellant. The first piece of that evidence came from Detective Senior Constable Cutler who said that on 16 June, 2000 police went to the home of the appellant’s parents at Willan Drive, Cartwright and seized a sweatshirt and a “Nike” brand baseball cap and a pair of beige track pants. The track pants were eventually accepted as not having relevance. It was argued the sweatshirt and cap were similar to items worn by the robber. There was tendered at the hearing a video but the judge described the video as of poor quality and it was not suggested there could be a positive identification of the cap or sweatshirt as that worn by the robber as shown in the video. Moreover, the mother of the appellant gave evidence that the cap and sweatshirt belonged to the appellant’s brother, Omar. This was disputed by Rouba Hijazi, who had lived in a de facto relationship with Omar. However, there had been significant periods of separation during that relationship. 
      
       
     10 The next piece of evidence relied upon was the discovery of two bottles of after shave lotion when the police went to the appellant’s home in Surry Hills on 23 June, 2000. There they found three bottles of after shave – Joop, Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss. The driver the car which was stolen, Stefan Simmonds, said that it was his mother’s car which was stolen and two bottles of after shave were missing from the car when it was recovered. One was a bottle of Joop after shave and the other was a bottle of Tommy Hilfiger. He was able to say that the two bottles found in the appellant’s home were similar to his missing bottles of after shave. However, he noted there was less after shave in each of the bottles. As to this issue, evidence was tendered to indicate these were common brands of after shave available in Sydney at that time. 
      
       
     11 The prosecution also relied upon a video tape taken from a video camera installed at the McDonald’s restaurant. It showed part of the course of the robbery. Because the video camera at the premises changed focus from one part of the premises to another, it did not show continuous footage of the robbery in progress. The majority of the footage showing the robber showed the top of his head which was covered by a peaked cap. There was one part of the film which showed the robber getting out of the car and which did show his face, but the film was of such a poor quality that it would be impossible to make a positive identification. 
      
       
     12 In Chamberlain v The Queen (1983) 153 CLR 521 in the joint judgment of Gibb CJ and Mason J at page 534, it was said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It seems to us that the proper test to be applied in Australia is, as Dawson J said, to ask whether a jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a sufficient doubt to have entitled the accused to an acquittal i.e. must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.” 
         
        
       
       
       At page 536, they went on to say: 
        
        
         
         “It follows from what we have said that the jury should decide whether they accept the evidence of a particular fact, not by considering the evidence directly relating to that fact in isolation, but in the light of the whole evidence, and that they can draw an inference of guilt from a combination of facts, none of which viewed along would support that inference.” 
         
        
        
       They went on to restate the principle that in a criminal case based on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances must exclude any reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence. 
        
       
     13 In my view, the evidence of identification from the two witnesses could not lead to a conclusion that the appellant was the robber. The description given of the robber was one which would fit many people in the community. The evidence relating to the cap and the sweatshirt did support the prosecution case but only to a very slight extent. The evidence of the after shave lotion bottles being found in the appellant’s home also added to the prosecution case to a limited extent. The film footage demonstrated no more than that the appearance of the appellant was not inconsistent with that of the robber. None of these pieces of evidence individually could justify a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the robber.  
      
       
     14 The prosecution is entitled to prove its case by an accumulation of separate pieces of evidence as was said in Chamberlain (supra) or to use the words of Dawson J in Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 579 to create the “strands in a cable …”. In my view, even when all of these pieces of evidence are added together, they do no more than raise a suspicion about the appellant and the combined effect of the evidence would not have justified a reasonable jury concluding beyond a reasonable doubt the appellant was guilty of either one of these offences.  
      
       
     15 In my view, the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. I would allow the appeal and quash the convictions and sentences and enter verdicts of acquittal on both counts.

     2 SIMPSON J: I agree with Blanch AJ. 
      
       
     3 BLANCH AJ: This is an appeal against convictions at Penrith District Court where on 15 May, 2000 the appellant stood trial on three charges:  
      
       
        
       Count 1: that between 6 March, 1999 and 11 March, 1999 at Tregear he detained Raylene Gordon with intent to hold her for his advantage, contrary to s90A of the  
       Crimes Act 
       .  
        
        
       Count 2: that he assaulted Raylene Gordon between 30 March, 1999 and 2 April, 1999 contrary to s60 of the  
       Crimes Act 
       .  
        
        
       Count 3: that on 5 April, 1999 he had sexual intercourse with Raylene Gordon without her consent knowing she was not consenting contrary to s61I of the  
       Crimes Act 
       .  
        
        
       On 30 May, 2000 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the first count and verdicts of guilty on counts 2 and 3.  
        
       
     4 The complainant gave evidence that she and the appellant had grown up together as children and formed a relationship in 1991. They started living together and had two children born in 1994 and 1998. The complainant gave evidence of a relationship of violence and in particular about three prior incidents. The first such incident was in April, 1996 when she said she was punched to the face, she informed the police and the appellant was charged and placed on a 12 month bond. She continued to live with the appellant but in a second incident he assaulted her again in October, 1997 when she said he beat her with a pick handle from about 11 o’clock at night until the next morning. She described the injuries she suffered as cuts to the eyebrows, cuts to her hands, fractures to her leg and arm, bruising and cuts to the back of her head. She said the appellant was charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment with a nine months non-parole period. 
      
       
     5 After this the complainant moved to live with the appellant’s mother and she lived there from October, 1998 until the appellant was released from gaol on 5 December, 1998. On his release the appellant went to his mother’s house to live for a couple of weeks but then moved in with another woman. 
      
       
     6 The complainant described a third incident of violence on 13 January, 1999 when the appellant punched her and threatened her and told her not to call the police. He said “I’ll rabbit you” and he also said “I’m not scared to break your bones. I’m not scared to go to gaol again. Instead of doing 9 months I’ll do 20 years.” He also threatened that if his mother called the police, the complainant “would be dead before the police got there”. At this stage they were living apart. 
      
       
     7 The charges in the indictment arise following the 5 March, 1999 when the appellant and the complainant together took the two children to Manly. They returned to the appellant’s mother’s place and she stayed there with the appellant on the night of Friday, 5 March and Saturday, 6 March. When she was packing up to go home on Sunday, she said the appellant told her she had to stay and if she left it would be without her son. Her evidence was he said “If you try and take Jake, I’ll kill you.” She said she stayed because she was afraid and she was under constant supervision although it transpired that on the next Thursday she and the appellant’s mother went to the bank without the appellant and she did not try to escape. This was the evidence supporting the first count of which the appellant was acquitted. 
      
       
     8 Three weeks later the complainant was still living at the home of the appellant’s mother and on Wednesday, 31 March she and the appellant decided to drive to her flat in Kingswood to pack up her belongings. The appellant instead drove her to Whalan Reserve and interrogated her about past lovers and he then began to assault her. She said “He sat on my chest, he beat me, he punched my chest. Then he grabbed, he throated me. Then he pushed me, he ran my head into the ground, more than twenty times at least. Pulling my hair, I was bald on both sides of my head. He kicked me, he kneed me both front and back.” 
      
       
     9 She remained living at the appellant’s mother’s house and she said that on 5 April, 1999 at that house the appellant beat her and asked her for sex. She said she refused but the appellant rolled her onto her side and had sexual intercourse with her.  
      
       
     10 She said “I told him point blank ‘No I don’t what to have sex with you. I don’t want to sleep with you’ “ and when asked why didn’t she struggle her answer was “Because I knew better, I knew not to.” She left the house in the early hours of 6 April, 1999 and she went to the home of a friend who lived nearby and rang the police and was taken to the hospital. 
      
       
     11 In support of the evidence relating to prior assaults, Sergeant Killen, a police prosecutor from Bankstown, was called. His evidence was that the appellant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Bankstown Local Court. Amended facts were tendered to the Court and the appellant was given a good behaviour bond for twelve months. The statement of agreed facts given to Bankstown Local Court was tendered as Exhibit B before the jury. 
      
       
     12 Bruno Skuodas, a solicitor with the Office of the DPP, was called to give evidence that he prosecuted the appellant at Parramatta Local Court on 6 March, 1998 of a charge of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm on the complainant. The appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment with a nine months non-parole period and the statement of facts which was tendered to Parramatta Local Court was tendered before the jury as Exhibit C.  
      
       
     13 In addition to the police evidence of arrest, the friend of the complainant to whom she fled gave evidence that on 6 April, 1999 she found the complainant hiding behind her back gate at 6.30 a.m. She said the complainant was upset and crying and she showed the witness bruising and places where hair was missing. She complained of having been sexually assaulted. 
      
       
        
       The remainder of the prosecution case consisted of the evidence of Dr. Tang who examined the complainant on 6 April. He noted bruising and semen was detected on genital swabs he took. 
        
       
     14 A substantial question raised in this case is whether or not evidence of the prior conduct of the appellant, his convictions and his sentence were admissible in evidence before the jury and the further question arises as to whether or not a miscarriage has occurred because of the admission of that material and the directions given to the jury about the use of that material. 
      
       
     15 It is clear evidence of the relationship between parties can be admissible in cases such as this: R v Fordham CCA (NSW) unreported 2 December, 1997, is a case which illustrates this point. There the complainant with intellectual disabilities said she was brutalised by the accused over a period of two years. Howie AJ, as he then was, said the Crown’s case was that the accused had overborne the complainant’s will by repeated acts of physical violence so that she complied with his demands through fear. What was asserted there was a course of continuous physical and sexual abuse. His Honour said at page 6 “The complainant’s evidence of the appellant’s physical violence toward her from the time he commenced to live in her home gave context to her allegations of non-consensual sexual intercourse. Without that evidence the jury would have been left without a full appreciation of the complainant’s allegations.” His Honour said at page 7 “The evidence of the assaults and injuries inflicted on the complainant were relevant to the jury’s determination on both the issue of consent and the appellant’s knowledge of lack of consent in respect of each of the acts of intercourse charged in the indictment.” He went on to say “In this case, where the complainant was alleging that physical violence by the appellant upon her was an integral part of their relationship during which the offences alleged in the indictment took place, the evidence of the assaults and injuries … was relevant …” 
      
       
     16 In The Queen v Preston CCA (NSW) unreported 9 April, 1997, evidence was admitted from a complainant that she believed the accused had assaulted people and shot someone on the basis that it was relevant to explain why she did not call out for assistance in that case. 
      
       
     17 On the other hand the introduction of the prior conduct and convictions of the appellant had the potential to introduce significant prejudice into this case. In Attwood v The Queen (1960) 102 CLR 353 at 359 the Court said: 
      
       
        
         
          “’Bad character’ may be regarded as the contrary of good character. But as a separate and independent fact or matter it can be proved on a criminal trial only in answer to evidence adduced of the accused’s good character. It is not excluded as irrelevant to proof of guilt. It is excluded as a matter of policy, policy deeply rooted in principle. ‘The evidence is relevant to the issue, but is excluded for reasons of policy and humanity; because, although by admitting it you might arrive at justice in one case out of a hundred, you would probably to injustice in the other ninety nine’ ”, the last statement being a quotation from Willes J. in  
         Regina v Rowton  
         (1865) Le & Ca 520. 
         
        
       
     18 In this case the Crown did not lead evidence of three prior incidents of assault as tendency evidence and it was not suggested that section 97 of the Evidence Act was relevant. Of course, there could be a fine distinction between what is tendency evidence on the one hand and what is evidence going to establish the real nature of the relationship on the other.  
      
       
     19 The trial judge did give directions to the jury about this matter. At the very commencement of the trial, the judge told the jury the Crown intended to lead evidence of earlier events and he explained it was material they were entitled to use in a “very limited way”. He went on to say “…that as a matter of common sense it plainly could well relate to a question of consent, to the charge of sexual intercourse without consent – it may well relate to that. It may well relate, and it’s up to you to decide whether you accept it and use it as you see fit but you may take the view that some of the material may bear on the question of detention under the kidnapping count. He warned the jury that because of evidence he served time in gaol “It would be a grave injustice to him to say that he is a bad person, he’s the sort of person who is likely to do this, any of these three events charged. That would be completely wrong. And by the same token you must not substitute this earlier than March ‘99 evidence for the direct evidence that will be given in support of these three counts.” 
      
       
     20 When the statement of facts for the hearing of 6 March was tendered, his Honour told the jury “… you can’t substitute any of this material for the evidence in this case as to what happened on the charges of rape and kidnapping and assault. It’s only before as relevant, if you think it’s relevant, as to the state of mind of the accused and the state of mind of Raylene Gordon at the time these events in March and April ’99 were going on.” 
      
       
     21 On 29 May, shortly after commencing his summing up his Honour said “… those incidents are not before you for the purpose of indicating that he is necessarily a man of bad character and therefore likely to do these events charged. That would be a grave mistake if you approached it that way. It is only before you in two ways; one, the Crown suggests that you would use it as indicative of her state of mind that she knew that if she did not obey/submit, that she would be in for broken bones and a thorough hiding and the like, so that goes to her state of mind as to why she, the Crown urges, why she tolerated this sort of behaviour and continued on with the relationship, and continued on in the mother’s place after 7 March. 
      
       
        
       And also, it comes in if you want to apply it this way, it is entirely a matter for you as to how you deal with the evidence, but you could regard it as relevant to the state of mind of the accused. As I understand the Crown case is that she would argue that he was well aware of the previous course of the relationship involving substantial violence and he, if you accept that, he relied on her subservience as it were, putting up with it, taking it. But that is the only basis on which that character type evidence of previous matters comes in.” 
         
        
       
     22 The following day the trial judge resumed his directions and as to these three previous incidents said to the jury “I told you that you could not use those events to say he was a man of bad character and therefore likely to do these things again. Those events only come in firstly as relevant to her state of mind. She says, in effect ‘Well you’ve got to do what he says, otherwise you get a hiding.’ “ He went on to say “… so it comes in as relevant to her state of mind and also as to his, particularly as to the, I suppose the charge of kidnapping and the charge of rape, …”. The judge then went on to invite the jury to contrast what each party had said about the previous incidents in resolving credit issues. 
      
       
     23 Insofar as these directions were concerned, it might have been better if the judge had not used the expression “necessarily a man of bad character” and it might have been better not to have used the expression “… it is entirely a matter for you as to how you deal with the evidence …” or “use it as you see fit.”24 His Honour used the expression that this material was relevant “particularly” to the kidnapping and rape charge. It was, in fact, not relevant at all to the charge of assault and the failure of the trial judge to identify with precision on which counts the evidence could be considered made it even more confusing for the jury when he said “The way to deal with all the material in the case is to, as it were, put it in the one melting pot and at the end of the day you look at each of these three charges separately …”. These directions taken together were, in fact, a misdirection as to the evidence available on the charge of assault and must lead to a serious concern the jury did not know exactly how to apply the relationship evidence on the other two counts. When relationship evidence is admitted, it is necessary for very precise directions to be given on the use to which it can be put. Originally, of course, the evidence was tendered in this case on the kidnapping charge as well. That is no longer relevant because of the acquittal but care was needed in instructing the jury as to the use of this material on the sexual assault charge, particularly in circumstances where the appellant did not raise consent as a defence but rather denied the particular act of intercourse had occurred.25 There is no doubt this material was highly prejudicial to the appellant. The jury knew from the evidence of the complainant about the assaults in April, 1996 and in October, 1997. This evidence was not only given by the complainant but the Court appearance for the April, 1996 assault was the subject matter of evidence by the police prosecutor who had prosecuted it and the statement of facts tendered at that hearing was tendered before the jury. The jury knew the appellant had been convicted and placed on a good behaviour bond. 
      
       
     26 Insofar as the assault in October, 1997 is concerned, the jury not only had the evidence of the complainant but they also had the evidence of the solicitor from the Office of the DPP who prosecuted the case and they had tendered before them the statement of facts which was tendered before the Magistrates’ Court. They knew the appellant was convicted and they knew he was sent to gaol for twelve months with a nine months non-parole period.  
      
       
     27 In this case the evidence of the complainant was that she had been subjected to violence over a considerable period of time. The complainant gave evidence that after the assault in April, 1996 she remained living with the appellant. They continued to live together until October, 1997 when the complainant said she was assaulted with a pick handle and that led to the arrest of the appellant and his being sent to gaol. Apparently while the appellant was in gaol, the complainant visited him on a regular basis. The gaol visitors book was tendered as Exhibit 2 illustrating frequent visits to the appellant by the complainant. The complainant accepted she visited him virtually every week. She said she did so because he needed to see his children and that he fooled her. She said that he convinced her the children needed a family with a mother and father and that after his release from gaol, they had a reconciliation. She said that he broke his promise when he came out of gaol and that is why she left him again and went to live in her own premises. 
      
       
     28 The history detailed by the complainant is one of a turbulent relationship involving violence. It is one where she became reconciled to the appellant on a number of occasions. She asserts the reconciliations were because of the children but whatever the reasons there appear to have been a number of reconciliations after episodes of violence where it can be assumed normal relationships resumed. Notwithstanding the appellant denied the act occurred, there was still a question for the jury in respect of count 3 as to whether she consented or not to an act of intercourse charged in that count on that day. 
      
       
     29 Undoubtedly, a significant amount of prejudice to the appellant occurred as a result of the introduction of material relating to the history of the relationship. Before considering that prejudice and whether a discretion should have been exercised to exclude the evidence under s135 or s137 of the Evidence Act, it is necessary to consider the admissibility of the material because, if the material were inadmissible, the question of its exclusion on any discretionary basis does not arise. The material was tendered not as tendency evidence. It was tendered as contextual evidence. It was tendered to demonstrate the context of the kidnapping charge, which was the first charge, and the act of sexual intercourse, which was the subject matter of the third charge, and it was tendered to show that although the complainant submitted to sexual intercourse, she did not do so willingly and the appellant knew there was no consent. 
      
       
     30 What the material disclosed, however, was that the relationship had been one where the complainant had willingly resumed a normal physical relationship with the appellant on a number of occasions, most recently after he had been released from custody. Her explanation that she had done so for the sake of the children and trusting his promises to reform, did not detract from the reality of her consent. This is quite a different situation from that described in R v Fordham (supra) where what was alleged was a continuous course of behaviour towards the complainant who was never consenting and therefore was not consenting to the act charged. 
      
       
     31 The allegation of the complainant that she had been kidnapped and forcibly held by the appellant for some weeks before the act of intercourse was undoubtedly part of the context. However, the jury acquitted the appellant of this charge of kidnapping no doubt because the evidence was that the complainant had gone shopping with the appellant’s mother during this time. 
      
       
     32 That squarely raises the question as to whether or not the earlier history between the parties was admissible as relationship evidence in this case. Gibb CJ in Perry v The Queen (1982) 150 CLR 580 reviewed the law as illuminated since Makin v Attorney-General (N.S.W.) (1894) AC 57 where it was said evidence of prior criminal acts could not be led unless it is relevant to an issue such as accident or another defence. The basis of exclusion, it was said, is not because the evidence is irrelevant but because it is unfairly prejudicial. Gibb CJ went on to say that the first thing to determine was the admissibility of the evidence and, in the context of a case dealing with similar fact evidence, noted: 
      
       
        
         
          “It is true that in deciding whether the evidence is admissible, questions of degree arise and that the judgment to be made is to some extent discretionary. It was said in  
         Harris v Director of Public Prosecutions 
          (1952) AC, at p 710, that evidence of similar facts, to be admissible, must have “a really material bearing” on the issues to be decided. The judgments in  
         Reg. v Boardman 
          show that there are degrees of relevance, and I respectfully agree with the statement of Lord Wilberforce that the evidence to be admissible must have “a strong degree of probative force”:  
         Reg. v Boardman 
          (1955) AC, at p 444; see also at pp 439, 452-453, 456”.  
         
        
        
       In this case the evidence revealed the nature of the earlier relationship as one of violence and abuse of the complainant punctuated by periods of relative harmony. It was not a history that led to the conclusion that on this particular occasion the complainant did not consent to the act of intercourse and the appellant knew she did not consent. The question of consent in this case was one to be answered on the basis of the complainant’s evidence about the events leading up to the day in question and her account of what happened. 
       
     33 It may be some of the material relating to the past relationship was admissible on one or more of the charges and in respect of specific issues. It was necessary, however, to identify that the evidence had a strong probative force as referred to in Perry v The Queen (supra) by Gibb CJ. It was also necessary to evaluate what evidence would be unfairly prejudicial in the terms of s135 of the Evidence Act and what evidence there was where the probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice in accordance with s137 of the Evidence Act.  Careful attention needed to be given to what, if any, relationship evidence was to be admitted. In my view, it is clear that the accumulation of the evidence of the two Court appearances of the appellant in relation to assaults in April, 1996 and October, 1997, the tendering of the statements of facts from those Court cases, the fact of the convictions, the calling of the prosecutors to testify and the evidence of the punishments imposed at those hearings were in combination matters which did not pass the test of admissibility. It was also a body of evidence which could not survive a proper application of either s135 or s137 of the Evidence Act. The question does not arise for this Court to determine as to what individual pieces of evidence in that accumulation of evidence might be admitted on a trial of a charge of sexual intercourse without consent. What is clear is that all of that material in an unedited form was inadmissible. In R v AN (2000) 117 A Crim R 176 Greg James J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Further, some form of balance needs to be maintained between evidence relevant to the offence charged, and evidence introduced either as relationship evidence, or evidence of guilty passion (compare Hunt CJ at CL in  
         Beserick 
          at 522; 429). In  
         Bradley 
          (1989) 41 A Crim R 297, Shepherdson J said this (at 302): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           “It is in my view not necessary that in every case the whole history of sexual activity between an accused person and the complainant be admitted in evidence. In some cases a trial judge may have to take care to limit that history to what is sufficient to enable the jury to set in its proper perspective and to understand the acts alleged to constitute a particular offence. In other words, in some cases the ‘full story’ … may have to be limited … In a case such as the present where there are quite a large number of instances of carnal knowledge alleged against the appellant prior to the first of the acts of alleged indecent dealing the prejudice to an accused person may be so great that the sheer number and weight of those instances may well overbear the jury in its consideration of the evidence in each of the three charges and prevent the jury from considering that evidence impartially.” “ 
           
          
         
        
       
     34 The amount of prejudice engendered during the course of this trial by the introduction of this evidence was so overwhelming as to lead to a miscarriage of justice. Not only was all of that material presented during the trial but it was re-presented in summarised form in the summing-up. As a result of this material being tendered in the trial, a substantial amount of the cross-examination of both the complainant and the appellant related to that material. At the end of the day, the trial was significantly about the relationship between the parties prior to the date of the counts in the indictment. In my view, nothing the judge could say could eradicate such prejudice. 
      
       
     35 Although it has not been raised as a ground of appeal in this case, I note that the trial judge told the jury in relation to the complaint made to Lois Buttriss who lived 12 houses away “But if you accept that that complaint was made in that context of a weeping, upset person with a baby in the arms then you are entitled to have regard to it on the issue of whether or not you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt there was a rape of the complainant.”  No warning was given to the jury about the use of evidence of distress. In Regina v Ryan CCA (NSW) unreported 15 April, 1994, Mahoney JA with whom Gleeson CJ and Wood J agreed, said:  
      
       
        
         
          “If the facts of a case are such that the only reason why a woman would be apt to exhibit distress of sexual assault, ie, if other reasons for exhibiting distress such as physical assault, apprehension or the like did not exist, then the inference of sexual assault would be open. But if the evidence was such that there were another or other things present equally apt to produce such distress, then the inference that the distress was produced by sexual assault would not be open. I do not mean by this that the mere existence of other possible causes of distress negatives, without more, the possibility of such an inference. Given other possible causes of the distress, the question would remain whether in the circumstances the conclusion could be drawn that sexual assault was sufficiently more likely to be the cause of the distress. If that be so, then the mere existence of other possible causes of the distress would not mean that the inference was not open. 
         
        
        
         
         If it be concluded that the inference is open, it remains for the jury to determine whether, in the circumstances, the inference should be drawn. This will be affected by, amongst other things, the jury’s view of what are the circumstances in which sexual assault leads to distress of the relevant kind and whether the circumstances in the instant case are such. These are matters in which the jury must act upon its own experience of life. No doubt because of the uncertainties involved, it has been said to be proper that a jury be warned of, in effect, the uncertainties. This, I think, is at least in part the basis of cases such as  
         R v Flannery 
          (1969) VR 586 at 591 and  
         R v Terrence Talbot 
          (Court of Criminal Appeal, 29 March, 1979, unreported). Where sufficient doubt exists, the judge may fail in his duty to instruct the jury as to fact-finding if he does not draw to their attention the difficulties involved.”  
         
        
        
       See also  
       Regina v Talbot,  
       CCA (NSW) 29 March, 1979 unreported. 
        
       
     36 In this case there was a long history of problems in the relationship between the complainant and the appellant. Those problems included allegations of violence made by the complainant and arguments about custody of the children and access visits. It included arguments about relationships with other people and there was cross-examination about the fact that the complainant had told lies in support of applications for apprehended violence orders and assertions by her she had done so only at the instigation of the appellant. I believe in the circumstances of this case a warning to the jury was necessary about the evidence of distress if it was suggested it could be used in determining (in the words of the trial judge) there had been a “rape”.37 If the appellant is to be placed on trial again, I should also note that in this case the trial judge identified for the jury the fact that the Crown case depended essentially on the evidence of one witness. Having done that, he did not go on to advise the jury in the customary terms recognised in R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 that the evidence of that one witness “must be scrutinized with great care”. I believe that should have been done.38 I would allow the appeal, quash the convictions and sentences on both counts and order a new trial.

      REGINA v. ADAM STEPHEN MACFARLANE 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application by Adam Stephen MacFarlane for leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at Sydney on 15 June 2001. He pleaded guilty to four offences, the first being that he had broken into and entered an office at the Student Union store in Broadway and there stolen a leather wallet, the property of David Johnson. That offence is contrary to the provisions of s.112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which provides for it a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     2 The second offence was that on 1 February 2001 at Broadway and on the same occasion he did assault David Johnson. That offence is contrary to s.61 of the Crimes Act 1900 and a maximum penalty of two years is provided. 
      
       
     3 The third offence was that he, at Rockdale on 20 January 2001, stole a lady's black wallet. That is an offence under s.117 of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum of five years imprisonment. He was also charged that on that latter occasion he assaulted Ahmad Mourad, a security guard. That offence is contrary to s.61 and entails a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. 
      
       
     4 The matters came forward in consequence of the offences having been charged before a magistrate and pleas having been entered. As to one of the offences the applicant had pleaded guilty to that offence as originally charged as an offence of steal property in a dwelling house. For those matters he was committed to sentence in the District Court under s.51 of the Justices Act 1902. In the District Court that charge of steal property in a dwelling house was altered to one of common larceny and a plea was entered in that court of guilty to that charge in that form in lieu of any further proceedings upon the charge as it had originally been proffered. 
      
       
     5 He was indicted therefore on all the charges in their final form in the District Court on 4 May 2001. He pleaded guilty to all those four charges and was remanded in custody until 15 June 2001 for sentence upon which date the sentences were passed by the learned trial judge as follows. 
      
       
     6 On count one, the count of break, enter and steal, he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years commencing on 20 July 2002 and expiring 19 July 2005. A non-parole period of 15 months to expire on 19 October 2003 was imposed. 
      
       
     7 On count two, he was sentenced to imprisonment for nine months commencing on 20 July 2002 and expiring 19 April 2003. 
      
       
     8 On count three, he was sentenced to imprisonment for one year and six months commencing on 20 January 2001 and expiring on 19 July 2002. 
      
       
     9 On count four, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 20 January 2001 and expiring on 19 January 2002. 
      
       
     10 He had been arrested on 20 January 2001 and conditional bail was granted to him. On 1 February 2001 he was arrested in respect of the matters referred to in counts one and two. Bail had been refused to him thereafter and he had been in continuous custody. 
      
       
     11 The learned trial judge, in dealing with the matters, referred to the age of the applicant at the time of the subject offences. He was 22. He came forward for sentence at 23. He is a person of paternal Aboriginal ancestry. His mother is of Anglo-Saxon ancestry. He had, in the past, been convicted of other matters and the learned trial judge referred to his prior record, including a conviction for goods in custody, malicious damage to property and shop lifting in October 1999, in respect of which he received two fixed terms of imprisonment and a two year supervised reconnaissance. 
      
       
     12 On 22 March 2000 he had been sentenced to two years and nine months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months on a charge of break, enter and steal. This constituted a breach of the reconnaissance he received for the previous offences. On 4 December 2000 he was released to parole, which was fixed to expire on 4 September 2002. 
      
       
     13 The instant offences for which the offender had come forward to be dealt with by the sentencing judge had been committed whilst he was on parole. There were breaches of the parole conditions. 
      
       
     14 In addition, as I have already pointed out, the second series of offences were committed while he was on bail for the first. 
      
       
     15 The trial judge declined to take into account a number of other offences which he was invited to take into account on a Form 1. He rightly had regard when sentencing to the principles in Regina v. Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 as requiring him to evaluate the individual criminality involved in each offence as well as the totality of the criminality. He referred shortly to the facts of the offences. 
      
       
     16 Dealing with the offences of 20 January 2001 his Honour referred to the fact that the applicant was observed by a security guard in a shopping centre to be acting suspiciously and apparently affected by drugs. He was followed and in due course went into the storeroom at the rear of a store in the premises and was found holding a small black purse in his left hand. He was asked what he was doing and replied ""I am looking for money"". 
      
       
     17 He apparently moved his hand to the pocket of his shorts and his Honour found:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""He returned his right hand to the front of his body and pointed a capped bloodstained syringe at both security guards. The offender moved his left hand to the syringe and removed the orange cap, which was placed on it. He pointed the syringe in the direction of both security guards. The needle part of the syringe was pointing out. The offender was holding the syringe in a threatening manner. Both security guards felt threatened by that act and felt that the offender had produced a syringe in an attempt to get away. The security guards felt that the offender might stab them with the syringe. They both stepped back from the offender. The guards directed the offender to drop the syringe. He then put it on the ground."" 
         
        
       
     18 As to that matter there was an issue propounded both before his Honour and before us. There was some independent support from the shopkeeper for the proposition advanced by the offender that he produced the syringe, but only in response to the request by the guards that he should do so and that he laid the syringe on the ground almost immediately. 
      
       
     19 He had, when speaking to the psychologist whose report was tendered in evidence and was Exhibit 1 before the learned trial judge on 30 May 2001, dealing with the circumstances of the charges agreed that he had produced the syringe but denied threatening the security guards with it, claiming he had only produced it when directed to do so and had denied holding it for any sinister motive. 
      
       
     20 The trial judge made a finding of fact on the material. So much of that finding of fact was supported by the very plea of the applicant as to show that there was here an assault such as to put the security guard named in fear. 
      
       
     21 At the time of which the applicant however was speaking to the psychologist he acknowledged having been badly affected by medication, having taken apparently some 15 to 20 10-milligram Temazepam tablets. Temazepam is apparently a sedative hypnotic medication. The applicant had apparently taken that medication in order to cope with drug withdrawal symptoms. 
      
       
     22 The psychologist noted that that medication can produce a variety of effects including sedation and confusion and surmised that the judgment of the applicant would have been significantly impaired as a result of consuming this substance. The psychologist also adverted to the effect of cocaine and heroin use/dependency on judgment and general state. 
      
       
     23 Although criticism was made here of the trial judge's findings I am unable to accept that, having regard to the statements before him, particularly from the security guards and considering the plea, that it was not open to the trial judge to hold that the syringe was held and produced in the manner indicated. It is notable that the trial judge does not refer in these detailed findings to the intention of the applicant when so holding the syringe, but rather the perception of the guards to whom the syringe represented a threatening object. 
      
       
     24 His Honour held that the threatening of the guards with the syringe was in law an assault. 
      
       
     25 The matters comprised in counts one and two were committed when, on 1 February 2001, Mr. Johnson, the person named in the indictment, went from his private office to the store at the rear of the Student Union premises in the University of Technology building at Broadway. On leaving his office he closed the door. He went to the front counter and began talking to the store attendant. He walked back to his office. The offender was inside the office crouched down next to his desk with Mr. Johnson's backpack in his hands. When asked what he was doing the offender said ""just looking"". He attempted then to leave the premises by an emergency exit door. Mr. Johnson courageously stopped him. The offender placed his hand into his tracksuit pants pocket and said, ""if you don't let me go I'm going to stick this into you"". 
      
       
     26 Mr. Johnson believed, the trial judge found, and had reasonable grounds to believe that the offender was in possession of and was indicating a syringe inside his pocket. Mr. Johnson attempted to restrain him while waiting for help to arrive and the offender dropped the brown leather wallet, which is the wallet referred to in count one in the indictment, the property of Mr. Johnson. 
      
       
     27 The offender sustained some injuries to his face and upper body and he induced in Mr. Johnson a state of fear through the representation that he had and would use the syringe. 
      
       
     28 The trial judge found that those matters supported the offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     29 Both on this occasion and on the former occasion he gave to the police, when brought to them, false names. 
      
       
     30 In respect of those matters he said to Mr. Champion, the psychologist, that he denied having assaulted the shopkeeper, claiming he had been grabbed by the shopkeeper which resulted in a brief wrestling match. He denied being under the influence of drugs on that occasion, although he did report attempting to steal to purchase drugs for which he was ""hanging out"". He reported general remorse to Mr. Champion for these offences, asserting that he was aware that what he had done was wrong, though contending that he had not acted in a violent or aggressive fashion on either occasion. 
      
       
     31 He tended, according to Mr. Champion, to place greater emphasis on the effect that the charges had on him and in particular on his return to incarceration, rather than having regard to the rights and well-being of others, but did acknowledge that his behaviour was inconsistent with his religious beliefs and therefore inherently wrong and indicated a desire to avoid further criminal offending. 
      
       
     32 In evidence before the trial judge the applicant referred to his remorse in a passage in evidence commencing on page 5 of the transcript:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. You know there were two different people in relation to the two matters, the two assaults before the court? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What do you tell his Honour about the effect this had on those people - are you sorry? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Because of the effect on them? A. Yes, sorry. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is it fair to say when you spoke before you told me that? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I didn't suggest it, you told me? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Because of the effect on those people you were sorry for the effect on them? A. Yes."" 
         
        
       
     33 The trial judge also referred to the applicant's prior record noting criminal antecedents going back to 1994 when the applicant was 16. There had been matters of illegal use of motor vehicle, carrying offensive implement in a public place, malicious destruction or damage to property in respect of which he had been given probation requiring drug and alcohol counselling. In 1997 he was convicted of common assault and fined. In 1998 he received a sentence of six months imprisonment for break, enter and steal. 
      
       
     34 Also in that year he received a fixed term of imprisonment for goods in custody and a fixed term of one month imprisonment for possess prohibited drug and six months for receiving stolen property. In August various offences relating to breaking and entering and dishonest use of motor vehicles resulted in a fixed term of imprisonment. 
      
       
     35 In 1999 an offence of stealing from the person was punished by a fine, a larceny by a fixed term of imprisonment for two months and he was punished for offences of malicious damage to property and other offences for which, in addition to a short sentence of imprisonment, he received two years reconnaissance conditioned upon there being supervision. There were offences of break, enter and steal attracting a minimum term of 12 months in 2000 and additional terms subject to supervision and conditions that he undergo alcohol and drug rehabilitation. 
      
       
     36 In evidence before his Honour the offender said, and his Honour accepted, that a live-in drug and rehabilitation counselling and/or treatment course at Bennelong Haven had been arranged for him by his mother. 
      
       
     37 His Honour rejected, and referred to this rejection on a number of occasions in his remarks, that the offender was sorry. In particular he did so because of the form of the questions that had been asked of the applicant when he gave evidence in the passage that I have cited. His Honour concluded that he was not prepared to accept that the offender had shown any realistic contrition or remorse. He refers to that finding as reinforced by evidence contained in the psychologist's report, that in an interview with the psychologist on 30 May 2001 the offender denied each of the subject assaults. 
      
       
     38 For my part, I do not regard that finding as fairly based on that material. The offender appears to have accepted a considerable degree of the factual matrix, though in a confused state certainly as far as the offences at the Rockdale shopping centre are concerned, but did not accept the intention on his part to cause harm or threaten harm to his victims. 
      
       
     39 Further his Honour continues, ""there was no oral evidence in support of the offender other than his own"". There was, however, some support for some mitigation of the crime at Rockdale in the evidence of the shopkeeper. 
      
       
     40 All of that said, there was material from the offender given to Mr. Champion and in evidence before his Honour, which his Honour appears to have accepted, of a real willingness on the offender's part, this time, to undergo an appropriate strict regimen of drug rehabilitation, notwithstanding the extensive history of drug abuse and dependency arising from the offender's sad, deprived childhood and upbringing for which his Honour offered sympathy. 
      
       
     41 Some criticism was made of his Honour's remark, ""many people have deprived childhoods and do not abuse drugs and do not commit crimes"". I would not regard that remark as intended by his Honour to qualify in any way the appropriateness of this applicant undergoing an appropriate rehabilitation regime, nor of his willingness to undertake it. His Honour noted the recommendation of the psychologist that there be such a regime as the ""best chance for effective change to be made and maintained in Mr. MacFarlane's lifestyle and hence offending"" when his Honour summarised some of the statements of relevance by the psychologist. 
      
       
     42 His Honour recognised that the plea of guilty had utilitarian value, but allowed only a discount of 10% for it. He concluded he could find no other matters in mitigation. He concluded that he should allow the offender to try to rehabilitate himself and then, having regard to the totality of the matters, imposed the sentences to which I have referred. He found special circumstances justifying the variation of the statutory ratio as lying in the age of the offender and the need for a significant period of supervised parole for the purposes of proper rehabilitation, having regard especially to his period of incarceration and his drug problem. 
      
       
     43 His Honour directed release on parole and that the parole be supervised, but did not translate into this a recommendation for the placing of the applicant in a supervised long term strict rehabilitation facility such as had been referred to by Mr. Champion and referred to in evidence. 
      
       
     44 It is apparent that these offences were both committed when the applicant was in some considerable state of confusion and for the purpose of obtaining money to use for drugs. The sentences that his Honour had passed were, in my view, affected by affording far too little regard to the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, and the possibility of rehabilitation, particularly having regard to what had been said to Mr. Champion. It does appear that there was some, though perhaps not full and forthright, contrition evidenced by what the applicant had told Mr. Champion. That matter is important as adding substance to the prospects of rehabilitation that his Honour had determined were there, and when one has regard to the fact that any release from gaol, if on parole to a supervised long term residential rehabilitation facility to which I have referred, will have the nature of being quasi custodial and that it is in the interests of the community generally that where such rehabilitation can be achieved it should be, I have concluded that his Honour's allowance in the overall sentence of a reduction in proportion of non-parole to head sentence is insufficient. 
      
       
     45 I would conclude therefore that having regard to the totality of those matters, the sentences as passed have fallen into error and that the appropriate course to take would be to allow the application for leave to appeal, to allow the appeal in part and on the first count, that is the count of break, enter and steal, to impose a cumulative sentence of two and a half years imprisonment to commence on 20 July 2002 and to expire on 19 January 2005 and a six months non-parole period on that first count. Otherwise the sentences to remain undisturbed. So, I propose the appeal be allowed in part, the appeals on counts three and four be dismissed. On count one, the sentence passed be quashed and in lieu the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for two years, six months commencing on 20 July 2002 and expiring on 19 January 2005, with, on that count, a non-parole period of six months to expire on 19 January 2003. 
      
       
     46 On count two, the sentence passed be quashed and in lieu a sentence of imprisonment for six months be imposed commencing on 20 July 2002 and expiring on 19 January 2003. The release of the applicant be directed to supervised parole at the expiration of the non-parole period and it be directed that consideration be given to making it a condition of release on parole that the applicant enter immediately into a full-time supervised residential drug rehabilitation course, the duration of that course to be fixed by reference to what is regarded by the Probation and Parole Service as reasonable. 
      
       
     47 SMART, AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     48 GREG JAMES, J: The orders will therefore be as I have proposed.

He sued the defendant in negligence but was unfit to give direct testimonial evidence because of his injuries, and relied on reports made by expert witnesses which became Exhibits B, C, M and N. The defendant did not testify. On day one of the trial Exhibits B and C were tendered. The defendant objected to passages from B and the whole of C. The trial judge admitted Exhibit A, excluding the passages objected to on the ground that they referred to material not before the court. Exhibit B was admitted in total. On day two of the trial Exhibit M was admitted without objection. On day three of the trial Exhibit N was tendered. The defendant objected to certain passages. The objection was upheld and Exhibit N admitted without those passages. Later on day three, after the close of the plaintiff’s case, the defendant objected to “the opinions expressed in [all] these reports”, seeking total exclusion of the expert opinions on the ground that they were based on facts not proved in evidence, and therefore were inadmissible. The trial judge excluded the reports totally as “unduly prejudicial” to the defendant under Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s 135(a). The plaintiff was unable to call evidence in meeting the defendant’s objection, its case having closed.A verdict was entered for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed.Held, (Heydon JA, Sheller JA agreeing, Pearlman AJA dissenting), allowing the appeal and ordering a retrial, the exclusion of the expert reports after the close of the plaintiff’s case was in error and denied the plaintiff due process of law and a fair trial. Accession to the defendant’s application at that late stage would have been satisfactory only on the condition that the plaintiff be able to reopen his case as of right: [73].Per Heydon JA:1. The plaintiff’s primary argument for the admissibility of the expert evidence was neither referred to nor dealt with at trial. The impugned opinion was not “based on” material in certain “quotes”; “the quotes” were only the source of a theory the expert rejected, not the source of a theory propounded by him: [76]-[77]. 2. The extent of, and basis for, the trial judge’s rejection of the expert evidence was defective. a. The facts referred to by the expert were tolerably clear. They related to different theories of the course of events, not the experts’ opinions themselves: [78]-[86]b. Complete rejection of the reports was in any event unnecessary because excision of problematic passages would not have rendered the reports useless. There was evidence which, if accepted, was capable of establishing the truth of the assumptions underlying the expert opinion: [87]-[99].3. The trial judge disabled herself, by an erroneous exclusion of the expert reports, from considering the totality of the plaintiff’s case, and from understanding the experts’ reasoning. It could not be said that acceptance of the reports would not have resulted in a different outcome: [101]-[104].

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SHELLER JA: In an Arcadian forensic setting, if expert evidence is to be used, a party would first put its primary factual material before the court either in chief or in the course of cross-examining its opponent’s witnesses and then call expert witnesses to express opinions based on assumptions of fact that that party claimed the court would find proved to its satisfaction on the evidence. In practice that order of events is rare. In the first place parties are expected to exchange expert reports before trial; Pt 28 r 8(3) of the District Court Rules 1973. Attempts to produce a consensus between experts are and should be encouraged. In the second place, expert witnesses cannot fairly be asked, except at high cost, to travel to courts, sometimes away from Sydney, to wait for the case to be called and then for that late stage in the evidence to be reached. Frequently, expert reports are tendered at an early stage. Often the judge is called upon to consider them without hearing the expert witnesses.  
      
       
     2 In the present case, it was convenient to call part of the plaintiff’s expert evidence early in his case. If in an expert report, which is tendered, facts are assumed which are legitimately in issue and have to be proved or if the report is to be admitted conditionally upon those facts being proved, the facts to be proved should be clearly identified. As Heydon JA has pointed out in his draft reasons for judgment, which I have had the benefit of reading and with which I agree, part of some of the reports tendered by the plaintiff were rejected and other parts were admitted. No condition was imposed and no undertaking obtained from counsel. In my opinion, once the plaintiff had closed his case, the defendant should not have been permitted to apply to exclude the evidence which the trial Judge had already unconditionally admitted. If this was to be done it could only be done on the basis that the plaintiff’s case was, on the application of the defendant, reopened and then the challenge made. Alternatively, the defendant upon the close of the plaintiff’s case, could have moved the court for an order directing the entry of judgment in the defendant’s favour. However, the price of doing so was that he might not adduce evidence or further evidence in the proceedings; Pt 26 r 8 of the District Court Rules. 
      
       
     3 The confusion, which flowed from counsel for the defendant being permitted to make the application he did after the plaintiff’s case closed, is fully chronicled in Heydon JA’s reasons for judgment. I am troubled by the absence of any effective protest from the plaintiff’s counsel. The trial Judge did not receive the assistance to which she was entitled in dealing with what was an unusual application. It had no merit and should have been refused. However, the injustice to the plaintiff in the result was such that I have come to the conclusion that this Court must make the orders that Heydon JA proposes. Accordingly, I agree with that course. 
      
       
     4 HEYDON JA: This is an appeal by an unsuccessful plaintiff against a decision by Gamble ADCJ on 26 July 2001 that there should be a verdict for the defendant. The trial took place on 25-27 June 2001. The plaintiff, who was riding his motorcycle along Station Road, Albion Park, on 24 November 1996 behind the defendant’s motor vehicle, alleged that the defendant caused him to suffer injuries by negligently attempting to turn right into the driveway of 8 Station Road from the left hand side of the road.  
      
       
     5 The capacity of the trial judge to establish the facts was gravely hampered by the absence of direct testimonial evidence. The plaintiff’s injuries rendered him unfit to give evidence. The defendant chose not to give evidence. The defendant also chose not to call any eye witnesses, even though statements of several eye witnesses had been procured who were apparently favourable to the defendant’s cause.  
      
       
     6 What were the competing positions of the parties as to how the accident was caused? The question has an illusory and indirect character in circumstances where one party could not offer an account of what had happened, and the other would not. However, the primary position advanced by the bulk of the plaintiff’s experts and in the Statement of Claim was that the defendant decided to turn right into his driveway and initially moved onto the left hand side of the road in order to improve the angle of his approach, which was obstructed by a pole adjacent to the driveway. This manoeuvre left the portion of the left hand side of the road adjacent to the double centre lines free. This in turn caused the plaintiff to think that part of the road was clear for his own approach. The defendant then attempted to drive his car across the plaintiff’s path when there was neither the time nor the space in which to do so. A collision took place on the left hand side of the centre lines with the motorcycle striking the car at an obtuse angle.  
      
       
     7 The defendant’s version, as appearing partly in the statements of witnesses available to the experts but not called to give evidence and partly in the Defence, was that the defendant’s car approached his driveway very close to the centre lines. He came to a halt or near halt. Then he began to turn before being struck by the plaintiff’s motorcycle at an acute angle as a result of the plaintiff driving too fast, failing to keep a proper lookout, failing to notice the defendant’s brake lights or right hand indicator and attempting to pass the plaintiff on the wrong side of the road across the double lines.

         “The Trial Judge erred in rejecting the expert opinion evidence called in the case for the appellant concerning the reconstruction of the accident.” 
         
        
       
     9 To understand that ground, it is necessary to examine the extremely unusual course of events at the trial.  
      
       
        
       Mr Nunn’s evidence 
        
       
     10 The first witness at the trial was Mr Nunn, a friend of the plaintiff’s. On the afternoon of the accident but after it, he made various observations of the scene: 
      
       
        
         
         “I saw paint on the road. I saw a mark on the road inside that paint. I saw debris on the side of the road. I also saw blood on the road. I seen a mark on a tree nearby, a oil or perhaps a burnt stain on the grass nearby, and more debris.” 
         
        
        
       He further described the mark, which was inside a yellow three sided marking, as follows: 
        
        
         
         “It was a mark on the road. It was about four inches long. It was in a tear shape, if I could put it in that description. It started shallow on one end and got deeper at the other end, and looked new.” 
         
        
        
       He was cross-examined with considerable aggression, but not so as to suggest that his observations about that mark were erroneous.  
        
        
       Objection to Mr Jamieson’s evidence 
        
       
     11 The next witness was Mr Jamieson. After Mr Jamieson gave his name and occupation, namely that of consultant traffic engineer, counsel for the plaintiff tendered two reports which Mr Jamieson had prepared, dated 1 December 1998 and 9 June 2000. The transcript appearing in the appeal papers does not fully record what happened next, and when it became apparent during the hearing before this Court that a precise record of what happened next was desirable, the parties arranged for the production of a further transcript. It is important to set out what that transcript records. 
      
       
     12 First, counsel for the defendant said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have copies of those [two reports] if your Honour please and I have some objections to them at, probably now would be as good a time as any for me to make my objections.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge assented to that course. 
        
       
     13 Counsel for the defendant then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If your Honour pleases, if you go to the first report which is dated 1 December 1998, the date is right down at the bottom right hand corner your Honour. If your Honour would then go to page 11 of that report your Honour will see I, from the middle of page 11 in a statement, etc, I object from there to the end of the page. Then if your Honour goes to page 15, at the bottom of the page, the last paragraph starting [‘One estimate’] to the end of that paragraph. Then on page 16 in the penultimate paragraph on page 16 where it starts ‘also’ to the end of that paragraph.” 
         
        
        
       The material on page 11 was a statement by Mr Nunn. The passage on page 15 objected to was a short one: 
        
        
         
         “One estimate contained in the material put the impact between 60 km/h and 80 km/h. This analysis would not disagree with that estimate.” 
         
        
        
       The passage on page 16 objected to was also short: 
        
        
         
         “Also, there was some discrepancy between the witnessed pre-crash speed of the motor cycle versus the physical evidence. Various witnesses suggested the motor cyclist was travelling at high speed. However some of these estimates relied on noise rather than visually viewing the moving motor cycle.” 
         
        
       
     14 Counsel for the defendant then continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Then in relation to the report dated 9 June, your Honour will notice there are several things about this report of 9 June. The first is that it does not actually purport to be this witness’ sole report, it’s a joint report. If your Honour turns to page 15. Secondly, this is a report which in essence comments upon the report of the defendant’s expert which is not before your Honour, so that our first submission in relation to this report is that it’s not admissible because it doesn’t contain any material which is anything other than rebuttal, so it’s a rebuttal of something which is not yet in evidence. And as my Learned Junior reminds me, the Rules of the District Court make no provision for joint reports, for joint expert reports, and the final thing is that if your Honour goes to page 15, if your Honour is against me in all of those and allows this report into evidence then the whole of page 15 we object to. Now if your Honour would like me to amplify those objections and give my reasons I am prepared to do so now.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge assented to that course.  
        
       
     15 Counsel for the plaintiff indicated that he did not press the half page of material objected to on page 11 of the 1 December 1998 report. 
      
       
     16 Counsel for the defendant then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The next objection is on page 15. It’s simply purporting to deal with an estimate. It’s really a comment on somebody else’s evidence and it’s a comment on somebody else who is unidentified and it’s objectionable for each of those reasons and should be struck out. 
         
        
        
         
         Page 16, again the objection is that it’s a comment on other persons’ evidence without identifying the witnesses to whom he refers and the opinion is really nothing more, it’s not an expert opinion, it’s nothing more than a comment about the cogency of somebody else’s view. 
         
        
        
         
         Your Honour, at the back of that report is a statement from Michael Nunn, and I take it that that is similarly not pressed by my learned friend.” 
         
        
        
       Investigation then apparently revealed that the statement so identified was not included.  
        
       
     17 Counsel for the defendant then turned to the report dated 9 June 2000. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The first thing as I have already submitted is that it is a joint report. On its face it purports to be a joint report. There are several things to be said about that. The first is as I’ve already submitted the rules make no provision for a joint report but even leaving that to one side the problem with which the court is confronted is that there is no way of being able to identify those opinions which represent the opinions of Mr Jamieson and those opinions which represent the opinions of Mr Schnerring, or whether they happen to coincide in every respect. 
         
        
        
         
         Secondly, as I say, on its face the report simply consists of rebuttal and if your Honour goes to page 4 of this report your Honour can see the force of that submission. …” 
         
        
        
       Page 4 of the report said: 
        
        
         
         “A perusal of the lists of material reviewed by Mr Jamieson and Mr Keramidas indicated that the same set of material was not reviewed by both authors. Mr Schnerring in his supplementary report relied on material made available to Mr Jamieson. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Keramidas appears to have obtained additional material directly from one of the investigating Police officers (then Senior Constable Mark Sculthorpe).” 
         
        
        
       Counsel’s point was that Mr Keramidas was the author of a report which had been served on behalf of the defendant.  
        
       
     18 Counsel continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “… and the obvious question is, what is your Honour supposed to do with all that? None of that material is before the court; none of that forms part of the primary material, and in our submission the whole report is flawed and fails and ought not to be received into evidence as an expert report because the primary facts upon which the report purports to be based are simply missing.” 
         
        
        
       By “that material”, counsel may have meant Mr Keramidas’ report or he may have meant “the lists of material reviewed by Mr Jamieson and Mr Keramidas”. 
        
       
     19 Counsel for the defendant then completed his submissions by saying: 
      
       
        
         
         “Then if your Honour goes to the next page, page 5, your Honour will see that again the report simply amounts to comments on somebody else’s report which is not before your Honour. And again, what is your Honour supposed to make of all that? So it ought not to be received into evidence in that form. Those are the submissions, if your Honour pleases.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel for the defendant did not advance any argument against the reception of page 15 of the second report, despite having objected to it at the outset; the trial judge later appeared to treat the objection as having been withdrawn, for she did not reject page 15 of the second report and did not mention it in the course of her rulings.  
        
       
     20 Counsel for the plaintiff then put the following arguments: 
      
       
        
         
         “Page 15 of the first report as it is, I emphasise as it is, we would postpone the tender but we have no doubt our expert witness will be able to tell your Honour who made the estimate. If that is the case then it is admissible because he is quite entitled to give an estimate of who provided certain information to him and then offer his professional opinion. That’s what he’s there for in terms of his qualifications. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to page 16, the same applies. If we are able to establish which witnesses he is talking about then he is entitled to offer his opinion if it is as always appropriately based and based on his professional qualifications. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to joint reports the matter will be overcome simply with the passage of time. Mr Schnerring will be called as a witness and my friend will be able to determine very readily what parts, if any, or in whole, they have jointly signed the report. Now, it is a joint report. There is nothing to prohibit joint reports. Dealing with the – well I emphasise – if the authors of the reports are available to give evidence concerning the contents of the report and they are, and Mr Schnerring as I say will be called.  
         
        
        
         
         So far as a rebuttal report is concerned these reports as your Honour is probably aware are a day to day experience dealing with one side’s litigation serving a report and then the other replying as it were. In a vacuum well then the report of Mr [Keramidas] presumably would be tendered out of order, then presumably Mr Jamieson would come back and then give some further evidence. That’s impractical and one would assume that Mr Jamieson will be providing evidence to your Honour and his report in part or in whole will be tendered. If that’s not going to be the case then in the interests of the litigation proceeding smoothly then my friend should tell your Honour and then we won’t waste your Honour’s time with having any evidence from Mr Jamieson in rebuttal because if he’s not being called and they’re not going to rely on the report, that there seems little point.”  
         
        
       
     21 Counsel for the defendant replied to the plaintiff’s arguments as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Your Honour, it would not have escaped your Honour’s attention that this case is being run in a somewhat unusual way. The plaintiff is not apparently able to give any evidence of the circumstances of the accident. The witness that was called presumably to establish objective evidence is the last witness, Mr Nunn, and I don’t want to say anything about his evidence at this stage. Usually in a case involving an accident such as this litigation one would expect that there would be a police officer or officers and other evidence led to establish things such as road dimension, point of impact, width, etcetera, line markings, what was discovered at the scene of the accident and so on. It seems that we are not going to be given, the court is not going to be given that kind of evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         What is being done is Mr Nunn is called and now we’ve got Mr Jamieson with his views and opinions. The difficulty that the plaintiff is confronted with is that if in truth the primary facts are never established upon which Mr Jamieson’s first report purports to be based then this whole report will ultimately be of no value, it will fall to the ground, and your Honour knows there’s plenty of authority in support of that legal principle. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Jamieson is being called in the absence of any real relevant primary facts. Now, that’s a course that’s entirely open to the plaintiff. My learned friend can call his case any way he wants to, but the risk that he’s now facing is that unless the primary factual material is called then this report will have no probative value and there will be nothing for me to reply to. So that my learned friend’s taunting of me to say, well indicate to her Honour whether you are going to call anybody, or whether you are going to call your expert, the obvious and simple answer to that taunt is it depends on whether you prove a case, and the way the case is being structured at the moment it’s rather surprising that we haven’t seen the police officer and we haven’t seen other witnesses who would be the logical and obvious witnesses to call to lay an evidentiary basis for the foundation of this report of Mr Jamieson. 
         
        
        
         
         Now, I don’t want to say any more but that is in fact where we are currently standing. With Mr Jamieson being called none of these primary facts in truth being established at this stage, if the evidence never progresses beyond that stage then this report will never have any probative value.” 
         
        
       
     22 To this counsel for the plaintiff replied: 
      
       
        
         
         “That’s true, your Honour, but we’ll just have to wait and see who we’re going to call because if your Honour would accept, yes Mr Jamieson has some personal commitments that can’t be put off later in the case and he’s available today and that’s why he’s being called out of order.” 
         
        
       
     23 A most important but obscure part of the debate then began. It will be necessary later to examine what it signified. 
      
       
        
         
         “HER HONOUR: Where my mind was going was to a related matter. When I look at the objections to the first report on pages 15 and 16 Mr Jamieson is relying on the material. I then go back to page 3 and I see the material and it’s the type of material that Mr Stitt has referred to, that is the transcript of the police statements, that primary material. What my slow mind was trying to get around was how we could delay the tendering of those  
         particular 
          paragraphs on pages 15 and 16 until there is an evidentiary basis for them, that is a basis on which Mr Jamieson can comment, can express an opinion, because the expert report, the material on which the expert report expressed an opinion must be before the court it seems. (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
         
         [Counsel for the defendant]: If your Honour pleases. 
         
        
        
         
         [Counsel for the plaintiff]: Your Honour, it doesn’t have to be before the court at all. It only, if at a later stage it doesn’t live up to the claims then your Honour can make a decision at that time but in the meantime you will have Mr Jamieson’s evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Yes, I’m looking at ultimately …, --- 
         
        
        
         
         [Counsel for the plaintiff]: I agree entirely. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: As [counsel for the defendant] says there’s nothing I can do with this expert’s report unless I have some evidence.  
         
        
        
         
         [Counsel for the plaintiff]: That’s right. There’s no problem under the Evidence Act of ruling something inadmissible later on down the track or doing whatever your Honour wants to. But in relation to Mr Jamieson he’s here right now and ready to give his evidence.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge’s rulings on Mr Jamieson’s evidence 
        
       
     24 The actual rulings of the trial judge are then recorded as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Report number one, we will receive with the passage on page 11 struck out, that we have already identified and that’s the second half of the page, beginning with ‘In a statement made by Michael Nunn’. You’ve conceded that and the passages that [counsel for the defendant] has identified are currently not before the court then that’s that final ‘one estimate’ and on page 16 the paragraph also down to ‘moving motor cycle’. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to the joint report, if both the experts are to be called then, though it’s rather messy, perhaps, I see no objection to receiving a report from them. In relation to page 4, I take that first sentence to mean, ‘perusal of the lists of material reviewed by Mr Jamieson and Mr [Keramidas]’ indicated that Mr Jamieson and Mr [Keramidas] didn’t see the same material not that Mr [Schnerring] and Mr Jamieson didn’t see the same material, because the next sentence is ‘Mr [Schnerring] saw the same material as Mr Jamieson has’ in which case the material on which they rely is clear and one assumes that if Mr [Keramidas’] report is tendered we will know the material on which he bases his opinion and Mr Jamieson and Mr [Schnerring] ought to be able to then identify the gap for us. 
         
        
        
         
         The nature of the report, although I haven’t read it, as a rebuttal of another report – my experience is that is no objection to an expert report, and is standard practice in this court, and indeed one encourages experts. I think the code of practice encourages experts to compare notes and to discuss each other’s reports, that’s most helpful, so I think the report is unobjectionable on that basis. 
         
        
        
         
         Page 5, that covers that point that it’s a comment on Mr [Keramidas’] report. If Mr [Keramidas’] report never comes into evidence, then so be it. There is I think – [counsel for the plaintiff], you would find it difficult to make use of this report. Those are my rulings in respect of those matters.”  
         
        
       
     25 Though the principal transcript does not record this clearly, the 1 December 1998 report was marked Exhibit B, subject to the deletion of the passages on page 11 (not pressed), page 15 (rejected) and page 16 (rejected). The 9 June 2000 report was marked Exhibit C, with the trial judge noting but not resolving a possible difficulty that might arise if Mr Keramidas’ report, to which it replied, did not come into evidence. This difficulty did not in fact come to have any decisive significance, and the supposed difficulty occasioned by Exhibit C being a joint report did not come to have any significance at all. 
      
       
        
       Mr Jamieson’s oral evidence 
        
       
     26 Mr Jamieson then gave more than six pages of evidence in chief. Among it was the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “HER HONOUR: Q. What material did you have, Mr Jamieson? 
         
        
        
         
         A. On page 3 of my report dated 1 December 1998, I was supplied with various documents and photographs and so on [including statements of persons not called as witnesses], and that’s listed. I also looked at the site on 20 November 1998.  
         
        
        
         
         [Counsel for the plaintiff]: Q. On the basis of the material listed, you record a view, how do you say the accident happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I reviewed this material I have listed on page 3, which included the descriptions of damage and so on, including the photographs of the motor cycle that I have shown in my page 12, and also paint marks made on the road, which I have included in my figure 8. On the basis of that material I had available to me at that time, it was evident that an impact occurred between a turning Volvo and a motorcycle travelling in approximately the same direction as the original travel of the Volvo. What focussed my attention was the angle of impact, which related to the likely pre-impact movements of the Volvo. The matters which determined the angle of impact were the damage to the Volvo, the damage to the motorcycle, the rest position of the motorcyclist and the movement of the motorcycle itself after impact. The remaining piece of the puzzle, in my view, was a position of a power pole immediately next to the driveway in which the driver was evidently turning into, which dictated the angle in which the driver needed to enter the driveway. Taking all those matters into consideration, it was clear in my mind that it was a quite obtuse angle impact. That means nearer 90 degrees rather than zero degrees, or should I say, greater than 45 degrees which defines an obtuse angle impact. Combined with the paint mark left on the roadway, it appeared that the Volvo commenced to turn right into a driveway but most relevantly it appeared to turn right not from near the centre line of the road but rather from somewhere to the driver’s left as he was proceeding along and then by the time he reached an area near the centre of the road -- 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION. SPECULATION. LEGAL ARGUMENT. 
         
        
        
         
         [Counsel for the plaintiff]: Q. Where were we, Mr Jamieson? 
         
        
        
         
         A. We were having a turning Volvo and the physical evidence which comprised the marking on the roadway is presumably marked by investigating police – that’s an assumption I made – the described damage to the Volvo and the quite distinct damage to the motor cycle combined with the witnessed rest position of the motor cyclist and the witnesses – or the recorded I should say – post impact path of the motor cycle, all were totally consistent with an obtuse angle impact which occurred on the motor cyclist’s correct side of the road. And, as my report said, some witnesses had different views. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In terms of the speed of the motor cycle, do you wish to say anything about that, at the point of impact first of all, if that is possible? 
         
        
        
         
         A. From a physics viewpoint it’s possible to create a broad guide based on the damage sustained to both vehicles and the so-called throw distance of the motor cyclist and one can only produce a range of speeds, there is no science to produce a precise number but the damage in the throw distance appeared not to be inconsistent with a impact speed in the 60s or 70s.” 
         
        
       
     27 Certain photographs were then tendered and admitted as Exhibits D and E. Mr Jamieson indicated aspects of the photographs which “gave weight to my view that it was an obtuse angle impact”. He was then asked about a diagram in Exhibit B called “Figure 10”: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Figure 10, what does it represent so far as your opinion is concerned? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Figure 10 was plotted to represent the impact geometry as suggested by the physical damage to the respective vehicles and the mark on the road. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Does it purport to demonstrate in a drawing or diagram how the accident impact took place? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, it demonstrates the impact geometry and the reason I have got the dotted lines marked ‘swept path’ is simply the physical constraints of a vehicle turning, a vehicle can’t spin on its axis. That’s why I put in those dotted lines so implicit in figure 10 is the pre-crash movements of the Volvo, constrained as it was by its turning restriction.” 
         
        
        
       The “mark on the road”, it may be inferred, was that described by Mr Nunn.  
        
       
     28 While Mr Jamieson’s reports did not expressly conclude that the second theory of the accident illustrated in Figure 10 was correct, he did doubt the first theory, his rejection of the first theory pointed strongly to the second, he appeared to regard the physical evidence as pointing to the second theory, his oral evidence supported the second theory, and his colleague Mr Schnerring supported the second theory “strongly”. The cross-examination did not shake Mr Jamieson even though the record of it extends over thirty-nine pages and was conducted with much force and ability. There was no re-examination. The first day’s proceedings then ended.  
      
       
        
       The events of the second day 
        
       
     29 The opening part of the second day was taken up with the evidence of Mr Dent, an officer of the Roads and Traffic Authority, the tendering of exhibits through him, and the evidence of Mr Gosling, another officer of the Roads and Traffic Authority at the material time. Mr Schnerring, an engineer, who was the joint author of Exhibit C, then entered the witness box, and a report of his prepared for Jamieson Foley and dated 11 January 2000 was tendered and marked Exhibit M. The transcript records that it was admitted without objection. His evidence in chief is recorded over three pages. He was asked, without objection, whether he adhered to the following passage in Exhibit M: 
      
       
        
         
         “The damage to the two vehicles involved in the crash supports the view that the Volvo sedan was turning from either the left part of the westbound lane or from the road shoulder on the southern side of the road, and that Jason Rhoden was passing the Volvo near to the centreline but on the correct side of the road at impact.” 
         
        
        
       He said he did. He also said that there was nothing in the report which he wished to alter. The record of his cross-examination, which extends over twenty-five pages, does not reveal any shaking of his opinions.  
        
       
     30 Another officer of the Roads and Transport Authority, Mr Chapman, then gave evidence, and the second day concluded. 
      
       
        
       The events on the morning of the third day 
        
       
     31 The third day opened with the calling by the plaintiff of Mr Wingrove, a transport engineer. His report of 4 May 2001 was tendered. The operative part of it was three pages long; paragraphs 5-7, being part of one page, were objected to by counsel for the defendant and rejected. According to the transcript, there was no other objection, and the report was admitted without paragraphs 5-7 and numbered Exhibit N. Those paragraphs criticised the accuracy of what two persons, who were not called to give evidence, said in their witness statements. Mr Wingrove’s evidence in chief is recorded over about three pages. The transcript records the following in the course of his evidence in chief: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you come to any conclusion as to where the Volvo sedan commenced to make its turn into what ended up being the drive way of the owner’s house? 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION. NOT INCLUDED IN REPORT. REPHRASE QUESTION.” 
         
        
       
     32 The cross-examination is recorded over more than five pages. After some brief re-examination, short evidence was given by the plaintiff’s father about his clothing, and Mr Northy gave evidence about Honda motorcycles.  
      
       
        
       The defendant’s application to exclude the opinion evidence called by the plaintiff  
        
       
     33 The principal transcript then records: 
      
       
        
         
         “WITNESS EXCUSED 
         
        
        
         
         CLOSE OF CASE FOR PLAINTIFF 
         
        
        
         
         LEGAL ARGUMENT” 
         
        
       
     34 Lest there be any doubt that the legal argument took place after the plaintiff had closed his case, the trial judge recorded that fact in a judgment she gave after the legal argument. Further, an additional transcript recorded that legal argument over ten pages. It commenced thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “[Counsel for the plaintiff]: That’s our case with this proviso by arrangement with my friend he accepts what I said from the bar table and maintain from the bar table that the plaintiff cannot remember the circumstances of the accident. 
         
        
        
         
         [Counsel for the defendant]: Your Honour, there is a submission which I wish to make at this stage in relation to exhibits B, C, M and N. Your Honour, the submission is this that each of those exhibits purports to be an expert report. The submission of the defendant is that none of the opinions expressed in those reports has any probative value and those opinions should not be accepted as evidence for the following reasons.” 
         
        
       
     35 The reasons which counsel for the defendant then developed were, first, that an expert opinion was not valuable unless the facts on which it was based were proved by admissible evidence; and, secondly, that if they were not, the opinion based on them “falls to the ground” and “is itself inadmissible”. He said that much of the material on which Mr Jamieson said he relied in composing Exhibit B was not in evidence; and that the report did not identify specifically which particular items among the totality of the material listed by Mr Jamieson was relied on. He said that the same applied to Exhibit N. He made the same submission about Exhibit C, with the additional point that Exhibit C, unlike Exhibit B, had not identified the totality of the material, whether tendered or not, which had been examined. He said that Exhibit M was simply an examination of which of the two “crash scenarios” described in Exhibit B was more likely, and hence did not stand on any factual basis of its own.  
      
       
     36 Counsel for the plaintiff made the following primary point: 
      
       
        
         
         “The reasons why the reports are admissible are as follows: (1) that the experts qualifications are not in issue; (2) that the mere fact that we do not establish the factual basis of accounts that we reject in forming our opinion is ill founded. If Mr Jamieson or Mr Schnerring said on one occasion, I think they said it on 7 or 8 occasions, ‘we reject the eye witness accounts in coming to our conclusion.’ 
         
        
        
         
         It wouldn’t have mattered one jot if we tendered the statements. Our submission would still be their opinion is based on a rejection of these accounts. What they do say is, having rejected those accounts, this is what we based our opinion on. In relation to Jamieson, physical inspection of the scene, photographs and positions of the vehicles according to the accounts. He’s entitled to do that and I argue this strongly to your Honour. Assume that there are no witnesses to a motor vehicle accident. One is dead, the other one is sufficiently maimed or incapacitated that they cannot remember and there are no eye witnesses. 
         
        
        
         
         Is it seriously put that a accident reconstructionists who in fact are regularly called in fortunately such rare cases to say this is my opinion based on what I have and in many instances it’s an inspection of the scene. It’s an inspection of photographs, debris, et al. It’s plainly admissible. The weight, the interpretation, the cogency of all of the contents of these things is ultimately a matter for your Honour.” 
         
        
       
     37 He then referred to Paric v John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd (1985) 59 ALJR 844 at 846 and quoted the first sentence in the passage set out in [38] below. He then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ … is there any issue that they’re the right photographs, is there any issue that is it the right car, is it the right motorcycle, is it the right street. All of those things we say are established unequivocally as facts. He’s entitled to then say, well, look on the basis of those matters alone I offer my opinion … .” 
         
        
       
     38 Counsel for the plaintiff then quoted the last three sentences of the following passage from Paric’s case: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is trite law that for an expert medical opinion to be of any value the facts upon which it is based must be proved by admissible evidence … . But that does not mean that the facts so proved must correspond with complete precision to the proposition on which the opinion is based. The passages from  
         Wigmore on Evidence  
         cited by Samuels JA in the Court of Appeal ( 
         Wigmore on Evidence 
         , (1940) 3rd ed, vol II, para 680, p 800; 2 Wigmore, evidence para 680 (Chadbourn Rev 1979), p 942) to the effect that it is a question of fact whether the case supposed is sufficiently like the one under consideration to render the opinion of the expert of any value are in accordance with both principle and commonsense.  
         
        
        
         
         As Wigmore states (at pp 941-2, Chadbourn Rev), ‘the failure which justifies rejection must be a failure in some one or more important data, not merely in a trifling respect.’”  
         
        
       
     39 Counsel for the plaintiff then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The reason his Honour may have already considered why contrary versions are put in our reports so that the expert can say whether they agree with them or not. We don’t have to establish whether they are factual or not. If they are according to the defendant, well that will be established at some stage. They are argued by the experts rejected and then their opinion is offered in a standard we say application of the rules.” 
         
        
       
     40 Counsel for the plaintiff then argued that if, as he contended, the evidence was admissible under ss 76-80 of the Evidence Act 1995, it ought not to be rejected under s 135 (which gives the court a discretion to exclude evidence when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial, misleading or confusing, or unduly wasteful of time). He submitted that the plaintiff’s expert evidence was not unfair or prejudicial, and it saved time. He then referred to various authorities discussed in Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (4th ed), page 182, but apologised for not having the volumes in court: 
      
       
        
         
         “This is meant, and I emphasise this, of no criticism of my friend but I wasn’t aware as to precisely what application he was to make.” 
         
        
       
     41 Counsel for the defendant then rebutted some of the plaintiff’s arguments, repeated his own in greater detail, and put arguments which he had not put in chief, as a secondary position, to the effect that the evidence should be rejected under s 135. 
      
       
     42 Counsel for the plaintiff then put further arguments, only one of which need be noted: 
      
       
        
         
         “It would not have escaped your Honour’s attention that my friend introduced in cross-examination these competing versions. Put to them, kept on putting to them, ‘Well why do you reject these eye witnesses’ and they gave their version why they did. So not only is it admissible in their oral evidence as to why they did it but their reasons as to why.” 
         
        
        
       The reasons for judgment granting the defendant’s application 
        
       
     43 The trial judge then adjourned until after lunch. On resumption she delivered a judgment dealing with the defendant’s application.  
      
       
     44 The trial judge referred to various cases and then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Those authorities lead me to suggest that there are three tasks for me in this case. One, to assess from the expert reports and from the oral evidence whether Messrs Jamieson, Schnerring and Wingrove have identified the facts they were assuming to be true sufficiently to enable them to be measured against the evidence and then secondly, to assess whether the end product, that is those parts of their reports and evidence that are based on such identifiable evidence are relevant under section 55 and thirdly, if relevant, then whether they should be excluded under section 135 as prejudicial.” 
         
        
       
     45 She then said that Mr Jamieson’s report, Exhibit B, was in large measure not related to primary material quoted or summarised in the report. She said that Mr Jamieson’s discussion of two competing hypothetical explanations for the accident was “based on a selection of unspecified evidence”. She said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If I were to hold such evidence to be relevant under section 55, which I do not, it would put the defendant in the impossible position of having to adduce all the evidence relied on by all the reports in order to be confident that it was able to rebut the suppositions being put forward by Mr Jamieson.” 
         
        
       
     46 The trial judge then turned to a discussion of how s 135 had been applied in other cases. She continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Other aspects, I think, of the report of 1 December which may lead to even greater prejudice, are the fact that there, as against the two versions put against each other as hypotheticals, are the references in the report to such things as ‘not all witnesses’ in paragraph 5, ‘pavement markings noted by police’ and then further comment in paragraph 5.1 following that, the comment ‘noted marks on the eastbound lane’ which are probably by the police but could be anyone, references to ‘various witnesses’, ‘some material suggested’ and finally, in paragraph 6, ‘if one took the witness statements at face value’ and the other comment, ‘however, various physical evidence did not support this’ and in paragraph 6, as well, ‘the discrepancies between the witnessed pre crash speed of motor cycle and the physical evidence’. All that is very general and unspecific. 
         
        
        
         
         As the report of the 11 January 2000, exhibit M, depends on the two versions set up in exhibit B, it falls with that report. Exhibit C, the review of Mr Keramidas’s report is difficult to assess in the absence of that report, but I suspect it too was founded on the same general evidence as exhibit B and M, and when considered with them, Keramidas report will not be admissible. Exhibit N, the report of Colin Wingrove of 4 May 2001, in the absence of any factual evidence against which to assess this report, it can best also be hypothetical, and as it’s based very generally on the same evidence as the other reports it suffers the same problems as those reports. 
         
        
        
         
         My conclusions are then that the reports of Jamieson, Foley and Associates of 1 December ’98, 11 January 2000 and the report of 9 June 2000 and the report of Colin Wingrove of 4 May 2001, should be excluded under section 135[(a)].” 
         
        
       
     47 It is difficult to follow the passage just quoted so far as it analyses Exhibit B without setting out paragraphs 5, 5.1 and 6, to which it refers. As far as possible, phrases which the trial judge placed in quotation marks or phrases similar to those phrases, are emphasised. The last phrase emphasised to which the trial judge referred was part of a paragraph on page 16 of Exhibit B which had been rejected when Exhibit B was originally tendered on 25 June 2001. 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         5. CRASH ANALYSIS 
         
        
        
         
         From the material, there appeared to be two basic versions of the crash presented. 
         
        
        
         
         The version presented by  
         the witnesses 
          (some evidently independent) involve the westbound Volvo approaching number 8 Station Road on its right, occupying road space close to the centre line, coming to an almost halt. Just as it commenced its turn right into the driveway, the Volvo was impacted on the right rear quarter by an overtaking motorcycle. 
         
        
        
         
         The alternative version implied that the Volvo had not been close to the centreline but rather had been towards the left, possibly near the southern kerb of Station Road, and commenced either a full right turn towards the driveway, or a U-turn. The resultant impact occurred on a westbound lane when the Volvo was straddling the centreline at an obtuse angle. 
         
        
        
         
         Figure 9 overleaf shows plot of the crash scene at a scale of 1:200 showing: 
         
        
       
     · the east-west alignment of Station Road, 
      
       
     · the pavement markings, 
      
       
     · the position of the driveway at number 8 Station Road, 
      
       
     · the positions of the utility pole adjacent to the driveway and the street tree. 
      
       
        
         
         Also plotted on the Figure 9 was the ‘swept path’ needed by a turning Volvo if it was to drive straight into the driveway and allowing for the proximity of the pole. This swept path was plotted from Australian Standard AS2890.1, Supplement 1 – 1988, ‘ 
         Templates – Off Street Parking 
         ’. 
         
        
        
         
         The most relevant element of Figure 9 is that due to the proximity of the utility pole, any driver wishing to manoeuvre a large sedan into the narrow driveway would need to have effectively come to a complete stop before tightly turning right. 
         
        
        
         
         Figure 10 overleaf shows a similar plot to Figure 9 but shows a version which may have happened based on the plaintiff’s version. That is, the Volvo is occupying (say) the southern kerb parking lane and commences a right turn or U-turn with an impact resulting in the westbound lane. 
         
        
        
         
         5.1 Relative Merits of Versions 
         
        
        
         
         The issues which arise from these versions concern the discrepancies between the ‘witness’ statements versus the described damage to the Volvo and the road markings. Also issues are raised which relate to the impact speed.  
         
        
        
         
         In relation to the damage to the Volvo, if the impact took place as noted in Figure 9 it would be almost certain that scraping would take place all along its right side given the relatively acute angle of this impact. However, statements suggested that a major engagement took place on the right rear corner of the Volvo, indeed deflating the right rear tyre and not marking the vehicle any further. This would suggest a more obtuse angle collision. 
         
        
        
         
         The associated issue involves the  
         pavement marking as noted by the Police 
         . It was suggested that the initial engagement point took place on the westbound lane. It was noted that the various other  
         marks noted on the oncoming eastbound lane 
          appeared to be post-impact marks from metal scraping and so on. 
         
        
        
         
         Therefore, based on the Volvo’s damage description (which suggests an obtuse angle impact) as well as the impact point being on the westbound side, a picture emerges that the Volvo had turned from a portion somewhere further south of the centreline. This is shown in Figure 10. 
         
        
        
         
         Against this, are the statements of  
         various witnesses 
          which unambiguously described the crash as shown in Figure 9. These witnesses would need to be tested, in relation to their unobstructed views. 
         
        
        
         
         5.2 Impact speed 
         
        
        
         
         Some material suggested 
          the motorcycle had accelerated rapidly from the Princes Highway, accelerating through several gears before reaching the area of impact. The involved motorcycle, like a typical modern motorcycle is able to accelerate at extraordinary rates, rivalling that of racing vehicles. From a crash research viewpoint, taking into consideration: 
         
        
       
     · the sideswipe damage to the left of the motorcycle, 
      
       
     · the indentation type damage described to the left rear quarter of the Volvo, 
      
       
     · the absence of scraping towards the front of the Volvo, and most importantly 
      
       
     · the alleged post-impact movement of the Volvo which allegedly involved the driver simply driving ahead into the driveway after impact, 
      
       
        
         
         would combine to mean the impact between the turning Volvo and the motorcycle was not excessive. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         6. Summary and Conclusions 
         
        
        
         
         This crash involved a collision between a westbound Honda motorcycle and a turning Volvo sedan on a suburban collector street in fine daylight conditions. 
         
        
        
         
         As a result of the collision, the motorcyclist received serious and permanent injury. 
         
        
        
         
         Two versions of the crash were reviewed in the material. 
         
        
        
         
         The first version put forward by the driver and  
         various witnesses 
          suggested the Volvo almost came to a stop near the centreline of this collector road in order to make a sharp right turn into a tight driveway. The geometry of this turn was restricted due to the proximity of a utility pole adjacent to the driveway. As the Volvo turned across the centreline, it was allegedly struck on its right rear quarter. 
         
        
        
         
         The alternative version implied suggested that the Volvo was not near the centreline when it made its turn but rather made its turn from either the left part of the westbound carriageway or indeed the kerb on the southern side of the road. This version possibly involved the Volvo performing a U-turn rather than turn right into the driveway. 
         
        
        
         
         It was clear that if  
         one took the witness statements on face value 
         , the driver’s version (the Volvo being close to the centreline) should be accepted. However,  
         various physical evidence did not support this 
         . That evidence involved: 
         
        
       
     · the isolated nature of the damage described to the right rear quarter of the Volvo, suggesting an obtuse angle impact, 
      
       
     · the mark on the westbound side of the carriageway suggesting the motorcycle was on its correct side of he road at the moment of impact. 
      
       
        
         
         Also, there was some  
         discrepancy between the witnessed pre-crash speed of the motorcycle versus the physical evidence 
         . Various witnesses suggested the motorcyclist was travelling at high speed. However some of these estimates relied on noise rather than visually viewing the moving motorcycle.” 
         
        
        
       Events during the defendant’s closing address 
        
       
     48 After the trial judge finished delivering that judgment, the defendant tendered various exhibits, the defendant closed his case, counsel addressed, and judgment was reserved.  
      
       
     49 One further event, however, took place to which it will be necessary to return. It took place in the final address of the defendant against the following background. When, before lunch on 27 June 2001, counsel for the defendant made the application which led to the exclusion of Exhibits B, C, M and N, he did so in carefully chosen language. He did not in terms apply for the “reports” to be excluded. He only applied for the “opinions” not to be accepted as evidence and said “The opinions in these reports are not admissible”. Indeed, at one point he corrected himself by saying “These reports, the opinions expressed in these reports, are not admissible”. If any observer thought that the defendant may have been reserving to himself a right to contend that something other than the opinions in the reports survived the attack on the opinions, that thought received confirmation after lunch. The trial judge dealt with the submission by excluding, not the opinions only, but the totality of the reports. In final address counsel for the defendant contended, according to the trial judge, that he “understood that ruling to relate only to the opinion evidence contained in the reports and sought to rely on parts of Exhibit B as evidence in his case. In part, his submission relied on s 60 of the Evidence Act.” The trial judge rejected the defendant’s submissions for various reasons which she gave in her judgment of 26 July 2001. She might have given another reason, namely, that the argument rested on an inconsistency. Before lunch, counsel for the defendant had drawn attention to the passage in Exhibit B in which Mr Jamieson set out first the defendant’s theory of the accident and then the plaintiff’s theory of the accident. The passage was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The version presented by the witnesses (some evidently independent) involve the westbound Volvo approaching number 8 Station Road on its right, occupying road space close to the centre line, coming to an almost halt. Just as it commenced its turn right into the driveway, the Volvo was impacted on the right rear quarter by an overtaking motorcycle. 
         
        
        
         
         The alternative version implied that the Volvo had not been close to the centreline but rather had been towards the left, possibly near the southern kerb of Station Road, and commenced either a full right turn towards the driveway, or a U-turn. The resultant impact occurred on the westbound lane when the Volvo was straddling the centreline at an obtuse angle.” 
         
        
       
     50 Before lunch counsel for the defendant said of this passage: 
      
       
        
         
         “What Mr Jamieson does in this case is to point out that there are two competing theories as to how this accident happened. If your Honour goes to the exhibit itself on page 14 the expert says this, at the top of the page: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Crash analysis. From the material there appeared to be two basic versions of the crash presented.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Just stopping there, what material? The answer to that is that it’s part or all of the material that is referred to in his document, most of which is not proved and most of which is not before your Honour. He goes on to say this: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘The version presented by the witnesses involved a west-bound Volvo, etcetera, occupying the road space.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         And then in the next paragraph: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘The alternative version implied that the Volvo, etcetera.” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         How is it that your Honour is able to make any judgment about these competing versions which Mr Jamieson sets forth, it’s Mr Jamieson’s analysis of what witnesses are saying in statements which are not before your Honour and which witnesses. Which ones is he relying upon? Is he relying on the police officer who isn’t called and whose statement is not before your Honour? Is he relying upon some other witness whose statement is not before your Honour? Looking at the document itself it’s simply not possible to determine what facts Mr Jamieson relied upon, what facts he weighed and what facts he formed – or what facts formed the basis of his opinion.” 
         
        
       
     51 Though the trial judge did not see the matter in this way, that pre-lunch submission protested too much. A fair reading of the passage in Exhibit B is that the first theory described by Mr Jamieson rested on material which he had quoted on pages 4 and 10-11. On page 4 he quoted from the police “P4 Traffic Collision Report” which was composed by Senior Constable Carney, which listed Mr Norton and Mr Jiminez as witnesses, which no doubt followed an interview with the defendant, and which concluded that the plaintiff was responsible for the accident. That report was in evidence in its own right. On pages 10 and 11 Mr Jamieson quoted at some length from statements made by Senior Constable Carney, the defendant, Mr Jiminez and Mr Norton. Senior Constable Carney’s statement concerned his observations of physical features of the scene after the accident, parts of which arguably supported the defendant’s theory of the case and parts of which supported the plaintiff’s theory according to Mr Jamieson. All of the other three statements remaining in those parts of pages 10 and 11 which had not been rejected on the original tender of the report were favourable to the defendant. It would be tedious to demonstrate by minute textual analysis that every ingredient in the first theory corresponds with what is said in the three eye witness statements quoted on pages 10 and 11, but it is so. These eye witness statements were not in evidence in their own right, and nor was Senior Constable Carney’s statement. Though the trial judge’s reasons for judgment do not identify precisely which parts of Exhibit B counsel for the defendant was relying on in final address, it is very likely to have been the eye witness reports which on their face were damaging to the plaintiff. To have submitted before lunch that Mr Jamieson’s opinions were inadmissible because they were based on material “most of which is not proved and most of which is not before your Honour”, and then to have submitted after lunch that in fact that material was before her Honour because only the opinions had been removed from Exhibit B by reason of the ruling just made, was to have advanced inconsistent submissions. This was magnificent, but it was not war.  
      
       
        
       An evaluation of what happened 
        
       
     52 The course adopted by the trial judge of rejecting four exhibits after initially receiving them, and doing so after the plaintiff had closed his case, must be regarded as a very unusual one. It is a course which could only have been justified if all the objections propounded by counsel for the defendant on 27 June 2001, after the plaintiff’s case had closed, had been foreshadowed on tender of each of the four exhibits and, by consent, reserved for argument until after the close of the plaintiff’s case. Whether events of that kind took place is a controversial question to be examined below. But putting on one side the possibility that they did, the course adopted was adopted only after the following things had happened.  
      
       
        
       (a) When Exhibit A was tendered, counsel for the defendant adopted the wholly orthodox course of saying: “probably now would be as good a time as any for me to make my objections” – that is, “now”, not after the plaintiff’s case closed.  
        
        
       (b) Counsel for the defendant made three objections to specific parts of Exhibit B, all of which succeeded. 
        
        
       (c) Counsel for the defendant objected to Exhibit C only on the basis that it was a reply to Mr Keramidas’ report. When the trial judge eventually rejected Exhibit C on 27 June 2001, though she said the fact that it was a review of Mr Keramidas’ report made it difficult to assess, the actual ground of rejection was that it suffered the same vice as Exhibit B and Exhibit M: “I suspect it too was founded on the same general evidence as exhibit B and M”.  
        
        
       (d) Exhibit M was admitted without any objection at all, either to particular parts or on general grounds. 
        
        
       (e) Exhibit N was admitted without objection, except to one part. The defendant’s perception of the balance as being unobjectionable is highlighted by the fact that one objection to a question in Mr Wingrove’s evidence in chief was that it did not relate to material included in his report, Exhibit N, which suggests that far from the report being inadmissible, it was the touchstone of admissibility. 
        
        
       (f) There was evidence in chief in which the expert witnesses adhered to all (Mr Schnerring) or parts of their reports or gave further reasons for their conclusions. To a large extent this was not objected to. Extensive cross-examination of the three experts took place based on documents they relied on, observations they made and photographs they had taken or seen. Neither the evidence in chief nor the evidence in cross-examination was objected to or rejected at the time on 27 June 2001 when Exhibits B, C, M and N were rejected. It is difficult to follow this oral evidence without recourse to the diagrams and other parts of the reports to which it frequently refers, and if the reports suffered from vices rendering them inadmissible the oral evidence does as well; yet neither the defendant nor the trial judge saw any incongruity in this outcome. Some attempt was made to contend on appeal that the oral evidence was admissible in its own right, but that is questionable: for example, the first answer of Mr Jamieson quoted in [26] above reveals that his oral evidence was based on the same material as his written. In short, if what happened did not go too far, it did not go far enough. For example, if the trial judge were minded to reject Exhibit M in its totality, something should have been done about that part of Mr Schnerring’s evidence in chief in which he adopted the concluding opinion stated in that report and stated that nothing he had learned since his report affected his opinions in it.  
        
       
     53 One reason why the trial judge took the unusual course just described is that the trial itself followed an unusual course. In motor accident cases the plaintiff usually gives evidence first, but here the plaintiff could not give evidence at all. Where possible, in civil cases generally experts who give oral evidence give it last. Often it is not possible, but if this happens, the factual findings which may then arise from the evidence for which the plaintiff contends can be put to the experts as assumptions, and their opinions sought on those assumptions; the factual possibilities for which the defendant may contend can also be put to them, either by the plaintiff or by the defendant, with a view to seeing whether or how far those opinions would alter. Mr Jamieson gave evidence at an unusually early time because he could not give evidence later. The process of putting assumptions in distinct terms to the witnesses in oral evidence or framing the report around assumptions did not happen either with his report or the reports of the other experts. It is to be hoped that the expert reports used in this case do not find their way into the precedent books, because to some extent neither the reports nor any other parts of the witnesses’ evidence in chief were characterised by a clear and distinct indication of what it was they were assuming, what it was they had observed for themselves, and what it was they wished to state, on the strength of those assumptions or personal observations, by way of expert opinion. If the plaintiff has suffered an injustice not capable of correction on appeal as a result of what happened at the trial, it was an injustice which was partly self-inflicted.  
      
       
     54 In summary, there were three deficiencies in what the trial judge did. The first relates to the time at which she did it. The second relates to her failure to deal with, or even refer to, the plaintiff’s primary argument. The third relates to the basis of and extent of her rejection of the evidence. 
      
       
        
       The time of the trial judge’s ruling 
        
       
     55 The moment when the plaintiff’s case closes is one of the most significant moments in a civil trial. 
      
       
     56 If the matter is examined from the point of view, admittedly an unimportant one, of a spectator observing the ebb and flow of a forensic battle, commonly the plaintiff’s case appears at its weakest as the time for closing that case draws near. So far as the plaintiff has control over the evidence desirably to be tendered, that evidence will have been tendered. So far as that evidence is testimonial, it is likely that it will have been damaged by the defendant’s cross-examination and it is certain that it will not yet have been restored by any admissions or other confirmatory evidence which might emerge from testimony called by the defendant if and when the defendant goes into evidence.  
      
       
     57 If the matter is examined from the point of view of the plaintiff, the decision about when the case should be closed turns on an estimation of whether the evidence tendered up to that point will suffice for victory even if answered, or will suffice if not answered in whole or in part. Once a decision is made to close the case as a result of that assessment, it cannot thereafter be revoked. The plaintiff may make considerable progress in cross-examining the defendant’s witnesses, but the defendant may not call any witnesses, or any witnesses who can usefully be cross-examined. The plaintiff can call evidence in answer to the defendant’s case, but only if the defendant does advance a case, and the plaintiff can only do this as of right if the answering evidence is truly in rebuttal. If the plaintiff thinks the case in chief needs bolstering, the case in reply is vulnerable to a charge that the plaintiff’s case is being split, and the plaintiff will have to appeal to the trial judge for favourable exercise of a discretion to permit the plaintiff to reopen the case. The outcome of that appeal is risky and uncertain.  
      
       
     58 From the point of view of the defendant, the moment when the plaintiff’s case is closed makes it necessary to answer particular questions. One question is whether a submission that there is no case to answer should be made. This is a difficult decision, since if the submission fails no evidence can be called by the defendant:  Supreme Court Rules Part 34 rule 8; District Court Rules Part 26 rule 8. Even if the defendant decides not to submit that there is no case to answer but does decide to call some evidence, a decision must be made as to whether or not the plaintiff’s evidence on particular points is such that inferences arising from it may more confidently be drawn if it is not contradicted by a witness available to the defendant.  
      
       
     59 None of the forensic decisions which the parties may have to make just before and just after the close of the plaintiff’s case can be made rationally unless there is some stability and certainty in the evidentiary position at that stage. That is why, as a class, counsel for defendants are rightly rigorous in insisting that counsel for plaintiffs clearly mark the moment when the case for the plaintiff is closed. That is why blithe remarks by counsel for plaintiffs such as “I close my case E and O E”, or “I close my case subject to a few small documentary tenders” excite strong reactions from counsel for defendants, and cause them to demand either that the case be closed unconditionally or that the specific document which the plaintiff wishes to reserve liberty to tender is identified with precision. And that is why counsel for defendants are vigilant about the merit of any claim by a plaintiff to have a case in reply as of right.  
      
       
     60 In at least civil cases tried without juries, if one puts aside evidence admitted only conditionally or de bene esse, or evidence admitted subject to relevance, or evidence admitted subject to specific objection, evidence which has been admitted will generally remain admitted however much subsequent events may damage its weight. That is why debates about admissibility take place at the moment a document is tendered or a question is asked. If it were not so, the court and the parties would be confronted by an ever-changing sea in which items of evidence slither about indecisively with questions about ultimate admissibility hanging over their heads. That would lead to even more uncertainty and confusion, in difficult trials, than that which is inevitably generated by conflicting bodies of evidence the weight of which is hard to evaluate.  
      
       
     61 When expert evidence is called early in a party’s case, and where it is not in satisfactory form, a dilemma arises. Both of these conditions arose in this trial. At one extreme, counsel for the defendant could have objected to particular parts of the reports and permitted the rest to enter the evidentiary material in the case, trusting to the success of arguments in final address based on the inherent weakness of the reports and to his own skill in cross-examination in destroying whatever modest strength they had. At the other extreme, counsel for the defendant could have objected to the totality of the reports on a variety of formal grounds, hoping that if he succeeded, counsel for the plaintiff would not obtain leave to elicit the evidence in classical style by extracting from the witness in chief in non-leading questions what it was that the witness personally observed, what it was that the witness assumed which he did not personally observe, and what, in the light of that material and the witness’s expertise, the witness’s opinions were. Alternatively, counsel for the defendant may have hoped that even if counsel for the plaintiff did obtain that leave, the unexpected nature of the forensic crisis would have made it impossible for counsel for the plaintiff to get the evidence out in its most powerful form.  
      
       
     62 The course actually adopted by counsel for the defendant lay between these extremes. He did object to parts of the reports, and so far as he maintained them he was wholly successful. He did not object to the balance, which meant that the reports were marked as exhibits. He did cross-examine the makers of the reports with considerable skill. But he went rather further. He flagged at the very least an ultimate submission that the reports were valueless for various reasons. Yet his cross-examination tended to give to parts of the written reports an oral foothold in the evidence, just as the questions of counsel for the plaintiff in chief had done with other parts. If the alternative approach had been adopted of seeking rulings on the objections at the outset, it would have been necessary to employ the same policy with the evidence in chief of the witnesses so far as it was given orally, by objecting to opinions not based on identifiable observations or assumptions, and by cross-examining in so discriminating a way as to avoid the written parts of the expert reports achieving some status in the oral evidence. As it was the materials before the trial judge had a broken-backed character: the four reports, having been included at one stage, were out by the end, but a significant amount of oral evidence either adopted them or was difficult to follow without them. A further disadvantage of the intermediate course which the defendant adopted was that it deprived the plaintiff of a chance of mending his hand by curing the deficiencies in the reports. Had the vital application to exclude the evidence been made just before the plaintiff closed his case, he could have made documentary tenders as of right and called new witnesses such as Senior Constable Carney as of right. He could even have recalled earlier witnesses – not as of right, but pursuant to leave which would have been easy to obtain if the interests of justice supported the application and if the defendant were not prejudiced: Brown v Petranker (1991) 22 NSWLR 717 at 728. The defendant would have had difficulty in establishing prejudice in view of the constricted nature of his complaints made two days earlier about the expert evidence. The fact that the vital application to exclude the evidence was made just after the plaintiff closed his case meant that he would have had to have pursued the course of seeking leave to reopen his case. The plaintiff did not pursue that course. It is not clear why he did not, but the reason may lie in the fact that it would have been inauspicious and perilous – much more so than the course of seeking leave to recall witnesses before the plaintiff’s case had closed.  
      
       
     63 There was another intermediate course which the defendant might have taken; indeed he submitted to this Court that he did take it. That course would have been to object to particular parts of the evidence as each report was tendered, but flag the objections ultimately taken successfully after the plaintiff’s case closed, and indicate that if the primary material received into evidence did not match the assumptions on which the experts appeared to be proceeding, then the reports should be excluded. This approach would have required one of several possible steps. One would have been an explicit request to the trial judge not to admit the reports until just before the plaintiff’s case closed. This did not occur. Another would have been to request a ruling that the reception of the reports was conditional on the tender of specified primary evidence. This did not occur either. Yet another, and similar, technique would have been to request a ruling that the admissibility of the reports be conditional on the plaintiff’s undertaking to tender specific primary evidence. This too did not occur. Another possible step would have been to preserve the right to apply, either just before or just after the plaintiff’s case closed, for the evidence which had been admitted to be rejected. It would also have been desirable to couple these techniques with a policy of objection to oral evidence in chief and a policy of self-denial in cross-examination aimed at preventing the oral evidence from remedying the deficiencies of the written.  
      
       
     64 On appeal the defendant in his written submissions did not deal with the proposition that the argument about the admissibility of the exhibits after the plaintiff’s case closed took place too late. It had been flagged in the plaintiff’s written submissions by a reference to the application having been made at “the heel of the hunt”. The defendant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Whether the reports are excluded on the basis of not being relevant or sufficiently relevant under sections 55, 56 and 135 or merely in the exercise of her Honour’s discretion under section 135 does not matter. It is submitted that it was available to her Honour to properly reject the reports … at the end of the appellant’s case when most of the primary material provided to the experts and appears to be the basis of the ‘competing versions’ was not adduced into evidence, thereby leaving no proper factual basis for the expression of any such opinion. To otherwise admit the reports and the opinions into evidence would allow the expression of opinion based on facts not adduced in evidence and not sufficiently identified within the framework of the report to enable her Honour as the trier of fact to be able to identify the factual basis upon which the expression of expert opinion is made. In such circumstances even if the reports were admitted into evidence the weight properly to be given to same would be so little to be of negligible value.” 
         
        
        
       This assumes that it was for the plaintiff after the close of his case to seek to “admit” into evidence documents which had already been admitted, and begs the question of whether it was right for the defendant to seek to have them excluded at that time.  
        
       
     65 In the argument before this Court, which was conducted before a transcript of what happened when Exhibits B and C were admitted early in Mr Jamieson’s evidence on 25 June 2001 had been obtained, counsel for the defendant described the background as being that: 
      
       
        
         
         “the objection taken by [counsel for the defendant at the trial] was first general, and then specific as to certain parts, and her Honour dealt with the specific parts. The general objection was on the basis of the need to prove the underlying facts before they went into evidence, and … the appellant’s counsel … conceded the necessity to prove the background facts. And it’s on that background that one has a better understanding as to how this case was conducted and why the application was made at the end of the plaintiff’s case.” 
         
        
        
       The defendant submitted that the conclusion that that was the background was fortified by the fact that when counsel for the defendant made his successful objection after the close of the plaintiff’s case, counsel for the plaintiff did not protest that it was too late to be making the objection. The account advanced to this Court was based on the recollection of junior counsel, who appeared both at the trial and on the appeal, and was passed on by leading counsel who was not the counsel who had led at the trial. 
        
       
     66 A similar position prevailed in the plaintiff’s camp: there had been a change of leading counsel but not junior counsel. Leading counsel for the plaintiff on the appeal informed the court that the recollection of junior counsel was that no undertaking was given in relation to proof of primary facts and that the four reports were not admitted subject to any undertaking or condition.  
      
       
     67 These different recollections of junior counsel, offered as they obviously were in good faith, are not necessarily inconsistent. However, the defendant’s account of the background, leaving aside for the moment the actual terms of what was said on 25 June 2001 when Exhibits B and C were tendered, does not fully explain the following circumstances: that the trial judge did not say anything about the point which counsel for the defendant was making having been reserved for consideration after the plaintiff’s case was closed; that counsel for the defendant did not open his application by making reference to any right he had earlier reserved to do so; that counsel for the plaintiff during the argument which led to the rejection of the four exhibits said that he had not been “aware as to precisely what application [counsel for the defendant] was to make”; that one of the reports went in without any objection; that another report went in with only three paragraphs objected to and no record of any objection; and that a question was objected to on the basis that its subject-matter was not included in that report. On the other hand, the plaintiff’s account does not explain why counsel for the plaintiff did not protest about the timing of the objection.  
      
       
     68 The transcript of the argument when Exhibits B and C were tendered was procured by the parties after the close of argument in this Court. It is in large measure quoted at [12]-[24]. It reveals that the recollections of junior counsel were not only advanced in good faith, but have some reliability in the sense that each has arguable support in what was said. The reason why the recollections differ lies in the enigmatic quality of the exchanges near the end.  
      
       
     69 Counsel for the defendant started by objecting to what became Exhibit B by complaining of three specific passages. He then complained about the whole of what became Exhibit C, but on specific grounds. One was the ground that it was a joint report: he said the rules did not allow for joint reports and it was impossible to identify which of the opinions in it were Mr Jamieson’s and which were Mr Schnerring’s. He also said the report was a report in answer to that of Mr Keramidas, and was inadmissible until Mr Keramidas’ report was admitted. That concluded the address of counsel for the defendant in chief on the admissibility of the two reports. After counsel for the plaintiff had addressed, counsel for the defendant advanced an entirely new line of attack, but as initially framed it is not clear that it was an attack on admissibility as distinct from weight. Counsel said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The difficulty that the plaintiff is confronted with is that if in truth the primary facts are never established upon which Mr Jamieson’s first report purports to be based then this whole report will ultimately  
         be of no value 
         , it will fall to the ground, and your Honour knows there’s plenty of authority in support of that legal principle. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Jamieson is being called in the absence of any real relevant primary facts. Now, that’s a course that’s entirely open to the plaintiff. My learned friend can call his case any way he wants to, but the risk that he’s now facing is that unless the primary factual material is called then this report will have  
         no probative value 
          and there will be nothing for me to reply to.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
       The submissions in this vein did not appear to go beyond a warning that ultimately the report might lack weight: they did not warn that an application might be made to have it excluded from evidence.  
        
       
     70 The trial judge then raised the possibility of delaying the tender of the two short passages objected to on page 15 and page 16 of Exhibit B until there was an evidentiary basis for them. Counsel for the defendant expressed agreement with that course – presumably in relation to those two passages. Counsel for the plaintiff appeared to suggest a different course, namely that the two passages on pages 15 and 16 should be admitted, but rejected later if the evidence did not support them. At this point the thinking of the participants in the debate may well have diverged. It is possible that senior counsel for the defendant thought he was reserving the right later to have the evidence, so far as it had been admitted, rejected if the underlying factual assumptions were not made good: that would correspond with the recollection of junior counsel for the defendant. It is possible that the trial judge, though not initially of the view that that course was available, came to the view that it was. And it is possible that while counsel for the plaintiff thought that the two offending passages should be admitted subject to later rejection, he did not contemplate the possibility that once the balance of the material was admitted it would be rejected later: that would correspond with the recollection of junior counsel for the plaintiff. At all events, the trial judge did reject those two passages because she said, in a passage in the main transcript of proceedings which is either ill-expressed or ill-recorded, something was “currently not before the court”. But whatever the precise thinking of the participants at the close of the debate, there was not, when the language is objectively construed, any express and clear reservation by counsel for the defendant to himself of liberty to do what he did two days later, namely to apply to have the already admitted evidence rejected. Nor was there any such reservation by the trial judge of liberty to counsel for the defendant to do that. And there was certainly no liberty to do that at a time which could be very prejudicial to the plaintiff, namely after the plaintiff had closed his case. When the trial judge spoke of “how we could delay the tendering of those particular paragraphs of pages 15 and 16”, she cannot have been contemplating that there should be a delay until after the close of the plaintiff’s case. She certainly did not explicitly say so. When counsel for the plaintiff said “if at a later stage it doesn’t live up to the claims then your Honour can make a decision at that time” and when he spoke of there not being a problem about “making something inadmissible down the track or doing whatever your Honour wants to do”, he was probably only talking about the paragraphs on pages 15 and 16. But even if he is to be construed as speaking more widely, he cannot have been contemplating this decision or ruling happening after he had closed his client’s case. He certainly did not explicitly say so. Whether or not there was something to be said for taking the course of reserving liberty to the defendant to make an application of the kind he made, the only rational time for it to be done was before the plaintiff closed his case, not after. Even if there was merit in permitting the defendant to apply after the plaintiff closed his case, that course could not have been justified in this case without consent and unless liberty had been expressly and clearly reserved. Reservation of liberty to pursue so extraordinary a course would call for bluntly explicit language. That language is absent.  
      
       
     71 Even if the concluding part of the debate on 25 June 2001 about Exhibit B and Exhibit C supports the defendant’s position, which it does not, there is nothing equivalent to be found in relation to Exhibit M and Exhibit N. Counsel for the defendant contended that the position for these exhibits was covered by the earlier objection. That inference cannot be drawn in view of the vital importance of the matter, in view of the fact that the transcript records no statement by counsel for the defendant when Exhibit M and Exhibit N were tendered formally renewing his objection and reserving his position, and in view of the fact that Exhibit M was tendered a day after Exhibit B, and Exhibit N was tendered two days after.  
      
       
     72 The defendant in this appeal criticised the plaintiff for failing to have sought leave to reopen his case and call further evidence which might have saved him from his predicament. That criticism does not come well from the party primarily responsible for the plaintiff’s predicament. What happened to the plaintiff was so antithetical to the nature of a modern civil trial that the plaintiff cannot be said to have had due process of law, and that condition of things was not negated by the fact that he could have sought an indulgence in the discretionary favour of the court.  
      
       
     73 In short, the trial judge erred in excluding the expert reports at the time she did, at least without receiving or imposing on the defendant as a condition of acceding to his application that the defendant consent to the plaintiff being able to reopen his case as of right, because, in the absence of a clear agreed understanding in advance that she might do that, the plaintiff was in consequence denied a fair trial.  
      
       
        
       The failure to deal with the plaintiff’s primary argument 
        
       
     74 The primary argument advanced by the defendant during the debate on 27 June 2001 was that Mr Jamieson had examined, and relied on, police and telephone statements from eye witnesses (eg the defendant himself, Mr Jiminez, Mr Norton and Mr Carter); and that so far as they were relied on, the opinions which Mr Jamieson rested on the perceptions recorded in those statements were inadmissible since those statements never entered the evidence. Coupled with this argument was the contention that to a large extent Mr Jamieson had failed to indicate what materials he was relying on. The plaintiff’s primary argument was that though these statements were referred to, they were not relied on as the basis for Mr Jamieson’s opinion. Their role was to lay the basis for the theory of the accident which Mr Jamieson understood the defendant to be contending for, and which he exposed to critical examination by reference to his own theory, the photographs of the road and the vehicles, and descriptions by witnesses of the road and the vehicles. The plaintiff argued in substance: “There are two versions of the accident. One is supported by the driver and various witnesses. The other is supported by the damage to the vehicles and the mark on the western side of the road observed by Mr Nunn. The inferences from the latter material suggest that there are errors in what the witnesses say. But if they do not give evidence, the only evidence will be that which supports the latter theory.” If Mr Jamieson had propounded opinions on the assumption that what the eye witnesses said was right, those opinions would lack any foothold if the eye witnesses did not testify. But he did not propound opinions on the basis of what they said was right. He referred to what they said only to illustrate the theory of the accident which competed with his own. His own theory stood on factual assumptions entirely independent of what those witnesses might say. The force of this submission by the plaintiff is highlighted by the tactic which the defendant employed in final address. 
      
       
     75 It will be remembered that having succeeded, in arguments advanced before lunch on 27 June 2001, in getting the trial judge to remove Exhibits B, C, M and N from evidence, counsel for the defendant in final address submitted that he “understood that ruling to relate only to the opinion evidence contained in the reports and sought to rely on parts of Exhibit B as evidence in his case”. The defendant submitted that so far as Exhibit B contained quotations from the statements of uncalled eye witnesses (including the defendant) which were favourable to the defendant, they should remain in evidence, and the material should be admitted as evidence of the facts asserted pursuant to s 60 of the Evidence Act 1995. The trial judge rejected the submission. Thus the tactic failed. But the fact that the tactic was employed highlights how the material emanating from the absent witnesses was not relied on by Mr Jamieson to support his opinions. Rather he relied on his opinions to cast doubt on the correctness of the material. He was not assuming the facts stated by the eye witnesses to be true in order to state an opinion. Rather he assumed facts appearing from photographs of physical objects or observed those facts, arrived at an opinion as a result, and considered that that opinion showed that some of the “facts” stated by the eye witnesses were untrue.  
      
       
     76 The trial judge does not record the argument which the plaintiff advanced. She did not deal with it. It does not appear to have made any impact on her mind. The argument was directly inconsistent with the reasoning of the trial judge in rejecting the reports. For example, she dealt with pages 4 and 10-11 of Exhibit B in a particular way. It will be remembered that on page 4 Mr Jamieson quoted part of the police “P4 Traffic Collision Report” – a document which was compiled by Senior Constable Carney, referred to Messrs Norton and Jiminez as witnesses, and no doubt had input from the defendant. It will also be remembered that on pages 10-11 Mr Jamieson quoted from a report by Senior Constable Carney about the physical features of the scene after the accident, and from three eye witness statements, none of which were independently in evidence. The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Much of this report is unobjectionable in that it quotes from the materials used, for instance on pages 4 and pages 10 to 11 where there appear extracts from the police report and from statements of five witnesses and police officers. In that they are quotes only, they may be objectionable because they are out of context and incomplete but the quotes could provide the evidence on which the opinion is based and if the statements were put in evidence the quotes and the opinions attached could not be assessed.” 
         
        
        
       Contrary to what the trial judge apparently thought, the P4 material was in evidence in its own right. Further, the trial judge overlooked the fact that she had already rejected the latter half of page 11, being a quotation from a statement of Mr Nunn, on 25 June 2001, so that the relevant material was not “statements of five witnesses and police officers”, but three witnesses and one police officer. But the primary point for present purposes is that the trial judge proceeded on the understanding that Mr Jamieson’s “opinion is based” on the material in “the quotes”. So to proceed was to overlook what counsel for the plaintiff had pointed out: “the quotes” were only the source of a theory which Mr Jamieson rejected, not the source of a theory which he propounded. 
        
       
     77 The argument advanced by the plaintiff on 27 June 2001 was not only not considered by the trial judge, but was valid. If there were any force in the defendant’s contention that the opinions of Mr Jamieson were based on the material he had not clearly identified, that proposition would deserve consideration, but that contention derives no force either from the statements of Senior Constable Carney and the eye witnesses, or any other material supportive of the defendant’s theory of the accident, because Mr Jamieson did not agree with that theory. 
      
       
        
       Errors in the trial judge’s reasoning 
        
       
     78 Confidence in the correctness of the trial judge’s reasoning rejecting the four exhibits on 27 June 2001 is not increased by the fact that it rested in part, as has been seen, on her criticism of evidence she had already rejected on 25 June 2001 (such as the passage on the last half of page 11 and on page 16 of Exhibit B), her criticism of material she thought was not in evidence but which was (the P4 material) and her misconception of what Mr Jamieson was relying on for his opinions and confusion of it with material he was pointing to as the source of the competing theory.  
      
       
     79 Another problem is that the trial judge exaggerated the difficulties of understanding Mr Jamieson’s first report, Exhibit B. In the third last paragraph of her reasons for judgment on that subject, quoted at [46] above, she found various expressions in the report which she placed in quotation marks to be “very general and unspecific”. It is proposed to deal with each of these (apart from the last, which was part of a passage already rejected on 25 June 2001) in categories. 
      
       
     80 Had the trial judge grasped the argument of counsel for the defendant, she would have understood that the references to “witnesses”, “various witnesses”, “some material suggested” and “the witness statements” were all references to the eye witnesses whose statements had been quoted on pages 10 and 11, and would have concluded that a failure to identify them properly, to the extent that pages 10-11 did not do so, did not matter because those materials were not the basis of Mr Jamieson’s opinion.  
      
       
     81 A close reading of Exhibit B would have revealed that the “pavement markings noted by police” (Mr Jamieson’s actual words were “the pavement marking as noted by the Police”) referred to the mark on the road about four inches long in a tear shape, which started shallow at one end, got deeper at the other, looked new, and was observed by Mr Nunn just after the accident. The photographs revealed that that mark was on the western side of the road. It was what is conventionally called a “gouge mark” and what counsel for the defendant in cross-examining Mr Nunn called a “slash mark”. That there was such a mark is incontestable, if only because Mr Nunn was not cross-examined on that point. There was also much other evidence of it. It was mentioned frequently in Mr Jamieson’s report. It was described in Senior Constable Carney’s statement, quoted on page 4, as “a scrape mark … in the westbound lane”. Mr Jamieson himself referred to that mark several times, once as identified in a photograph “of impact area showing mark on westbound carriageway” and as a “painted mark on roadway which possibly was the impact area” (page 13). He also referred to “the mark on the westbound side of the carriageway suggesting the motorcycle was on its correct side of the road at the moment of impact.” 
      
       
     82 The point is that whatever else can be said in criticism of Mr Jamieson, it was tolerably clear what mark he was talking about. Though to some extent he sourced the mark in material not independently admitted, namely Senior Constable Carney’s statement, he also sourced it in a photograph, and Mr Nunn’s evidence, together with much other photographic evidence, gave independent support for its existence.  
      
       
     83 The next expression with which the trial judge had difficulty was “noted marks on the eastbound lane”. (Mr Jamieson’s actual words were: “It was noted that the various other marks noted on the oncoming eastbound lane appeared to be post-impact marks from metal scraping and so on.”) It is likely that this is a reference to marks in the eastbound lane described in Senior Constable Carney’s report, but it does not matter what the reference was to and it does not matter that the existence of the marks was not independently established: Mr Jamieson did not rely on them to support his theory, and excision of that passage would not have damaged either the intelligibility or the force of Mr Jamieson’s reasoning.  
      
       
     84 The next expression which the trial judge found “very general and unspecific” was “However, various physical evidence did not support this”. The paragraph in Mr Jamieson’s report using that expression is: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was clear that if one took the witness statements on face value, the driver’s version (the Volvo being close to the centreline) should be accepted. However, various physical evidence did not support this. That evidence involved: 
         
        
       
     · the isolated nature of the damage described to the right rear quarter of the Volvo, suggesting an obtuse angle impact, 
      
       
     · the mark on the westbound side of the carriageway suggesting the motorcycle was on its correct side of he road at the moment of impact.” 
      
       
        
       That makes it entirely clear what Mr Jamieson was referring to: the damage to the car and the gouge mark.  
        
       
     85 Contrary to the trial judge’s view, Mr Jamieson thus made the material he was relying on in forming his opinion about the accident – the facts he was assuming - tolerably clear. But was there sufficient independently admissible evidence of that material to enable Mr Jamieson’s opinions to remain the evidence? This was an issue to which little attention was given by trial counsel or the trial judge: it was much more significant on appeal. In effect, the key parts of Mr Jamieson’s reasoning, leaving aside his criticisms of the reliability of the eye witnesses whose evidence was never tendered in its own right, and taking into account his knowledge of the general layout of the area, were: 
      
       
        
       (a) the damage to the right rear quarter of the defendant’s car suggested an obtuse angle impact; 
        
        
       (b) if there was a gouge mark on the westbound side of the carriageway and if it had been made during the accident, that suggested that the point of impact was there and that the motorcycle was on the correct side of the road; 
        
        
       (c) the damage to the two vehicles, and the movement of the car after impact, suggested an impact speed as low as 60 kilometres per hour.  
        
       
     86 When assessing the admissibility of expert opinions, it is not the case that an opinion is only admissible if at the close of the case of the party relying on it the evidence establishes each of the assumptions on which it is based on the balance of probabilities. The primary evidence relating to those assumptions might be controversial. Which parts of the primary evidence are to be accepted, and what the correct conclusions from the primary evidence are, are matters for the trier of fact at the end of the trial. The opinion evidence may be admitted if there is evidence which, if accepted, is capable of establishing the truth of the assumptions. On the appeal the defendant put no submission suggesting that the test was more onerous for the plaintiff in this case. For present purposes let it be assumed that it is not less onerous.  
      
       
     87 Was there evidence, at the close of the plaintiff’s case, which, if accepted, was capable of establishing the truth of the assumptions underlying Mr Jamieson’s opinion?  
      
       
     88 The damaged condition of the two vehicles was a matter established by numerous photographs: as to the car, there were seventeen photographs in Exhibit D, twenty-one in Exhibit K and four in Exhibit O. As to the motorcycle, there were nine photographs in Exhibit E, two in Exhibit J, twelve in Exhibit K and two in Exhibit O. (Those two in Exhibit O were part of Mr Jamieson’s report, Exhibit B.) When the defendant went into evidence he tendered a further four photographs of the car (Exhibits 2 and 3) and four of the motorcycle (Exhibits 5 and 6).  
      
       
     89 Further, Mr Jamieson personally inspected the site. Mr Dent gave evidence of the condition of the vehicles. Mr Gosling gave evidence of the scene immediately after the accident. Mr Schnerring inspected the motor car and examined photographs of the motorcycle. Mr Wingrove inspected the site. In all this material there was evidence capable of supporting inferences favourable to the factual assumptions on which Mr Jamieson, and indeed the other two experts, were operating. 
      
       
     90 That leaves the gouge mark. It was clear there was a gouge mark. Mr Nunn said there was. He drew a plan indicating it. He was not cross-examined to suggest that there was no gouge mark. The actual cross-examination of him assumed that there was a gouge mark where he said it was but contended that that was all he saw. And there were photographs of it (eg Exhibit L and Exhibit O). When the defendant went into evidence, he tendered a further photograph of the gouge mark (Exhibit 4). It was not clear when the gouge mark was made, but an inference was open, based on Mr Nunn’s perception that it was recent, that it was caused by the accident. That inference could also be based on an inference that the police officers who attended the accident marked the gouge mark with yellow paint. That is not an inference which any of the experts in terms drew, though Mr Jamieson in his oral evidence in chief made that assumption. While it is true that there is no testimonial evidence, or admissible hearsay evidence, as to why the yellow paint was placed around the gouge mark, by whom, and when, it is not an unreasonable inference that at the scene of an accident being investigated by the police at which a “new” gouge mark was observed, the investigating police officers would be likely to place a yellow paint mark there. The defendant submitted to this Court: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the marking on the roadway inside the yellow paint line was created by the police to indicate a point of impact (as is suggested in the appellant’s case) there has been no attempt to explain how the contents of the P4 report, in particular the diagram, is inconsistent with same.” 
         
        
        
       This is curiously phrased. There was never any suggestion that the mark “inside” the yellow paint lines was created to indicate a point of impact. In the middle of a long answer and just after he was interrupted by an objection, Mr Jamieson referred to “the physical evidence which comprised the marking on the roadway as presumably marked by investigating police – that’s an assumption I made”. Before the objection, he had referred twice to the paint on the road. Plainly by the word “marked” he meant the placing of the paint, and plainly by “the marking on the roadway” he meant the gouge mark. If the submission is meant to commence: “If the marking on the roadway inside the yellow paint line, which paint line was created by the police to indicate a point of impact”, that is not a proposition which Mr Jamieson in terms advanced or assumed. Mr Jamieson did not rely on the placing of the yellow paint around the gouge mark by the police as a decisive assumption in his reasoning: rather he relied on the existence of the gouge mark itself. When in Exhibit B Mr Jamieson used the words “the pavement marking as noted by the Police”, he meant the gouge mark observed by the police, not the yellow paint. It may not be possible to say that the police painted the yellow marking to indicate a point of impact. But the fact that they painted it, if that fact can be inferred, suggests that they thought it had some relevance to the accident. It is true that the contents of the P4 indicate a point of impact on the other side of the centre lines, but the P4 relied on the statements of eye witnesses, including the defendant, and the plaintiff’s experts considered that the objective circumstances suggested some error in the perceptions underlying those statements. It is in those reports, which admittedly were excluded, that there can be found a not unpersuasive “attempt to explain” the matter.  
        
       
     91 The defendant’s argument that a vital ingredient in Mr Jamieson’s reasoning was an assumption that the gouge mark inside the yellow lines indicated the point of impact, and yet there was no evidence that it did, was advanced to this Court but not, so far as appears from the appeal papers, to the trial judge. This gouge mark issue highlights the extent to which there was a concentration before the trial judge on immaterial issues on 27 June 2001. On that day the defendant and the trial judge concentrated on the evidence supporting the theory which Mr Jamieson rejected, not the evidence supporting the theory supported. The gouge mark question also highlights how if the point had been taken in distinct and detailed fashion on 25 June 2001, when Mr Jamieson’s reports were tendered and his evidence in chief given, the parties could have concentrated more on how the gouge mark, and the yellow paint, came to be on the road, when and why. Indeed only general criticisms of the reports were made on 25 June 2001, and even when they became more specific on 27 June 2001, no reference was made to the gouge mark.  
      
       
     92 Of course, it was possible that the plaintiff’s experts had misread the condition of the vehicles and possible that the gouge mark had been made before the accident. It was also possible that they had misapplied their expertise and reasoned erroneously. But these were matters for the ultimate decision of the trial judge. They were not adequate grounds on which to reject the evidence, particularly after it had already been admitted.  
      
       
     93 A further problem with the trial judge’s reasoning turns on the legal test she applied. The trial judge in considering whether to reject the exhibits set out three questions which she said the authorities required to be asked. They were quoted at [44]. She said that the first task was “to assess from the expert reports and from the oral evidence whether [the three experts] had identified the facts they were assuming to be true sufficiently to enable them to be measured against the evidence”. However, she confined her analysis to the expert reports, and did not inquire whether the oral evidence had adequate identification of those facts. It follows from her reasoning that she thought the expert reports did not. That conclusion was criticised above at [74]-[77].  
      
       
     94 All she said about the second question, relating to relevance under s 55, was that the evidence was not relevant. This question did not arise in view of her answer to the first question.  
      
       
     95 She then turned to the third question, which also did not arise in view of her answer to the first question, and excluded the reports. In her judgment of 26 July 2001, she said that her ruling on 27 June 2001 was that the reports “should be excluded pursuant to s 135(a) of the Evidence Act 1995”. She also said that expert evidence could be excluded “because it is not relevant or sufficiently relevant under ss 55, 56 and 135” and that in her ruling she was “concerned about the relevance and reliability of the materials used by the experts in the reports”.  
      
       
     96 These remarks may rest on a conceptual confusion. Evidence which is arguably to be excluded under s 135 is ex hypothesi evidence which is otherwise admissible, and hence is relevant. Section 55(1) provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.” 
         
        
        
       Evidence which is not credible has no probative value at the end of the day, but it may be relevant. That is because in assessing relevance the court has to operate on the basis that the evidence is accepted. However, if evidence, even if accepted, has no probative value, it is irrelevant.  
        
       
     97 The inquiry which the trial judge ought to have carried out in relation to relevance, if she thought it proper to deal with relevance at all as a distinct topic in view of her conclusions about the inadequate identification of assumptions, would have turned on an application of s 55(1) to the circumstances. The inquiry would have to commence by postulating that the evidence was to be accepted, and then examining whether it could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. One fact in issue was the point of impact: two of the plaintiff’s experts placed it on the left hand side of the centre lines, while the particulars of the Defence suggested the contrary, and the eye witness material on pages 10-11 of Exhibit B, which counsel for the defendant contended remained in the evidence even after the trial judge had excluded Exhibit B, placed it on the right hand side. The reasoning of Mr Jamieson and Mr Schnerring might have been right or it might have been wrong, but it did conclude in the plaintiff’s favour on that issue. Accordingly it is hard to see how the trial judge came to conclude that the evidence was irrelevant. Another fact in issue concerned the question whether the path which the defendant intended to pursue was that indicated in Figure 10; if it was, the probabilities of a finding of negligence against the defendant increased. If Mr Jamieson’s evidence were accepted, it rendered findings favourable to the plaintiff more likely. Hence the evidence was relevant from that point of view as well. Indeed, counsel for the defendant in his arguments both on 25 June 2001 and on 27 June 2001 did not contend that the evidence was irrelevant, only that it was of no probative value (on 25 June 2001) and inadmissible for non-statement of assumptions or under s 135 (on 27 June 2001).  
      
       
     98 Turning to the trial judge’s discussion of s 135(a), she found prejudice to the defendant in the need to tender all the evidence referred to in all the reports; in the risk of unproved assumptions being wrongly given some weight or being put to some unforeseen use; and in the difficulty of dealing with the “very general and unspecific references” in Mr Jamieson’s report which was Exhibit B and in equivalent parts of other reports. In her judgment of 26 July 2001 she laid particular stress on the last factor. She said: 
      
       
        
         
         “One of the concerns I had in rejecting the evidence was the difficult position resulting for the Court and the Defendant in identifying and assessing unspecified evidence on which the reports rely. 
         
        
        
       She also said: 
        
        
         
         “Even those parts of the evidence which are first hand suffer from the difficulty that the materials set out in the reports are selections only from possibly larger documents. This deprives the documents of their context and makes them difficult to interpret and less reliable.” 
         
        
       
     99 So far as the last type of criticism is concerned, it has been demonstrated above that the “very general and unspecific references” fall into two categories: references to material supporting the theory of the case Mr Jamieson doubted, and references to material supporting the theory which he and Mr Schnerring favoured. It has also been demonstrated that it is reasonably clear what Mr Jamieson was referring to. Even if the references to the material supporting the theory favouring the defendant were obscure, some endeavour could have been made to excise them while retaining the balance of the reports. The other items of prejudice, so far as they differ from that item, lack reality. The defendant was under no obligation to tender anything; if the plaintiff’s experts’ assumptions remained unproved on the balance of probabilities that would be extremely damaging to the weight of their opinions; and the risk of the material being put to some unforeseen use was curable by appropriate addresses. In short, the trial judge’s s 135(a) reasoning is not convincing.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion on Ground 1 
        
       
     100 In my opinion Ground 1 is made out.  
      
       
     101 On the hearing of the appeal, the plaintiff accepted initially that the only realistic order to be made was an order for a new trial. Later he contended that if one took into account the evidence which the trial judge had admitted and the evidence which she ought not to have rejected, together with the paucity of evidence called by the defendant, there should be a verdict for the plaintiff. That submission must fail. One reason why it must fail is that counsel for the defendant appearing on the appeal forcefully advanced arguments based on an analysis of certain photographs comprising Exhibit L for questioning the validity of Mr Jamieson’s opinion as to the probable point of impact. Precisely how powerful those arguments are is difficult to evaluate, because, although the photographs had been available to the defendant, shown to Mr Nunn, marked for identification during his evidence, used in cross-examination of him in some detail, and tendered during Mr Gosling’s evidence (ie after Mr Jamieson had left the witness box but before Messrs Schnerring and Wingrove entered it), they were never put to the plaintiff’s experts at the trial with a view to obtaining their views on the arguments in question. The fact that the photographs were not put to the experts suggests that the issue of where the point of impact was loomed much larger on appeal than it did at the trial, and more precise criticisms of the expert evidence at the trial might profitably have isolated this as a crucial issue earlier. However this may be, it cannot be concluded on a balance of probabilities that even if the plaintiff’s experts are correct in their theory of how the accident happened, the defendant was negligent. That was a real possibility flowing from their theory, but it is appropriate that the facts be properly examined at a new trial conducted in the light of all admissible evidence and with a sound perception of the issues involved. Yet another consideration is that there was some evidence of contributory negligence in the form of speeding. This Court could not easily arrive at a conclusion on that issue, and a new trial would be needed to deal with it. A new trial limited to contributory negligence is highly inappropriate.  
      
       
     102 This Court is obliged not to grant a new trial unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned to the plaintiff. The defendant contended in effect that his case was so strong that there was no miscarriage of justice and that a new trial would be futile. He relied on the argument based on the photographs referred to above. As was indicated, the strength of that argument is difficult to estimate. He relied on the lack of direct evidence in relation to the gouge mark, and that point has been dealt with. He pointed to the contradiction between the experts’ assumptions as to the point of impact being at the gouge mark and the diagram in the P4, which placed it across the centre lines. However, the P4 was in another respect criticised by Mr Jamieson on reasonable grounds; the persons on whose observations the P4 was based did not enter the witness box; and one of them, the defendant, had a very strong interest of his own to serve in what he said to the police, and a knowledge that the plaintiff was unable to contradict him, at least immediately: as things have turned out, that inability proved permanent. Further, though the P4 was tendered by the plaintiff, if he had not tendered it, he would have had good prospects of preventing the defendant from tendering it by reason of the operation of ss 63, 64, 69(3) and 135 of the Evidence Act. The defendant also pointed to what he said was a contradiction between Mr Jamieson (who said the angle of impact between motorcycle and car was obtuse) and Mr Wingrove (who said it was acute). The trial judge seemed to find this evidence contradictory as well. There was, however, no contradiction. Mr Wingrove said it was not a T-bone collision (ie one in which the angle of impact of motorcycle and car was at or near 90 degrees), but was one with a lower angle of impact. This he called “an acute angle type impact”. Mr Jamieson’s opinion was not inconsistent with this. Mr Jamieson said the angle of impact was “greater than 45 degrees which defines an obtuse angle impact”. 
      
       
     103 The case of the plaintiff, unassisted as it is by his own evidence, may or may not be powerful, but it cannot be said that the outcome of a second trial would inevitably be the same as the first.  
      
       
     104 The trial judge’s discussion, in her reasons for judgment of 26 July 2001, of the expert evidence was unsatisfactory. She said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no direct evidence of the accident. Experts called for the Plaintiff estimated the speed of his motorcycle at impact to be between 60-100kph, but their estimates were not based on independent calculations. A yellow marking on the road surrounding a gouge in the bitumen was interpreted as a police marking of the site of some contact with the road by the Volvo or motorcycle. This was one of the principal reasons for the experts’ assessment that the impact had occurred on the left hand or ‘correct’ side of the road. The P4 report, probably adopted by the RTA report prepared by Mr Dent, suggested the collision occurred on the other side of the road. Those reports stated the Plaintiff had crossed the double lines to overtake the Volvo. The other evidence supporting the Plaintiff’s case that the collision occurred on the left hand side of the road related to the angle of impact of the motorcycle and the Volvo. Two of the three experts said this was an obtuse angle suggested from the confined area of the damage to the Volvo. The third expert, Mr Wingrove, accepted that the damage to the Volvo may have indicated an acute angle of impact, but he thought the damage to the motorcycle was not necessarily consistent with such an impact. I find this evidence inconclusive and insufficient to discharge the Plaintiff’s onus of proof.” 
         
        
        
       She did not, however, say that Mr Wingrove, like Mr Jamieson, fixed the collision on the left hand side of the road. She did not discuss why the experts’ opinions were propounded. Since at the time the experts gave evidence in chief counsel for the plaintiff was operating on the assumption that the report or reports of each expert were in evidence, and since substantial written material explaining their positions was withdrawn by reason of the court’s ruling after they left the box, it is not surprising that there was no satisfactory discussion of the expert evidence. There is no ground of appeal contending that the trial judge failed to comply with the duty to give reasons. But the reasons which were given reveal that it cannot be assumed that the outcome would have been the same had the ruling excluding the evidence not been made. There was a miscarriage in that the trial judge disabled herself, by an erroneous decision to reject the four exhibits, from considering the totality of the plaintiff’s case and understanding the detail of the experts’ reasoning. That case was significantly stronger with the reports than without because they contained a much more detailed exposition of the experts’ position than their oral evidence in chief.  
        
        
       Other grounds 
        
       
     105 In view of the plaintiff’s success in relation to Ground 1, it is not necessary to consider the other grounds of appeal. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     106 The following orders are proposed. 
      
       
        
       1. The appeal is allowed. 
        
        
       2. The verdict and orders of the trial judge in favour of the defendant are set aside. 
        
        
       3. There is to be a new trial on liability. 
        
        
       4. The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal. 
        
        
       5. The costs of the proceedings in the District Court to date are to be in the discretion of the trial judge conducting the new trial. 
        
        
       6. The defendant is to have a certificate under the  
       Suitors’ Fund Act 
        if qualified. 
        
       
     107 PEARLMAN AJA:  
      
       
       Introduction 
        
       On 24 November 1996 the Appellant’s motorcycle collided with the Respondent’s motor vehicle in Station Road, Albion Park. The Appellant suffered injuries and brought a claim in the District Court alleging that the Respondent caused the collision by his negligence. The quantum of damages was agreed between the parties and the only issue for determination was the question of liability.  
       
     108 In a judgment delivered on 26 July 2001, Gamble ADCJ held that the collision did not involve any negligence on the part of the Respondent and her Honour entered a verdict for the Respondent. The Plaintiff now appeals from that decision.109 It was common ground in the court below and in this Court that, immediately before the collision, the Appellant was riding his motorcycle in a westerly direction along Station Road. The Respondent had also been travelling in a westerly direction along the same road, and, immediately before the collision, the Respondent was in the course of executing a right hand turn into the driveway of No 8 Station Street. The Appellant’s motorcycle collided with the Respondent’s Volvo at a point in the vicinity of the rear wheel on the driver’s side of the Volvo. 
      
       
       The grounds of appeal 
       
     110 In essence, the Appellant’s grounds of appeal are as follows:(1) The trial judge erred in rejecting the written reports of experts called in the Appellant’s case;  
      
       
     (2) Whether or not the experts’ written reports were admitted in evidence, the trial judge erred in concluding that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the Respondent. 
      
       
       The experts’ reports and the course of the trial 
       
     111 The Appellant tendered four written expert reports. The first two were those of Mr J R Jamieson, a consultant engineer with Jamieson Foley & Associates Pty Ltd, dated respectively 1 December 1998 and 9 June 2000. According to the transcript of the hearing, objections were taken to the tender of each report, but the transcript available at the hearing in this Court was incomplete as to the precise nature of those objections. Accordingly, the Appellant was directed by Sheller JA, the presiding judge, to furnish after the hearing a more complete transcript. I will return to what is revealed in the fuller transcript in due course, but suffice it to say at this stage that each of these reports was admitted unconditionally and marked as ex B and ex C respectively.112 Mr F W Schnerring, also a consulting engineer with Jamieson Foley & Associates Pty Ltd, compiled the third report. No objection was taken to its tender, and it was admitted into evidence as ex M. 113 The fourth report was that of Mr C J Wingrove, a transport engineer. According to the transcript, objection was taken to its tender, and, after legal argument, it was admitted into evidence as ex N with pars 5, 6 and 7 struck out.114 All three experts were called to give evidence in the Appellant’s case, and they were extensively cross-examined on their respective reports by Mr Stitt QC, who was appearing on behalf of the Respondent at the time.115 At the close of the Appellant’s case, Mr Stitt made an application to have each of exs B, C, M and N excluded on the ground that the basis for each of the respective opinions in those reports had not been proved on the evidence and that as a consequence the probative value of each of the reports was outweighed by their prejudicial effect. 116 After a short adjournment to consider the application, the learned trial judge delivered an ex tempore judgment in which she exercised her discretion to exclude all four reports pursuant to s 135 of the Evidence Act (NSW) 1995. Section 135 provides as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         135  
         General discretion to exclude evidence 
          
         The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
          
         (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; or 
          
         (b) be misleading or confusing; or 
          
         (c) cause or result in undue waste of time. 
         
        
       
     117 Her Honour dealt extensively with ex B, finding that many parts of it were not based on evidence extracted in the report or on material identified as having been used but not appended to the report. In particular, her Honour found that two hypothetical versions of how the collision occurred prepared by Mr Jamieson (and to which I refer later) were not based on specified evidence. She went on to identify the same faults with each of the other exhibits, and, on the basis that they each contained essentially unfounded opinion, she rejected each of them as being unfairly prejudicial to the Respondent.118 The Respondent’s case was then presented, which consisted of the tender of a number of photographs, after which counsel addressed, and her Honour reserved her decision. In her reserved judgment, her Honour returned to the question of the admissibility of the four written reports. It appears that she did so in order to deal with a submission of Mr Stitt that the four reports should not be excluded in their entirety, that only the opinion evidence contained in them should be rejected, and that the Respondent should be entitled to rely on other parts of the reports pursuant to s 60 of the Evidence Act. Her Honour rejected this submission, and the four reports remained excluded.119 In her reserved judgment, her Honour traversed the evidence before her, excluding, as she had earlier ruled, the four expert reports. In particular, she noted the P4 Traffic Collision report, which showed the Volvo turning across double lines and the motorcycle colliding with it on the eastbound, or “wrong”, side of the road. She noted also the oral evidence from the experts called by the Appellant, and, in particular, Mr Jamieson’s view that the Volvo had commenced its turn into the driveway from somewhere to the driver’s left. Ultimately, she made what she described as “findings of fact”. She noted the conflicting evidence as to how the collision occurred, namely, that some evidence supported a finding that the impact had occurred on the left hand or “correct” side of the road, and other evidence supported a finding that the collision occurred on the other side of the road. She noted that two of the three experts expressed an opinion that the angle of impact was obtuse, and the third expressed the opinion that it was an acute angle. She also noted the uncertainty of the evidence about the estimated speed of the motorcycle at the impact. Ultimately, her Honour said: “I find this evidence inconclusive and insufficient to discharge the Plaintiff’s onus of proof. I am not satisfied that the Defendant did anything to cause the collision between him and the Plaintiff”. (RAB p 35 – 36) 
      
       
        
       The competing claims in this Court 
       
     120 On behalf of the Appellant, Mr Toner SC submitted that an objection to the admissibility of the totality of the reports should have been taken at the outset, and if successful, presumably no oral evidence from the experts would have been received. But once the oral evidence was received, it made it unsatisfactory to exclude the written reports. He pointed out that each report had been served in time, that the opportunity to cross-examine the experts about them had been fully taken, and that, had the reports remained in evidence, the Respondent could have called for those of the underlying documents which were not tendered and could have led evidence about the contents of the reports, in particular, about the two hypothetical versions of the collision. 
      
       
     121 In his written submissions, Mr Toner also claimed that the discretion under s 135 ought not to have been exercised. Mr Toner relied in this respect on Quick v Stoland (1998) 87 FCR 371, contending that the reasons there advanced by Branson J for concluding that the discretion ought not to have been exercised paralleled the position in this case. However, Mr Bartlett SC, appearing for the Respondent, sought to distinguish Quick v Stoland on the basis that, in that case but not in this case, most of the essential material on which the relevant opinion was based had been in evidence. I agree with this submission. Mr Jamieson compiled a long list of the material that he had examined. Most of it was not in evidence in the proceedings. In particular, the police statement of the eyewitness was not tendered, nor were other statements made to the police, nor was the statement of one of the investigating police officers. Mr Schnerring relied upon the same material, and, in addition, directed his attention to the report of a traffic engineer, Mr Keramidas, which also was not tendered. Mr Wingrove also relied on the same material.  
      
       
     122 A point which illustrates the lack of foundation evidence is the question of the painted yellow mark on the roadway. It had been observed on the roadway by Mr M T Nunn, an off-duty police officer who was a friend of the Appellant and who attended the scene of the collision after it had occurred. The yellow mark was also evident in some of the photographs. Mr Jamieson believed that mark to have been placed there by the police as possibly indicating the impact area, and he used this fact as one of the physical indicators of how the collision occurred. But there was no evidence about who placed it there and for what purpose. 
      
       
     123 The opinions expressed by Mr Jamieson, Mr Schnerring and Mr Wingrove were of little value unless the facts upon which those opinions were based were proved (Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at pars 64 – 86). It was clearly open to the learned trial judge to conclude that, in the absence of the material and evidence I have mentioned, the assumed facts that underpinned the respective opinions in the reports had not been proved.124 Mr Bartlett submitted that no prejudice to the Appellant could have resulted from the course that the trial took, because each of the experts furnished oral evidence as to their respective reconstructions of the collision. Thus, Mr Jamieson explained at length his view as to how the accident happened and in particular asserted that the impact occurred at an obtuse angle. Mr Schnerring agreed with that opinion and Mr Wingrove also dealt with the angle of impact. In particular, some of the oral evidence was directed to specific identifiable parts of the written reports and accordingly, in his submission, those parts were incorporated into the evidence, despite the rejection of the actual reports. Thus, Mr Jamieson specifically adverted to figure 10 depicted in ex B as demonstrating the impact geometry and Mr Schnerring expressly adopted par 2 of his report. 
      
       
       The admission of the expert reports 
       
     125 At first I had formed the impression that her Honour’s discretion had miscarried when she rejected the four expert reports. I felt that Mr Terracini SC, who was then appearing as counsel for the Appellant, had conducted the Appellant’s case under the impression that each of the reports had been unconditionally admitted into evidence and that their later rejection after the Appellant’s case had closed left the Appellant in a disadvantageous and unfair position. However, the fuller transcript reveals that not to be the case.126 Mr Stitt had objected to certain parts of ex B and to the whole of ex C on the basis that the latter was simply a rebuttal of the report of another expert which was not in evidence. However, he also couched his objection in broader terms. As to ex B, the transcript reveals that Mr Stitt said: 
      
       
        
         
         The difficulty the plaintiff is confronted with is that if in truth the primary facts are never established upon which Mr Jamieson’s first report purports to be based then this whole report will ultimately be of no value, it will fall to the ground … My learned friend can call his case any way he wants to, but the risk that he’s now facing is that unless the primary factual material is called then this report will have no probative value and there will be nothing for me to reply to … 
          (T 25 June 2001 p 3 – extract of legal argument) 
         
        
       
     127 In response, Mr Terracini said: 
      
       
        
         
         … if at a later stage it doesn’t live up to the claims then your Honour can make a decision at that time but in the meantime you will have Mr Jamieson’s evidence … There’s no problem under the Evidence Act of ruling something inadmissible later on down the track or doing whatever your Honour wants to do … 
          (T 25 June 2001 p 4 – extract of legal argument) 
         
        
       
     128 This exchange puts to rest my concern that the Appellant’s case was conducted under a misapprehension that there was no likelihood that the expert reports would ultimately be rejected. Mr Stitt outlined that risk in plain terms, and Mr Terracini accepted it. It is true that the submissions were made in relation to ex B, but they were based on general principle and they must be taken to apply equally to all the expert reports. I turn then to consider the evidence contained in the expert reports and given in oral evidence. 
      
       
       The evidence in the expert reports 
       
     129 Two of the expert reports were particularly important so far as regards the critical issue in the case, namely, the question of whether the Respondent was negligent. They were ex B and ex M.130 In ex B, Mr Jamieson proffered two hypothetical versions of the collision. The first, which he sketched and called “figure 9”, was based on statements from witnesses, including an eyewitness. This version described the Volvo as commencing its turn close to the centre line of the roadway and the collision occurring on the eastbound or “wrong” side of the road. The eyewitness was not called to give evidence at the trial and his statement was not in evidence. However, Mr Jamieson concluded that figure 9 was not supported by the physical evidence. Taking into account in particular the obtuse angle of impact, and the yellow paint mark on the roadway, Mr Jamieson adopted an alternative version, which he sketched as “figure 10”. This version suggested that the Volvo commenced its turn from the left part of the westbound carriageway or from the kerb on the southern side of the road and that the collision occurred on the westbound or “correct” side of the road.131 Mr Jamieson did not conclusively adopt either version, but recommended that the evidence of witnesses upon which figure 9 was based “should be tested in the light of the physical evidence which contradicts their statements”.132 Mr Schnerring put forward the following conclusions in his report (ex M): 
      
       
        
         
         Figures 9 and 10 of Mr Jamieson’s report of 1 December 1998  
         (the reference is to ex B) 
          showed two versions of the crash involving Jason Rhoden … an examination … of the photographs of the damage to the motorcycle strongly supports the version of the crash shown in Figure 10 of Mr Jamieson’s report. Damage to the Volvo and to the motorcycle does not support the version of the crash shown in Figure 9 of Mr Jamieson’s report. 
          
          
         The damage to the two vehicles involved in the crash supports the view that the Volvo sedan was turning from either the left part of the westbound lane or from the road shoulder on the southern side of the road, and that Jason Rhoden was passing the Volvo near to the centreline but on the correct side of the road at impact.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The oral evidence 
       
     133 In relation to his opinion as to how the collision occurred, Mr Jamieson made the following statement in giving evidence in chief: 
      
       
        
         
         That means nearer 90 degrees rather than zero degrees, or should I say, greater than 45 degrees which defines an obtuse angle impact. Combined with the paint mark left on the roadway, it appeared that the Volvo commenced to turn right into a driveway but most relevantly it appeared to turn right not from near the centre line of the road but rather from somewhere to the driver’s left as he was proceeding along … 
          (T 25 June 2001 p 15) 
         
        
       
     134 This evidence was illustrated by figure 10, which showed the “swept path” of the Volvo commencing from the left part of the westbound carriageway. In further evidence in chief, Mr Jamieson explained that figure 10 “was plotted to represent the impact geometry as suggested by the physical damage to the respective vehicles and the mark on the road” (T 25 June 2001 p 17). Mr Jamieson was extensively cross-examined about figure 10 and what it depicted.135 Mr Jamieson’s cross-examination concluded as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. And is it accurate to say that really the whole of your first report, which is exhibit B, was to set forth on the information which was then available to you, what was in essence two competing theories about the point of impact and the way in which the collision occurred? 
          
         A. Yes. Yes. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         Q. And the reason that you were unable to come to any concluded view in that report was because, as you said, it depends upon which factual version was ultimately accepted? 
          
         A. And what further physical evidence became available. 
          
          
         Q. So would it be fair to say that your first report, exhibit A  
         (sic) 
          is a report which is to some extent an interim report and a report which merely sets forth competing versions of point of impact and cause of collision? 
          
         A. I think it goes slightly beyond that, but I couldn’t disagree with that general proposition. 
          (T 25 June 2001 p 59 - 60) 
         
        
       
     136 In giving oral evidence, Mr Schnerring did not repeat in terms the two paragraphs expressing his conclusion that I have quoted above. The only direct reference to them occurred in examination in chief, where he was asked, apparently in reference to the second paragraph – “Do you adhere to paragraph 2 of that report?” He replied: “Yes, I do.” (T 25 June 2001 p 82). In cross examination, he was asked whether the account given in the eyewitness statement set out in Mr Jamieson’s report was consistent with the damage to the Volvo, and he rejected that proposition. He was also asked if he agreed that the point of impact was at an acute angle, and he rejected that proposition also. 
      
       
       Conclusion 
       
     137 The trial judge had a discretion to exclude evidence under s 135 of the Evidence Act, and she had a discretion to do so although the evidence had already been admitted. (Peacock v The King (1991) 13 CLR 619 at 634; Reg v Burns (1883) 9 VLR 191 at 195 - 196). Her Honour excluded the evidence in circumstances where it had been foreshadowed early in the trial (before the experts had given oral evidence) that one of the expert reports might later be excluded on the basis that the assumed facts upon which the expert had based his opinion had not been proved. The Appellant’s counsel acknowledged that possibility and accepted that her Honour had power to take the course she ultimately did. The fact that this circumstance related to only one of the four reports that were excluded does not alter the position as regards the other three reports. The most important report was ex B, but the submissions made by counsel applied equally to the other three reports. 
      
       
     138 The conclusion that I have reached on this aspect is that her Honour did not err. It was open to her to reject the expert reports in the manner that she did. But it clearly would have been preferable to admit those reports provisionally on the basis that evidence would later be admitted as a foundation for the assumed facts upon which the opinions were based (cf s 57 Evidence Act). This would have made it clear beyond doubt to the parties, especially to the Appellant on whose behalf they were tendered, that the expert reports were at risk of ultimate rejection. 
      
       
     139 Furthermore, in par 121 - 123 I have explained my conclusion as to why it was open to the trial judge to find that the assumed facts upon which the expert opinions had been based were not proved, and hence to exercise her discretion to exclude the expert reports under s 135 of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
     140 Nevertheless, despite the exclusion of the reports, the principal opinions of both Mr Jamieson and Mr Schnerring were given in oral evidence (for whatever their value, in the absence of proved basal facts). Their opinion as to the circumstances of the collision were graphically illustrated in figure 10, which was referred to, especially in the examination in chief and the cross examination of Mr Jamieson. Her Honour had had the opportunity of seeing figure 10, but it could have done no more than assist her Honour in understanding Mr Jamieson’s oral evidence as to how the collision occurred. It was not determinative of or different from his opinion, and its exclusion could not have been critical. 141 There was conflicting evidence about how the collision occurred, about whether the angle of impact was obtuse or acute, and about the speed of the motorcycle. Furthermore, Mr Jamieson had made it plain in giving his oral evidence that his opinion was subject to confirmation on the facts as proved. It was her Honour’s duty to determine whether the evidence, taken as a whole, demonstrated, on the balance of probabilities, negligence on the part of the Respondent. She discharged that duty and her decision should not be disturbed. 
      
       
     142 For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

      Regina v Ned BIKIC 
      
      
       
        
       The appellant was charged with murder of Y and U. He was found not guilty of the murder of Y but guilty of his manslaughter, and guilty of the murder of U. The victims were shot in an affray at a house in Bankstown. The Crown contended that the appellant and eight other men were at the house with rope and guns waiting to ambush Y and U. When they arrived, the affray broke out and Y and U were killed. The appellant appealed against the convictions on six grounds. 
        
        
       Grounds 2 and 2A – Directions as to joint criminal enterprise 
        
       These grounds were concerned with what had to be contemplated by the appellant as a possibility in the context of a joint criminal enterprise in order that he be criminally responsible for the killings of Y and U. The appellant submitted that it was necessary that he contemplated killings amounting to murder and that a direction to that effect was required. The direction was not required. It is not required where there is agreement to do an act and there is no reason to distinguish between criminal responsibility for an act which is agreed and criminal responsibility for an act which is contemplated as a possibility in carrying out a joint criminal enterprise. The appellant also submitted that it was necessary that what the appellant contemplated be more than a risk he could dismiss as negligible, and that a direction to that effect was required. On the facts that did not arise and the direction was not required. 
        
        
       Ground 3 – Defences of self-defence and provocation 
        
       Whether these defences should have been left to the jury as to the killing of U depended on whether there was a real possibility that the jury might reach a view on the facts that would leave open an arguable case of self-defence or provocation. Considering that U’s gun had not been fired, U had no defence injuries and U was set upon by eight men who had been waiting in ambush to restrain him and tie him up, the trial judge was correct in not leaving the defences to the jury. 
        
        
       Ground 5 – Assistance to jury on the drawing of inferences 
        
       A direction to the jury that guilt must be the only rational conclusion is no more than an amplification of the rule that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. There is no overarching requirement to give a direction of this kind, and in the circumstances, the directions given by the trial judge were sufficient. 
        
        
       Ground 6 – Whether convictions unreasonable 
        
       The appellant submitted that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was present at the scene of the crime, as the evidence of the witness M was compromised and inconsistent with other evidence. The jury were properly warned, and M’s evidence was confirmed in many ways. On examination of the evidence as a whole, it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
        
       Ground 1 – Further evidence and fresh evidence 
        
       The appellant called evidence from a number of witnesses that they did not see the appellant at the scene on the night of the murders, and some gave evidence that another man was involved who could have been mistaken for the appellant. The appellant submitted that even if this was not fresh evidence, it established a miscarriage of justice. 
        
        
       In accordance with  
       Ratten v The Queen 
        (1974) 131 CLR 510, the court decided whether it believed the evidence, and acting on that belief and its own view of the evidence at the trial, whether it was satisfied that the appellant was innocent or whether there was such doubt as to his guilt that the verdicts of guilty could not stand. The court did not believe the evidence. The court then decided whether the evidence in whole or in part was or was to be regarded as fresh evidence, and whether it had the quality required of fresh evidence before it would ground a successful appeal. The evidence was not and was not to be regarded as fresh evidence, and even if it were, it followed from the lack of credibility of the witnesses that a reasonable jury was not likely to believe it.  
        
        
       Doubt was expressed as to the dual approach in accordance with 
        Ratten v The Queen 
       . In case the understanding of  
       Ratten v The Queen 
        was in error, the ultimate question of miscarriage of justice was addressed, and it was held that no miscarriage of justice had been established. 
        
        
       Orders 
        
       Appeal dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GILES JA: The appellant was indicted on two counts of murder. By the first count it was charged that on 5 April 1998 at Bankstown in the State of New South Wales he murdered Orhan Yildirim. By the second count it was charged that on 5 April 1998 at Bankstown in the State of New South Wales he murdered Mehmet Unsal.  
      
       
     2 The trial before Hidden J and a jury began on 7 March 2001. On 14 May 2001 the appellant was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter on the first count and guilty of murder on the second count. On 6 July 2001 he was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment until 5 September 2016 with a non-parole period to expire on 5 September 2011. 
      
       
     3 The appellant appealed against the convictions. He did not appeal against the sentences. 
      
       
     4 The grounds of appeal as filed were - 
      
       
        
         
         “1. A miscarriage of justice was caused by the absence at the trial of evidence to be adduced on the appeal. 
          
          
          2. The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury as to the elements of the offence of murder. 
          
          
          3. The trial judge erred in failing to leave the defence of provocation to the jury in respect of the death of Mehmet Unsal. 
          
          
          4. The trial judge misdirected the jury regarding the evidence as to the reputation of Mehmet Unsal and Orhan Yildirim. 
          
          
          5. The trial judge erred in failing to provide any assistance to the jury in respect of the drawing of inferences. 
          
          
          6. The convictions are unreasonable.” 
         
        
       
     5 By the hearing of the appeal the submissions in support of ground of appeal 3 had taken up the defence of self-defence in addition to the defence of provocation. At the hearing of the appeal ground of appeal 4 was abandoned and a further ground of appeal was added; it can conveniently be regarded as ground of appeal 2A, and was - 
      
       
        
         
         “2A. The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury as to the elements of the offence of manslaughter.” 
         
        
        
       
     6 Yildirim and Unsal were shot in an affray at 71 Allum Street, Bankstown (“the premises”) on the evening of 5 April 1998. On the Crown case, the appellant and eight other men went to and were at the premises to ambush Yildirim and Unsall, taking guns and rope with which to tie them up; when Yildirim and Unsal entered the premises, there was the affray ending in their deaths. The other men were Raymond Curry, Goran Mackic, Mark May, Carl Mullany, Satuala (Nance or Nances) Nanai, Zeljko (Steve) Nitrovic, Russell Oldham and Arben (Benny) Puta. 
      
       
     7 The appellant underwent an earlier abortive trial. He and six of the other men were charged with the murders of Yildirim and Unsal, and went to a joint trial before Hidden J and a jury commencing on 3 April 2000. The six men were Curry, Mackic, Nanai, Nitrovic, Oldham and Puta. May and Mullany received indemnities against prosecution and gave evidence for the Crown. On 13 June 2000 the appellant was discharged from the joint trial. The joint trial continued in relation to his former co-accused, and all were found guilty of murder or manslaughter.  
      
       
     8 At the appellant’s separate trial he formally admitted a number of matters, including that Curry, Mackic, Nanai, Nitrovic and Oldham went to the premises on the evening of 5 April 1998; that Puta was present when they arrived; that Yildirim and Unsal then entered the premises; that there was a violent struggle; and that Yildirim and Unsal were shot and killed. May and Mullany again gave evidence for the Crown, in which they admitted their presence at the premises and their participation in the affray. The killings of Yildirim and Unsal, and the general participation of the appellant’s former co-accused and of May and Mullany, were common ground.  
      
       
     9 The Crown contended that the appellant also went to the premises and participated in the affray. The Crown did not assert that the appellant had shot either Yildirim or Unsal; on the Crown case, the appellant was criminally responsible for the murders of Yildirim and Unsal as a party to a joint criminal enterprise in pursuance of which the killings occurred. The case was left to the jury as one in which the central issue was whether the appellant was present at the premises at the time of the killings, and the jury was instructed that he should be found not guilty if they were not satisfied that he was present. It was expressly stated in the appeal that “the Crown case was never put on the basis of [the appellant] being anything other than present at the premises”.  
      
       
     10 May did not know the appellant and did not identify him as a person present at the premises on the evening of 5 April 1998, although he gave a description of a man who went to the premises and participated in the affray whom the Crown suggested was the appellant. Mullany did know the appellant, and identified him as a man going to the premises and participating in the affray. None of the appellant’s former co-accused gave evidence at the appellant’s separate trial.  
      
       
     11 The grounds of appeal were of three kinds: first, errors in the trial judge’s summing-up in relation to questions other than the central issue (grounds of appeal 2, 2A, 3 and 5); secondly, unreasonable verdicts with particular reference to the central issue (ground of appeal 6); and thirdly, miscarriage of justice in the light of further evidence.  
      
       
        
       The evidence in outline 
        
       
     12 In the two month trial there was a great deal of evidence. In the way the appeal was conducted, it is not necessary to canvass it all in detail. What follows is against the background that the appellant’s formal admissions included - 
      
       
        
         
         “3. The premises at 71 Allum Street, Bankstown were, as at 5 April 1998, residential premises and they were leased to Arben Puta and were the residence of Arben Puta and other persons. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The persons Steve Nitrovic, Raymond Curry, Goran Mackic, Russell Oldham and Satuala Nanai on the night of 5 April 1998 travelled with others from the 777 Café in Goulburn Street, Sydney to Bankstown stopping on the way at Central Avenue, Marrickfille. The persons travelled in two motor vehicles, a red Falcon registration number TKA 407 and a black BMW registration number 777 888. The red Falcon was driven by Nitrovic. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The two vehicles, the red Falcon and the black BMW, arrived at Bankstown at approximately 9.30 pm on 5 April 1998 and parked in Bower Street, Bankstown. 
         
        
        
         
         6. The occupants of the two vehicles then walked together to 71 Allum Street where they entered the premises. 
         
        
        
         
         7. When they entered the premises, Arben Puta was present. 
         
        
        
         
         8. After a period of time Puta left the premises. 
         
        
        
         
         9. At about 10.20 on 5 April 1998 Unsal and Yildirim entered the premises and a violent struggle ensued. Unsal and Yildirim were shot and died.” 
         
        
        
       
     13 The admissions also included that the Ford was registered in the name of Nitrovic’s mother and that the BMW was registered in the name of Mercrest Pty Ltd and was available for the appellant’s use.  
      
       
     14 The premises were a small suburban dwelling. A hallway ran from the front door into a combined lounge room and kitchen/dining area at the rear of the premises. The hallway was a little wider for approximately the front half of its length than for the rear half, and it did not run straight from the front door to the entrance to the lounge room but had the rear half off-set to the right as one passed down the hallway from the front door by about half a metre. On the right as one passed down the hallway from the front door were doorways to three bedrooms, which became known as bedrooms 1, 2 and 3. The doorway to bedroom 1 was a little before the offset and the doorway to bedrooms 2 and 3 were after the offset. The doorway to bedroom 3 was near the entrance to the lounge room. On the left as one passed down the hallway from the front door were a doorway from the attached garage, before the offset and almost opposite the doorway to bedroom 1, and just after the offset a doorway to the bathroom opposite the doorway to bedroom 2. A linen cupboard on the offset faced the front door, between the garage doorway and the bathroom. 
      
       
     15 The hallway was about five and a half metres in length and quite narrow, a little over a metre wide for the front half and a little less than a metre wide for the rear half before the entrance to the lounge room.  
      
       
     16 When the police attended Yildirim’s body was lying in the hallway adjacent to the doorway to the garage. His feet were near the linen cupboard and his head was towards the front door. He had been hit twice on the head, the wounds being consistent with being hit with the butt of the Ruger automatic pistol later mentioned, and had been shot seven times. A bloodstain pattern indicated that Yildirim had been dragged a short distance from nearer the front door. Nitrovic’s blood was found on the wall of the hallway outside bedroom 1. 
      
       
     17 Yildirim had been shot in the back, although the track of one of the wounds was downwards and consistent with him being bent over facing the person firing the gun. Some of the wounds would have been received when Yildirim was not upright, perhaps when he was falling down. At least three of the wounds were from the Ruger automatic pistol, the bullets from that gun being found in his body. At least one of the wounds was from another gun, possibly the Smith & Wesson revolver later mentioned. From deposits left on and in Yildirim’s clothing and his wounds, the guns had been very close or close (up to 600 mm) to Yildirim when fired. As well, there were holes in or damage to Yildirim’s shirt, without corresponding wounds. One bullet had grazed his collar as if fired at Yildirim whilst he was facing the person firing the gun, and another had passed through his shirt in a manner indicating that his shirt had been pulled away from his body as if in a struggle. 
      
       
     18 Yildirim had a knife in his right hand when found. The DNA analysis matched Yildirim’s profile. 
      
       
     19 Unsal’s body was lying in the hallway outside the doorways to bedrooms 2 and 3, with his feet towards the front door and his head towards the entrance to the lounge room and approximately a metre from that entrance. There were two areas of bruising to his head, consistent with being hit with the butt of the Sportco rifle later mentioned, and he had been shot twice, in the head and neck: the neck wound would have brought immediate death. The gun which caused the head wound was fired from up to 450 mm away, and the gun which caused the neck wound was at one point said to have been fired from up to 150 mm away and at another point from up to 600 mm away. A bullet fired from a Ruger revolver was found in the lounge room, having struck the door jamb of bedroom 2 and been deflected into that room, and the neck wound was probably from this bullet. A bullet hole was found in the floor beneath Unsal’s head, but the bullet was not found. Unsal had no defence injuries. 
      
       
     20 A number of guns were found in and in the vicinity of the premises.  
      
       
     21 A Ruger automatic pistol was found in a garden bed in Bower Street some distance from the premises. A swab taken from the gun and subjected to DNA testing matched Nitrovic’s DNA profile, described as a profile occurring in 1 in 750,000,000 in the general population, and Nitrovic’s clothing had residue consistent with proximity to firing a gun. Six spent cases from the Ruger automatic pistol were found in the hallway of the premises. Apart from the bullets in Yildirim’s body, one bullet was found embedded in the floor in the hallway near the front door, one bullet passed through the floor near the front door and was found in the under-floor cavity, and the sixth bullet was not found.  
      
       
     22 A Ruger revolver was found in the lounge room. All five bullets in its chamber had been fired, and three bullets were found. One was the bullet which probably caused Unsal’s neck wound. Another passed through the linen press into the bathroom, having first been deflected from its normal axis of flight: the deflecting contact could have been with many things, including a person or item of clothing. Another bullet passed through the linen press door.  
      
       
     23 A Smith & Wesson revolver was found in a garden bed near the front door of the premises. Four of the six bullets in its chamber had been fired. One bullet was found on the carpet towards the front of the hallway. Some pieces of copper jacket were found in the under-floor cavity near the front door, either part of a single bullet or parts of two different bullets. The other bullets were not found.  
      
       
     24 A Glock automatic pistol was found on the grass verge of Braunbeck Street some distance from the premises. It was registered to Unsal, and a case found in the top pocket of Unsal’s coat had been fired from it, although it could not have come from a firing at the time. An unfired bullet for the Glock automatic pistol was found in another of Unsal’s pockets. When the Glock automatic pistol was found two bullets were jammed in the magazine, although at least one shot already in the chamber could have been fired before the gun jammed: there was no evidence that a shot had in fact been fired. A swab taken from this gun and subjected to DNA analysis matched the profile of Nitrovic. There was no gunshot residue on Unsal indicating that he had fired a gun.  
      
       
     25 A sawn-off Sportco rifle was found in the hallway not far from Yildirim’s body. Its magazine held seven bullets. No fired bullet cases or bullets were found in the premises. A box of identical bullets was found on the top of a cupboard in the lounge room. The box when unopened contained 50 bullets. It had been opened, and contained 43 bullets.  
      
       
     26 As well as the fatal wounds to Yildirim and Unsal, others were wounded in the affray.  
      
       
     27 Mullany was wounded in the right hand. The gun which fired the bullet was not identified.  
      
       
     28 Mullany gave evidence of Nitrovic shouting that Yildirim had a knife, that Yildirim was “thrashing wildly” with what appeared to be a knife, and that Nitrovic appeared to have been cut and “crumpled back” against a wall. A treating doctor gave evidence that Nitrovic had two stab wounds in his right arm and two in his left leg. The appellant’s formal admissions included that Nitrovic was wounded in the affray and was then taken by Curry to Liverpool Hospital. 
      
       
     29 Mullany also gave evidence that as he, May and Oldham ran out of the premises Oldham said “I am cut” and was holding his side. May gave evidence that the man who must have been Oldham said he had been shot. There was evidence that when examined in November 1998 Oldham had lesions consistent with a bullet wound to the chest and a tangential bullet wound to an arm. 
      
       
     30 Mullany gave evidence that Nanai had blood around his shoulder area at one point in the affray. There was evidence that when examined in November 1998 Nanai had a lesion on his right shoulder estimated at three to four months old. 
      
       
     31 Puta was shot in the right thigh. The bullet was not found and the gun from which the bullet was fired was not identified, but the gun was fired at a close distance.  
      
       
     32 Trails of blood led from the premises to the street and surrounding streets, and there was evidence of blood on clothing. By DNA analysis -  
      
       
        
       (a) Mullany’s blood was found on Yildirim’s trousers; 
        
       
       
       (b) blood found on Puta’s T-shirt mostly matched the DNA profile of Unsal, but some of it matched the DNA profile of Mullany; 
        
        
       (c) blood found on Puta’s jeans matched the DNA profile of Nitrovic; and 
        
        
       (d) blood found on Puta’s shoes matched the DNA profiles of Unsal, Nitrovic and Mullany.  
        
       
     33 May and Mullany gave evidence of distribution of rubber gloves to the men and Mullany gave evidence of distribution of rope. Lengths of rope were found beneath Yildirim’s leg, in the bathroom and in the sink, and a coil of rope was found on the dining table from which the lengths appeared to have come. Rubber gloves were found in and outside the premises. A glove found in bedroom 3 showed DNA which could have been that of Mullany or Nanai. A pair of gloves found in Glassop Street carried blood matching Mullany’s DNA profile. Other gloves or pieces of gloves were found in and around the premises and in the surrounding streets. The appellant’s formal admissions included that the Ford was located by the police and contained Mackic’s mobile telephone and a box of Ansell rubber gloves, and that the box bore two of Nitrovic’s fingerprints. The rubber gloves were sold in boxes of fifty, and the box as found had 33 gloves. 
      
       
     34 The appellant was one of the lessees of premises in Goulburn Street, Sydney at which there was conducted the 777 Café. His close friend and business associate Tony Vincent was another lessee. They were the proprietors of the café. The stopping-place at Central Avenue, Marrickville on the way to Bankstown was Vincent’s home. The appellant’s formal admissions included that the appellant had been acquainted with Curry for about two years, with Mackic for about three years, with Nitrovic for about 15 or 16 years and with Puta for about 15 years, all before April 1998, and that as at 5 April 1998 Mullany was capable of recognising the appellant. They also included that Curry, Mackic, Nitrovic and Oldham were acquainted with each other; that Curry was acquainted with May, Mullany and Nanai; that Nitrovic was acquainted with Mullany and Puta; and that Mackic was acquainted with Mullany, all prior to 5 April 1998. Vincent also knew the appellant’s former co-accused, with the exceptions of May and Nanai, and as to some was a long-standing friend.  
      
       
     35 May and Mullany gave evidence of events prior to the affray itself, as well as of the affray. 
      
       
     36 May was a cousin of Curry, and was close to him. He had known Nanai for about three years, and Nanai was at his home when he received telephone calls from Curry. After the telephone calls May went in Curry’s car with Curry, Nanai and a man identified only as Colin to the 777 Café. On the way to the café they picked up Mullany. May said that he believed Curry “wanted us to go out with him. That was it, to probably go out, maybe just be with him.”  
      
       
     37 Curry, May, Mullany and Nanai were dropped at the café, and Colin took the car away. May and the others were introduced by Curry to “everybody” in the café, and took a seat at a table in a back corner.  
      
       
     38 May described some of the people in the café. Two men were playing pool, from the descriptions being Mackic and Oldham. There was also “an older guy with long hair” (“the older guy”): this is the man whom the Crown suggested was the appellant. May’s description of the older guy was - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. This older guy with long hair, how old would he appear to be to you? 
          
         A. Say late 40’s. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you tell me anything else about his appearance? What about his height for example? 
          
         A. About the same height as me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you describe in more detail his hair? 
          
         A. Shoulder length black hair. Shoulder length black hair and that’s about it. Nothing really striking about it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now when you say shoulder length, can you tell us what you mean by that? 
          
         A. Hair that comes down to about here (indicated) all the way round here (indicated) so quite long. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You are touching your left shoulder? 
          
         A. Yes, just about here (indicated) 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You indicated your left shoulder with your right hand? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         NICHOLSON: And then he went back to his right shoulder and left shoulder and said “all the way round here”, that is what the witness demonstrated. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: That is right. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Are you able to say what the texture of the hair was? 
          
         A. Black straight hair. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had you ever seen this person before? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What was this person doing when you saw him? 
          
         A. He looked like he was running the cafeteria. People were coming in and he was serving them.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     39 May was about 5 feet 9 inches in height. In cross-examination May repeated that the hair of the older guy was straight and dark, and said that it was down to his shoulders, and “not thick” and “thin”. He agreed that it was “the sort of hair that would be taken by two hands and pulled around the head and put in a ponytail”. He also said that the older guy was fair skinned and “wasn’t dark or olive. He was Caucasian”, and was slimmer in build than the others. May had been shown an array of 20 photographs, amongst which was a photograph of the appellant, and had been asked to say if he recognised or identified anyone. He had not picked anyone. The photograph of the appellant had been taken at the time of his arrest in November 1988, when his hair was short. 
      
       
     40 To diverge for a moment from May’s evidence, the appellant gave evidence. He said he had asked Curry, in context after May’s evidence as to the older guy was known or anticipated and it was appreciated that the Crown case included that the older guy was the appellant, who the older guy was. He said that Curry had said that the older guy was a friend of Nitrovic and Puta; that he asked Nitrovic and Puta who the older guy was, and that they had declined to tell him, “No they never want to discuss between themselves even”. He said that Nitrovic and Puta “knew who this person definitely they knew”, that he had not found out from them, and “I been intending to call them but I get legal advice they explain who it was”.  
      
       
     41 Returning to May’s evidence, after about fifteen minutes Curry told May to follow him into the back room of the café. There was no one else there. Curry gave a bundle of money, about $1,000, to May, saying it was “just for coming here”. May said - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. When he said that to you, what did you understand your task would be by ‘being there’? 
          
         A. I actually thought it was something, believe, I thought actually something was going to happen at the cafeteria, I thought, when he picked us up I thought there must be something going on at the cafeteria, I thought also must have been a fight happening at the cafeteria or something. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You thought there was going to be a fight at the cafeteria, was there? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did you do with the money? 
          
         A. Put it in my pocket. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where did you go once you had done that? 
          
         A. I went back and sat at the table.” 
          
         
        
       
     42 May said that he saw Mullany and Nanai also go into the back room with Curry and return.  
      
       
     43 About twenty minutes later a man “came up to us and told us where to go”. From May’s description the man was Nitrovic, as appears to have been accepted at the trial, and I will hereafter refer to him by name. May accompanied Curry, the older guy and another man to a dark blue or black two door sports car, and believed that Mullany, Nanai and “whoever was left at the cafeteria” went to a different car. The sports car must have been the BMW. Curry drove, May sat behind him, the older guy sat beside May in the back seat, and the other man sat in the front passenger seat. When asked about the other man in cross-examination May said he was able to say only that he was aged about 30; he had seen him in the café. 
      
       
     44 Curry drove to a street in Marrickville. During the journey the older guy produced a small hand gun, which was passed around and admired. There was talk in the car, although May could not remember saying anything. He tried not to look at the older guy because he wanted to keep to himself. He did not think that the older guy had an accent. 
      
       
     45 The Ford was at the street in Marrickville, and May saw a number of men sitting on a brick fence. Mullany and Nanai were amongst them. He joined the men, as did Curry and the older guy. May, Mullany and Nanai remained sitting on the brick fence, the other men were “sort of milling around and talking amongst themselves with Raymond”. A bag containing rubber gloves and maybe some surgical tape was produced, and the gloves were handed around. May put them on.  
      
       
     46 After a time the men went back to their cars. The occupants of the BMW were as before. They drove to a place in Bankstown. The two cars stopped together. Someone said, “Take off your jewellery”, and May saw Mullany “taking or maybe taking off a watch or something like that”. The group of men included Curry, May, Mullany, Nanai and the older guy. They walked to the premises and went in the front door. May saw at the premises another man whom he believed to be the owner and to be named Puta.  
      
       
     47 May, Mullany and Nanai sat at the dining table in the kitchen/dining area, and the other men were “just milling around the living room”. May marked the positions of the men on a plan of the premises, including the older guy sitting on the lounge. Nine men in all were marked, including “home owner” which must have been Puta. Nitrovic approached May and his companions, and - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Can you tell us what he said? 
          
         A. He said, I know what he said to me, he said ‘Not to worry. This is a pay back’. He had been threatened before. Someone had put a gun to his head, was going to kill him, and all he wanted us to do was restrain him, hold him down. That is about it.” 
         
        
       
     48 May saw “some guns being handed around” by the cupboard in the lounge room. The only person he saw actually receive a gun was Nitrovic: it looked like an automatic silver pistol. Another gun looked like a cut down small rifle, and May thought there was a third gun. May heard Puta say, “’No guns, no guns, no shootings.’ Something to that effect.” After the guns had been handed out he heard Puta say, “I go get them. I go get them.” Puta walked towards the front door in the company of the older guy. May did not see either of them again. 
      
       
     49 Nitrovic broke the men up into groups. May and Nanai went into bedroom 3. After a little while Nitrovic came into the bedroom, and “he told us to grab the big guy. That he will be coming in first and that he’s got a gun.” Nitrovic also said, either before the men were separated into groups or to May and Nanai in bedroom 3, something like, “There is going to be no shooting. It’s only if they shoot.” May said he thought that Nitrovic “was just saying that to try and calm us down.”  
      
       
     50 The lights in the premises went out. After five or ten minutes May heard “some knocks on the front door”, and 20 or 30 seconds later some people walking down the hallway talking. He said - 
      
       
        
         
         “The lights went on. I heard someone, don’t know if they are the exact words but think I heard someone say ‘grab them’. Rushed out behind Nance because he was standing in front of me, down the hall say 20 [sic: ?2] metres, 8 feet away, looked like a bit of a scuffle, a bit of fighting. I just grabbed the nearest person facing me. I grabbed him from around the waist. I spun around. I was now facing a wall. A split second later I heard ‘bang, bang, bang’. I sort of froze for a sec. I spun around and saw what looked like one bloke lying on the ground and looked like another bloke over the top staggering. I jumped over him, grabbed the door. It was not locked, it was open, and I run out the door.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     51 This was amplified. The man May grabbed was near the linen cupboard, and May’s back was towards the front door. May marked the position of the man he grabbed on a plan. When he grabbed the man there were other men around, but he did not know what happened to them. The man must have been Unsal, since the man lying on the floor over whom May jumped must have been Yildirim. May heard “like six loud bangs, really loud bangs” and coming from behind him, that is in the direction of the front door, and heard something whistle past him which he thought was a bullet. There were other men in the area, “it seemed quite a few people around there”. The man standing over the man lying on the floor was Nitrovic. May was followed out the front door by three other men. From May’s descriptions two of the men were Mackic and Oldham, as appears to have been accepted at the trial, and again I will hereafter refer to them by name. The third man was Mullany. May had not seen Mullany since going into bedroom 3: when he went into bedroom 3, Mullany was at the dining table. 
      
       
     52 May said he thought that the man standing over the man on the floor (Nitrovic) had been shot, because he looked injured and was bent over. In cross-examination he said that Unsal was still “on his feet and alive” when he (May) released him. He said he thought Oldham said he had been shot, and that Oldham was bleeding from a shoulder wound: May gave his T-shirt to Oldham. As May was running down the street he saw that he had blood on his hands and was no longer wearing his gloves. 
      
       
     53 It is not necessary further to detail May’s evidence of what happened after he left the premises.  
      
       
     54 Mullany said that he was picked up by Curry, after a telephone call, at about 7 pm on 5 April 1998. May and Nanai were in the car, and were known to him. Also in the car was a person introduced as Colin.  
      
       
     55 Curry drove to the 777 Café, where the car was parked and its occupants entered the café. Mackic was there, and was already known to Mullany, and another man introduced himself as Russell. Mullany sat with May and Nanai. Mullany gave evidence - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Whilst you were at this table did anybody else come up to you? 
          
         A. Yeah, a person I know as Steve came over. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. This person Steve, had you met him previously? 
          
         A. Yes, I had. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In what circumstances? 
          
         A. Also I met him through Ray; I think the first time I met him was when I was working at a King Cross hotel. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see anybody else there? 
          
         A. Ned was also there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you refer to Ned, who do you mean? 
          
         A. Mr Bikic. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had you met Ned Bikic previously? 
          
         A. Yes, I had. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you tell me the previous occasions you had met him; where that was? 
          
         A. Yeah. Again, I met him first through Ray; I had been out to dinner with him on one occasion that I can remember. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where had you seen him? 
          
         A. I had seen him at DCM nightclub. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had you seen him anywhere else? 
          
         A. I had seen him at the coffee shop as well. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How many times on previous occasions to this particular evening we are discussing had you seen Ned at the coffee shop? 
          
         A. Probably two or three times. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had you observed any particular position he seemed to occupy there? 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see what he did there when you were there on some previous occasions? 
          
         A. Yeah. One time I was there he gave me a coffee and some bag of chips I think. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. On this evening of 5 April 1998 did you see Ned at any time with Ray? 
          
         A. Yes, I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see where they went or what they did? 
          
         A. Yeah, I saw them talking outside on the footpath.” 
         
        
        
       
     56 Elsewhere in his evidence Mullany described what the appellant looked like that night; his description was - 
      
       
        
         
         “I would say in his 50’s, quite slim, and he had sort of medium wavy hair, it was a bit longer at the back, it hung down the back with little curls, his complexion was a bit rough.” 
         
        
        
       A photograph of the appellant close to this time showed him with fairly lengthy hair, described at one point in the appeal as a mullet. Mullany said that the appellant had a thick accent. There was other evidence that the appellant was just under 6 feet tall. 
        
       
     57 Curry took Mullany into the back room. The appellant was there. Mullany greeted the appellant, who greeted him back. Curry said to Mullany, “There is $600 dollars there for a standover job. It’s easy money.” Mullany agreed, and was given one of a number of piles of money on the table. He returned to where he had been sitting. He saw Mackic, May and Nanai go separately into the back room with Curry.  
      
       
     58 In cross-examination Mullany agreed that in the committal proceedings he had said that he had not seen the appellant before going into the back room with Curry. He said that he was probably confused. 
      
       
     59 Mullany then saw Curry talking to the appellant. Curry said to Mullany, “Okay, let’s go”, and told Colin to take the car home. Curry, Mackic, Nanai, Nitrovic, Oldham and Colin left the café. The appellant was still in the café when Mullany left. In cross-examination Mullany agreed that in the committal proceedings he had said that the appellant had already left the café when he (Mullany) left. Curry told Mullany, “You go with Steve”.  
      
       
     60 Mullany followed Nitrovic to the Ford. Nitrovic sat in the driver’s seat. Mullany sat behind him, with Mackic and then Nanai to his left in the rear seat, and Oldham sat in the front passenger seat. The BMW pulled alongside. In it were the appellant in the driver’s seat, Curry in the front passenger seat, and May in the rear seat.  
      
       
     61 The cars drove off. Nitrovic drove the Ford to Newtown, where he stopped near an Amcal chemist. There was a question at the trial and in the appeal over whether, in saying in his evidence that the Ford did not follow the BMW to Newtown, Mullany had contradicted what he had told the police in a statement: I will return to this. Mackic left the car, and returned with an Amcal chemist bag.  
      
       
     62 Nitrovic then drove to Marrickville. The BMW was already there. May, Mullany and Nanai sat on a small brick fence, and Mullany saw Curry and the appellant standing talking on the footpath. He saw Vincent come out of the house and engage Curry and the appellant in conversation. He himself exchanged hellos with Vincent. 
      
       
     63 Curry came over to Mullany and his companions sitting on the brick fence. May “asked him why there were so many guys and what we were getting involved in”. Curry replied, “It’s just a standover. We want this done quickly and quietly , no noise because of the neighbours.”  
      
       
     64 The men returned to their cars. Mullany saw Curry get into the driver’s seat of the BMW, and said that the appellant sat in the front passenger seat and May sat in the rear seat. There was no one else in the car.  
      
       
     65 The cars drove to Bankstown, where the men got out. Curry had a cardboard box in his hands, and from it gave a pair of rubber gloves to Mullany and told him to put them on. There was evidence indicating that the box of gloves had been purchased from the Newtown chemist. Some of the men did put gloves on, Mullany thought the appellant was one who did. Mullany did not put the gloves on at that time, but put them in his pocket. Curry also told Mullany to take his jewellery off, and Mullany did so and put his jewellery and his wallet in the BMW. The men walked to the premises and went in the front door. The door was opened by a man who was introduced to Mullany as Benny; he identified him from photographs as Puta.  
      
       
     66 Mullany went into the lounge room and sat on the lounge. May and Nanai sat with him. Curry, Mackic, and Oldham were there, and he saw Puta speaking to the appellant. Curry “was probably the most active, he was moving between most of the parties”. He saw one of the group of Mackic, Nitrovic and Oldham take a box of bullets from a bag on top of the cabinet in the lounge room.  
      
       
     67 Curry came over to May, Mullany and Nanai. He said, “I want this done quickly and quietly, no noises because of the neighbours. Once on the ground I want you three to walk outside calmly.” Mullany put his rubber gloves on, and saw that “at that time everyone had their gloves on too”. He heard someone say, “gag them and tie their hands, no noise”, and Nitrovic say, “Benny will go and get them.” Puta left the lounge room.  
      
       
     68 A mobile phone rang, and somebody said, “They’ve arrived.” Nitrovic said, “There will be a warning knock and then they will come in.” Curry then told May, Mullany and Nanai that “there was to be two guys, one was larger and one was smaller. He said to Nance and Mark, ‘You guys take the first guy to the house from the third bedroom.’” Mackic produced some nylon rope and said “Gag them, tie their hands”, and demonstrated with the rope. Mullany was given a length of rope.  
      
       
     69 Curry told May and Nanai to go into bedroom 3, and they did so. Mullany went into bedroom 2 with Curry. Curry said to him, “You, Steve and Goran are to take the second guy into the house” and “the others will get them from the front”. Mullany saw Nitrovic and Mackic go into the bathroom. 
      
       
     70 After about ten minutes Mullany went out of bedroom 2 to the entrance to the lounge room. He saw the appellant sitting on the dining table accompanied by Curry and Oldham. He spoke briefly to Curry, then went back into bedroom 2.  
      
       
     71 After about five minutes there was a knock on the front door, and about two minutes later the front door opened. The only lights on were the lights in the lounge room. Mullany saw what he thought was a person pass the doorway to bedroom 2. He heard a loud thud from the direction of bedroom 3. He went out into the hallway. Looking towards bedroom 3, he saw “Like movement of like three bodies like I could see Nances and what I presumed was the first person into the house and also it appeared that Mark was there too”; he said, “It was like they were wrestling.” Nanai had some blood around his shoulder area. Mullany looked towards the front door and saw “the second person enter the house, at about the doorway to bedroom 1”. Nitrovic and Oldham were near him. He marked on a plan the positions of the various persons. It showed Mullany outside the doorway of bedroom 2 and towards the front door, the second person nearer the front door at the doorway to bedroom 1 with Nitrovic and Oldham close to him and near the linen cupboard, and the first person at the end of the hallway near the entrance to the lounge room with May and Nanai on each side of him. 
      
       
     72 The second person was “thrashing his arms about” and seemed to have “some sort of metal object in his hand. Nitrovic “appeared to be cut and he was screaming ‘He’s got a knife. He’s got a knife.’; he sort of was holding himself and he crumpled back against the wall.” Mullany lunged at the second person and went to punch him.  
      
       
     73 Mullany heard “a sound like a gun shot coming from behind me”, and thought that something hit or grazed his arm; in fact he suffered a graze wound to his hand. He turned in the direction of Nitrovic and saw Nitrovic standing firing a pistol in the direction of the second man. He heard other gun shots. The second man fell towards the floor. Nitrovic was still firing into that man. The man and Nitrovic were facing each other. 
      
       
     74 Mullany heard other gun shots, “It seemed like they were coming from the direction of the lounge room but it was like gun shots were going off everywhere at that time.” He turned towards the lounge room, and - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. When you turned what did you see? 
          
         A. I saw the first victim into the house was also lying on the ground. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see anybody else down there? 
          
         A. Yes, I saw Ned and Ray. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where was Ned? 
          
         A. Standing in the hallway just before it goes into the lounge room. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did Ned have anything? 
          
         A. He appeared to have something in his hand. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did he have in his hand? 
          
         A. I couldn’t say exactly, it was hard to tell, but he had something in his hand. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Are you able to describe say shape or size? 
          
         A. Yes, it looked to be quite straight in shape. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you tell us its length? 
          
         A. I would say probably 20 to 30 centimetres. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where, relative to that man on the ground or on the floor, was Ned? 
          
         A. He was standing near the man’s head. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What about Ray, where was he? 
          
         A. He was standing alongside Ned. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who was the closest of Ned and Ray to the man’s head?  
          
         A. Neither, they both appeared to be the same. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The same distance from the head? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see anything in Ray’s hands at that time? 
          
         A. No, I didn’t, no.” 
         
        
        
       
     75 Mullany said that the object the appellant was holding appeared to be “like a dark metal object” and “a weapon of some type”. The man near whose head the appellant and Curry were standing had his feet closer to Mullany. 
      
       
     76 At the time Oldham “was pretty much standing alongside myself”. Mullany did not see where Mackic, May or Nanai were at that time. Then he saw May alongside him in the hallway. May said, “Let’s get out of here”, and May, Mullany and Oldham ran out the front door.  
      
       
     77 Oldham “was carrying what appeared to me to be a sawn off shotgun or was quite a long type of rifle or something”, and said “I’m cut” and appeared to be holding his side. As he was running some distance from the premises Mullany saw Mackic also running, and said that Mackic was carrying a small pistol. Mullany took off his gloves and dropped them in the gutter.  
      
       
     78 Mullany said that, apart from Yildirim and Unsal and the appellant, Curry, Mackic, May, Nanai, Nitrovic, Oldham, Puta and himself, no one else was at the premises that evening. 
      
       
     79 Again it is not necessary to detail Mullany’s evidence of what happened after he left the premises.  
      
       
     80 Mullany was cross-examined at some length to confirm that the man at whom he saw Nitrovic shooting, who must have been Yildirim, was facing Nitrovic, and to elicit that Mullany did not see May or Nanai in the vicinity of where Nitrovic was shooting Yildirim. He was cross-examined to the effect that he was making up his evidence of the appellant’s presence and participation in order to receive favourable treatment from the authorities, which he denied, and I will return to this also.  
      
       
     81 Residents in Allum Street, Bankstown and surrounding streets gave evidence of the cars arriving and men getting out, of men running from the premises, and of other such matters: none of this evidence went directly to the appellant’s presence and participation in the affray.  
      
       
     82 Telephone records from mobile phone carriers and land line operators in respect of calls made to or from mobile and home telephones of the appellant, various of his former co-accused and others were admitted and tabulated. There were many calls between the appellant and Nitrovic, Oldham, Puta and Vincent, and from the appellant to the 777 Café, in the few days preceding 5 April 1998. There were calls on 5 April 1998 from Nitrovic to the appellant, Curry, Mackic and Puta, including from Nitrovic to the appellant’s mobile phone at 5.31 pm, and there was a call from the 777 Café to the appellant’s home at 6.30 pm on that day. There were calls from the appellant’s mobile phone through a relay tower close to the café to Vincent at 7.54 pm and 7.56 pm on that day. There were calls from the appellant’s mobile and home telephones to Mackic and Vincent in the early hours of 6 April 1998, to Vincent in the early morning of that day, and a little later to a solicitor, who went to Nitrovic at Liverpool Hospital.  
      
       
     83 In his evidence the appellant denied any knowledge of Yildirim and Unsal and any involvement in their murders. He said he had not seen Curry, May, Mackic, Nanai, Nitrovic, Oldham or Puta on 5 April 1998. He denied ever serving customers at the 777 Café, and said that it was managed by Vincent’s son Seamus Vincent. He gave an account of his movements on 5–6 April 1998 which included that he had lost his mobile phone on the afternoon of 5 April 1998, had bought a new one, and had left the new one at the 777 Café; that he allowed Nitrovic (amongst others) to drive the BMW and the keys to the BMW had been given to Nitrovic through others on the afternoon of 5 April 1998; and that he had been at his unit on the evening of 5 April 1998 and late in the evening had gone to the Sydney Casino, then to a nightclub and a hotel, and in the early hours of 6 April 1998 back to the Casino. 
      
       
     84 The appellant said that when he was travelling he allowed others to use the BMW, including Nitrovic and Vincent. He flew to the United States on 6 April 1998, on a ticket booked in January 1998, and said that he had arranged with Nitrovic that Nitrovic would pick the car up from where it was parked. Further as to the appellant’s movements on the evening of 5 April 1998, he said that until he left the unit he was with his girlfriend Nevana Radivojevic, and that after various telephone conversations Seamus Vincent arrived with a man named Awin Mawardi at about 10 pm and the appellant and Mawardi went to the Casino. The appellant then went to the nightclub and so on.  
      
       
     85 An alibi notice was given naming Nevana Radivojevic and Mawardi. Nevana Radivojevic was not called, and there was evidence that she had gone to Yugoslavia and would not return. Mawardi was not called, and some correspondence with Mawardi’s lawyers was tendered. Seamus Vincent gave evidence of telephone conversations arranging to take Mawardi to the appellant’s unit, and that he took Mawardi to the unit at 10 pm on 5 April 1998. A Jim Byrnes gave evidence of dropping Mawardi at the 777 Café between 5.30 and 6.30 pm on 5 April 1998, and that Mawardi said that he (Mawardi) intended to go to the Casino with the appellant.  
      
       
     86 Seamus Vincent also gave evidence of receiving the keys to the BMW and passing them on to Nitrovic, that he had never seen the appellant serving customers at the 777 Café, and that he was unable to identify any person fitting the description of the older guy given by May. Vincent gave evidence to the effect that Oldham arrived at his home at Marrickville at about 8 pm on 5 April 1998 and gave him the keys to the appellant’s unit.  
      
       
     87 Dobri Maksimovic gave evidence that he had arranged to meet the appellant at the nightclub, and that he met him at about 11.30 pm on 5 April 1998.  
      
       
     88 Each of these defence witnesses was extensively cross-examined, and there were other elements of their evidence and other witnesses in the defence case to which I have not referred. The cross-examination was quite effective, and it was well open to the jury to find the evidence of Vincent, Seamus Vincent and the others unconvincing and otherwise to see little weight in the evidence on which the defence sought to say that the appellant could not have gone to and been at the premises on the evening of 5 April 1998. The trial judge observed in the summing-up that the primary attack was on the honesty of Mullany, and on appeal the unreasonableness of the verdicts was said to lie in doubt which should have been experienced about Mullany’s evidence of the appellant’s involvement for reasons not turning upon strength of the defence evidence. While the evidence as a whole is to be considered, I have therefore not set out in greater detail the evidence of witnesses called in the defence case. 
      
       
        
       Ground of appeal 2: The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury as to the elements of the offence of murder 
        
        
       Ground of appeal 2A: The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury as to the elements of the offence of manslaughter 
        
       
     89 As will appear, the framing of these grounds of appeal did not really match the grounds as put in submissions. The Crown did not object to the mis-match. There were two limbs to the grounds of appeal as put in submissions. One was concerned with the directions as to what had to be contemplated by the appellant as a possibility in order that he be criminally responsible for the killings of Yildirim and Unsal. The other was concerned with the directions as to possibility. 
      
       
     90 The jury was directed that the Crown did not allege that the appellant and the other men planned to kill Yildirim and Unsal, and that on the Crown case the plan “was to assault them”. These grounds of appeal took up the evidence underlying that aspect of the Crown case -  
      
       
        
       (a) from May, that Puta said “No, guns, no guns, no shootings. Something to that effect”. 
        
        
       (b) from May, that Nitrovic said that “all he wanted us to do was restrain him, hold him down”, and something like “There is going to be no shooting. It’s only if they shoot”; 
        
        
        (c) from Mullany, that someone said “gag them and tie their hands, no noise”;  
        
        
       (d) from Mullany, that Mackic produced some nylon rope and said, “Gag them, tie their hands”, and demonstrated with the rope; 
        
        
       (e) that rope was handed around and was found at the premises; and 
        
        
       (f) of the number of men involved, all physically strong and most with martial arts or security work experience (I have not thus far referred to the evidence to that effect, but this general summation is sufficient.) 
        
       
     91 The appellant submitted that the criminal enterprise was not one of shooting Yildirim and Unsal , but one in which there was not to be any shooting unless (as Nitrovic indicated) Yildirim and Unsal themselves started shooting. He submitted that it was open to the jury to infer that any shooting by the men in the ambush party was only to be in self defence. He submitted that the trial judge should have directed the jury that, to find the appellant guilty of murder, they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant realised that one or more of the parties to the criminal enterprise might shoot at least one of Yildirim and Unsal intending to kill him or inflict grievous bodily harm upon him otherwise than in self defence; and should have directed the jury that, to find the appellant guilty of manslaughter, they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant realised that one or more of the parties to the criminal enterprise might fire a gun otherwise than in self defence. The errors lay in the absence of directions to the effect of the underlined words. 
      
       
     92 As can be seen, although the grounds of appeal as framed were in terms of the directions as to the elements of the offences of murder and manslaughter, this limb of the grounds as put in submissions was concerned with the directions as to what had to be contemplated by the appellant as a possibility in order that he be criminally responsible for the killings of Yildirim and Unsal. I use the language of contemplation as a possibility. That language has been used in the cases. Other language can be used, for example, language of realisation or foresight that something might happen, and has been used in the cases. For present purposes nothing turns on the mode of expression, and I will generally stay with the perhaps stilted language of contemplation as a possibility. 
      
       
     93 The Crown submitted that the directions for which the appellant contended were not required both in principle and according to the law as explained in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316; that in any event the trial judge’s directions would have been understood in the manner for which the appellant contended; and that, again in any event, there was no miscarriage of justice because on the evidence the appellant could not but have contemplated the possibility of a shooting otherwise than in self defence. 
      
       
     94 It is convenient first to go to the trial judge’s directions. 
      
       
     95 The Crown submitted that the summing-up when considered as a whole conveyed to the jury not only that before the appellant could be convicted of murder or manslaughter they would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he contemplated the possibility that murder might be committed, but also that the contemplation that murder might be committed was a contemplation of the possibility of a killing occurring otherwise than in self defence. The same applied, it was said, in relation to the directions concerning manslaughter. And, it was said, the absence of complaint by the very experienced counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial indicated that the jury was sufficiently instructed that if the only killing contemplated as a possibility by the appellant was one done in self defence, then he should be found not guilty.  
      
       
     96 The trial judge said - 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, let me turn then to the basis upon which the Crown says that the accused is guilty of each of those crimes, that is the basis in law. 
         
        
        
         
         It is not the Crown case that the accused himself shot either of the deceased. True it is Mr Mullany gave evidence that he saw the accused standing over the prone Mr Unsal, the accused holding what looked like a gun. I will explain to you the relevance of that evidence in a moment. But I emphasise it is not the Crown case that it was the accused himself that shot either of these two men. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown does not have to prove who it was that shot either of them. What the Crown sets out to prove is that, in the circumstances, the accused was criminally responsible for each of those shootings. As I have said, the central issue in this case is whether the accused was even present when those two men were shot. However, if you were satisfied that he was, I must explain to you how he might in law be criminally responsible for those shootings. This involves examining firstly the criminal responsibility of whoever did shoot those two men: that is,  
         whether the shooting in each case was unlawful 
          and, if so, whether it amounts in law to murder or manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         You may think it is almost impossible to determine from the evidence who shot Mr Unsal. That is a comment about the facts which you can accept or reject as you see fit. That is your province. However, there is evidence from Mr Mullany that it was Mr Nitrovic, Steve Nitrovic, who shot Mr Yildirim and, on Mr Mullany’s evidence, that appears to be immediately after Mr Yildirim had stabbed Mr Nitrovic, inflicting upon him quite serious wounds. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to the killing of Mr Yildirim, then, that evidence raises  
         a possible issue of self-defence by Mr Nitrovic, which would make the killing lawful 
         . Alternatively, it raises an issue of what we call in law provocation which would make the killing manslaughter rather than murder. 
         
        
        
         
         The best way to go about my task then, I think, is to explain to you first how a person acting alone might be criminally responsible for a killing and how that killing might be classified as murder or manslaughter. Then I will turn to the situation where that person kills in the company of another person and we will examine how that other person might become criminally responsible for that killing.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     97 The trial judge began the first explanation - 
      
       
        
         
         “Let us look first at the situation of a man killing a person acting alone, not in company of anybody else. As we all know, people can be killed in a wide variety of circumstances. Some killings are entirely by accident or misadventure in circumstances where whoever caused the death is not guilty of any crime.  
         Some deliberate killings are lawful. The more common example being a killing done in self-defence. 
          That is a matter I will turn to shortly. 
         
        
        
         
         When we talk about unlawful killings the law classifies them either as murder or manslaughter. Broadly speaking by the term ‘murder’ we mean the more serious class of killings. The term ‘manslaughter’ killings which, for one reason or another, are seen as less blameworthy. That does not alter the fact that manslaughter is still a very serious crime. I am not going to give you a law lecture but I have to tell you as much about murder and manslaughter as you will need to know to decide the issues raised by the evidence in this case.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     98 The trial judge gave directions about the elements of the crime of murder. He then said - 
      
       
        
         
         “I call them the basic ingredients of the crime of murder because, even if each of those ingredients is proved, that does not necessarily mean that the person charged is guilty of murder.  
         The killing, even with that intent, may be lawful 
         . In other circumstances a killing with that intent might be partly excused, so as to be classified as manslaughter rather than murder. 
         
        
        
         
         Let me deal with killings that may be lawful. For present purposes I am talking now about killings in self-defence 
         . As I have said, that arises here because of the possibility that Mr Nitrovic shot Mr Yildirim at a time when he, Mr Nitrovic, was himself under attack. I will say a little more about that in a moment.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     99 The trial judge gave directions about what was involved in self defence, in the course of which he said that the issue arose because of Mullany’s evidence that Nitrovic shot Yildirim and that Nitrovic was heard to shout that Yildirim had a knife and was injured by the knife: hence, the trial judge said, there was a question whether it was Nitrovic who shot Yildirim and, if so, whether at that moment he was acting in self defence. 
      
       
     100 The trial judge dealt with provocation in relation to Nitrovic shooting Yildirim. He then continued - 
      
       
        
         
         “Although neither Counsel addressed you on this matter or the matter of self-defence, they are matters which I am required to raise with you because they are issues which do arise on the evidence. I emphasise that these issues of self-defence and provocation arise only in relation to the killing of Mr Yildirim. It may arise from Mr Mullany’s evidence that it was Mr Nitrovic who shot Mr Yildirim and Mr Mullany’s evidence of the circumstances in which this occurred. If you consider it reasonably possible that it was Mr Nitrovic who shot Mr Yildirim and that he did so in self-defence,  
         then that killing would be lawful and not amount to a crime at all 
         . Alternatively, if you considered it reasonably possible that Mr Nitrovic shot Mr Yildirim and that he did so under provocation then that killing would be classified as manslaughter rather than murder.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     101 The trial judge turned to manslaughter. He said - 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, what I am about to say now is applicable to both charges, both the killing of Mr Yildirim and the killing of Mr Unsal. There is another way in which  
         a person who kills unlawfully 
          would be guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. That is if the person who killed did not intend to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. Nevertheless, that person might be guilty of manslaughter on the basis that the killing was the result of an unlawful and dangerous act. For present purposes, an unlawful act means an act not done in self-defence. That issue appears to arise here only in relation to the killing of Mr Yildirim.  
         There is no evidence to suggest that the killing of Mr Unsal was done in circumstances which would make it lawful 
         .” (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     102 Directions were given as to the elements of manslaughter.  
      
       
     103 The trial judge then said - 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, that is a thumb nail sketch of the basic principles of the law of homicide when one examines the conduct of a person who actually did the killing. I want to turn now to the situation where a person kills someone whilst he is involved in a criminal enterprise with another man or other men. The question, which is of central importance in this case, is how the other man or those other men might be criminally responsible for that killing. The principle is the same no matter how many people you are talking about. For convenience I will talk about a criminal enterprise in which two men are joined. 
         
        
        
         
         If two men set out to commit a crime, each of them is responsible for what the other does in committing that crime. However, it may be in the course of that criminal enterprise one of the men commits an additional crime, a crime other than the one which they had planned. In that event, the other man would also be guilty of that additional crime if he contemplated the possibility that it might be committed in the course of carrying out the criminal enterprise they had planned. That contemplation is sufficient to make that other man criminally responsible for that additional crime. It would be no defence for that other man to say, ‘That is not the crime we planned to commit’ or, I didn’t want that to happen’ or, ‘I hoped it wouldn’t happen’. Provided the other man realised it could happen, he also is guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         Here the Crown does not allege that Mr Bikic and the other men said to have been involved in this enterprise planned to kill Mr Yildirim and Mr Unsal. The plan, the Crown says, was to assault them. For present purposes I do not need to go into he law of assault. It is sufficient to say in law the notion of assault is not confined to striking someone. Even to restrain someone physically amounts to an assault. If the enterprise here were to ambush the two deceased and to physically restrain them in some way, whatever else might have happened, that would be a criminal enterprise because it would involve an assault. However, this accused is charged with murder not with assault. In the event Mr Yildirim and Mr Unsal were shot dead. 
         
        
        
         
         Let me turn then to explain to you precisely how this accused might be criminally responsible for each of those shootings and I will do that after a short break.” (italics added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     104 The short break became an overnight adjournment, and the next morning the trial judge continued - 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Yesterday you will remember I took you to some basic principles of law. 
         
        
        
         
         I commenced by dealing with circumstances  
         in which a killing may be justified so as to be lawful 
         . Then I dealt with unlawful killings and how they might be classified as either murder or manslaughter depending on the circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         I then began to take you to the law of what we call common purpose. That is how, when two men combine to commit a particular crime, and one of them commits an additional crime, the other man might be criminally responsible for that additional crime. As I explained to you that principle is relevant here because it is not suggested by the Crown that the plan was to kill either Mr Yuildirim or Mr Unsal. The plan was to assault them but, as it happened, in the course of that assault both were killed. 
         
        
        
         
         I reminded you it is not the Crown case that the accused himself killed either of them. But the question is: Is he criminally responsible for those killings? For him to be criminally responsible for either of those killings you would have to be satisfied, in the first place, beyond reasonable doubt, that he was a party to that enterprise to assault the two men.  
         You would then turn to the question whether he realised that, in the course of carrying out that assault, one or more of his companions might shoot at least one of the deceased. If you were satisfied that he realised that, then he himself would be responsible for the shootings in law, even though he himself did not do them.  
         
        
        
         
         It is at this stage, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to distribute to you a very brief outline of principles of law which, I hope, will help you follow what I am about to say.” (emphasis and italics added) 
         
        
       
     105 Copies of the outline of directions were handed to the jury, and became MFI 76. 
      
       
     106 The trial judge said - 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, I start with the obvious proposition: If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was present when the deceased were killed, that is the end of the matter. Go no further. He must be found not guilty of both charges. The directions of law I am about to give you apply only if you are satisfied that he was present at that house that night. 
         
        
        
         
         As I have said, the accused would be criminally responsible for the shootings if he took part in this enterprise to assault realising that, in the course of it, one of his companions might shoot at least one of the deceased men 
         . Of course, you would have to be satisfied that Mr Yildirim and Mr Unsal were killed by one of the accused’s companions in this criminal enterprise, although, as I have said, the Crown does not have to prove which one of them it was. 
         
        
        
         
         It is for that reason that the crucial question here is whether the accused was a party to a plan to ambush the deceased realising that in the course of that ambush one or more of his companions might shoot at least one of the deceased. However, to be found guilty of murder you would need to be satisfied that the accused realised that that shooting could occur in circumstances amounting to murder; that is that one of his companions might shoot at least one of the deceased intending to kill him or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused could not be found guilty of murder unless you are satisfied he realised one of his companions might fire a gun with that intent 
         . In addition, you would have to be satisfied, as to each of the deceased, that whoever did shoot him did in fact shoot intending to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. Otherwise that shooting would not amount to murder in law. In other words, you would have to be satisfied, as to each deceased, that he was killed in circumstances mounting to murder.  
         
        
        
         
         If the circumstances in which the deceased was killed were lawful then that killing would be no crime 
          and the accused himself could not be found guilty of any crime arising from it. If the circumstances in which either of the deceased were killed amounted to manslaughter, rather than murder, then the accused himself could not be found guilty of anything more than manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         As I have said, there was evidence that it was Mr Nitrovic who shot Mr Yildirim and that he did so acting in self-defence. If that were so  
         the killing of Mr Yildirim would be lawful 
          and the accused would not be criminally responsible for it. He could not be found guilty of either murder or manslaughter in relation to the killing of Mr Yildirim. 
         
        
        
         
         As I have said, the issue of self-defence being raised, it is not for the accused to prove Mr Yildirim was killed in self-defence, it is for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was not. 
         
        
        
         
         So, the question is whether you think it is reasonably possible that Mr Nitrovic killed Mr Yildirim and that he did so in self-defence. Unless the Crown can exclude that possibility beyond reasonable doubt the accused must be found not guilty of the murder or manslaughter of Mr Yildirim . The accused must be acquitted outright.” (emphasis and italics added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     107 The trial judge turned to the outline of directions provided to the jury. The appeal papers before us did not contain a copy of MFI 76, and neither the appellant nor the Crown provided a copy in order to take us to it.  
      
       
     108 From reference in the summing-up, the outline included in a summary of the ingredients of murder, “that the shooting was unlawful”. In going through the outline of directions the trial judge again referred, at some length, to self defence as an issue arising in relation to the shooting of Yildirim. He then said - 
      
       
        
         
         “As I say in the outline in relation to Mr Yildirim, the question  
         whether his killing was unlawful 
          arises only because there is evidence that Mr Nitrovic may have shot him and may have done so in self-defence. In that event,  
         the killing would be lawful 
          if Mr Nitrovic believed on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to shoot Mr Yildirim in self-defence. Unless the Crown could exclude beyond reasonable doubt the possibility that Mr Nitrovic shot Mr Yildirim in self defence, the accused must be found not guilty of both the murder and manslaughter of Mr Yildirim.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     109 The trial judge later said - 
      
       
        
         
         “The basis of manslaughter that I am going to turn to now focuses on the state of mind of the accused himself, what he foresaw might happen in the course of this assault. 
         
        
        
         
         As I have said, to find the accused guilty of murder you would have to be satisfied that he took part in the assault upon the deceased realising not only that one or more of his companions might shoot at least one of the deceased, but also that that person might do so intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon that deceased.  
         
        
        
         
         This accused could not be found guilty of murder as to either charge unless you were satisfied that he foresaw that one of his companions might fire a gun with that intent. If you were not satisfied of that, you would have to consider whether the accused foresaw that a gun might be fired but not to kill or seriously harm either of the deceased but perhaps to frighten without aiming at them. You would also have to consider whether a person doing that in those circumstances would be committing a dangerous act, that is, an act exposing either of the deceased to the appreciable risk of serious injury. If you were satisfied of those things then it would be open to you to find the accused guilty of the manslaughter rather than the murder of both the deceased 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         Let me go back to the outline; we are now on page 4 under the heading Manslaughter – Contemplation of the Accused. This issue arises if you are satisfied of the first, second, fourth and fifth points set out on page 1 but not satisfied of the third. Assume you are satisfied that the accused was a party to the enterprise to assault, that he knew one or more of his companions had a gun, that one or more of his companions did in fact shoot the particular deceased intending to kill him or inflict grievous bodily harm upon him and that shooting was unlawful,  
         but you are not satisfied that 
          the accused realised that one of his companions to the enterprise might fire a gun with that intent, might fire a gun intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm.  
         If you are satisfied that the accused realised that one of the parties to the criminal enterprise might fire a gun but without intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon either of the deceased but in such a way as to expose either of them to an appreciable risk of serious injury, in that event the accused should be found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter in respect of both charges. This basis of liability focuses not upon what the killer actually did or what the killer intended but what the accused realised might happen when participating in this enterprise. If his anticipation of what might happen went no further than foreseeing one of his companions might fire a gun but not intending to kill or seriously hurt anyone, at most the accused could be found guilty of manslaughter of the two deceased, he could not be found guilty of the murder of either of them 
         .” (italics added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     110 Towards the end of the summing-up the trial judge said that the Crown submitted that the jury would be satisfied of the honesty and accuracy of Mullany’s evidence and that it put the appellant at the scene and apparently holding a gun himself, and continued - 
      
       
        
         
         “From that evidence it is said you would conclude that all the elements of the crime of murder, which I have set out in this outline, are made out. The Crown says you could conclude the accused was at the house, that he was a party to an ambush, that he had a gun or knew others did  
         and that he realised a shooting might occur amounting to murder 
         . The Crown submitted you would accept that it was Mr Nitrovic who shot Mr Yildirim, although, as I have said, the Crown does not have to prove it, but the Crown argued you would reject that shooting was done under self-defence or provocation but in circumstances amounting to murder. 
         
        
        
         
         True it is there is no eyewitness evidence to the shooting of Mr Unsal. The Crown submitted you would conclude beyond reasonable doubt that he was shot by one of the accused’s companions in this criminal enterprise and that shooting also  
         occurred in circumstances amounting to murder 
         .” (bold added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     111 The Crown referred particularly to what it said were occasions on which the trial judge made clear that a killing in self-defence was lawful. I have emphasised relevant parts of the passages set out. It then said that, when giving directions about joint criminal enterprise, the trial judge told the jury that what the appellant needed to contemplate as a possibility was a crime. The result, it said, was that putting these things together the jury would have understood that the appellant could not be found guilty if he had only contemplated the possibility that there might be a killing or a shooting in self-defence, because that would not have been a crime. In the passage last set out from the summing-up, it said, the trial judge in effect so directed the jury, because he repeated the Crown’s contention that the jury could conclude that the appellant “realised a shooting might occur amounting to murder” and the shooting by one of the appellant’s companions “occurred in circumstances amounting to murder”. I have put those parts of the passage in bold. 
      
       
     112 I do not think the Crown’s submissions in this respect should be accepted. 
      
       
     113 Although the trial judge did make clear that a killing in self-defence was lawful, he did so in relation to the ingredients of murder. How that translated to manslaughter was perhaps not explained in the passages I have set out, but it is not necessary to explore that matter. He did so expressly with reference to the killing of Yildirim alone, excluding self defence as an issue in the killing of Unsal. As I have said, the appellant’s submissions now under consideration were concerned with directions as to what must be contemplated as a possibility for liability by reason of the killings of Yildirim and Unsal. What is contemplated is different from what happens in fact, and a person may contemplate the possibility that there might be a killing only in self defence although as events turn out there is no issue of self defence; conversely a person may not contemplate any such possibility although as events turn out there is an issue of self defence. 
      
       
     114 Thus, making clear that a killing in self defence was lawful did not without more address what must be contemplated for criminal responsibility by reason of the killings of Yildirim and Unsal. When the trial judge came to the directions about joint criminal enterprise, he did not put together the lawfulness of a killing and the appellant’s contemplation. I have italicised relevant parts of the passages set out. The first italicised part speaks of contemplation of commission of a crime. But the other italicised parts speak of contemplation of shootings. Overall, the effect on the jury would not have been that, because a killing in self defence was not a crime, the appellant could not be found guilty if he had only contemplated the possibility that there might be a killing or a shooting in self defence. The effect would have been that contemplation of the possibility that there might be a killing or a shooting was sufficient, together with other matters, for criminal responsibility as party to the criminal enterprise. Whether the killing or shooting was a crime because not in self defence was relevantly not part of the directions. 
      
       
     115 Further, even if the jury had put together lawfulness of a killing and contemplation of possibility of a crime, they had been told that there was no issue of self defence in relation to the killing of Unsal. In the manner the matter was left, there was removed from their consideration any contemplation involving the killing of Unsal in self defence, and so any need to be satisfied that the appellant contemplated the possibility that one of the parties to the criminal enterprise might shoot Unsal otherwise than in self defence. 
      
       
     116 I am not persuaded, therefore, that the Crown is correct in its submission that the directions would have been understood in the manner for which the appellant contended.  
      
       
     117 I go then to whether the directions for which the appellant contended were required. 
      
       
     118 In McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 the Crown case was that the victim was killed in an attack pursuant to a common purpose to rob or roll someone, and included that the members of the group contemplated the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm as a possible incident in carrying out the common purpose. The directions given were summarised in the High Court (at 113) as conveying to the jury - 
      
       
        
         
         “ … that, even if the common purpose of the three youths did not embrace the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm, there was a sufficient intent on the part of either appellant for the purposes of murder if he contemplated the intentional infliction of grievous bodily by one of the other participants as a possible incident in the carrying out of their joint enterprise and continued to participate in that enterprise.”  
         
        
        
         
        
       
     119 The accused contended on appeal that it was necessary that all parties to the criminal enterprise contemplate the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm as a possible incident of the carrying out of the enterprise so as to form part of the common purpose. That contention was rejected, and it was held (at 118) that either a shared common intention or an individual contemplation of the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm as a possible incident of the enterprise would be a sufficient intention on the part of either of the accused for criminal responsibility for the killing.  
      
       
     120 In the course of its reasons the Court said of its earlier decision in Johns v The Queen (1980) 143 CLR 108 - 
      
       
        
         
         “In  
         Johns 
          this Court was concerned with the common purpose of a joint criminal enterprise. In particular, it was concerned with whether the scope of the common purpose extended to possible as well as probable incidents of the venture. The scope of the common purpose is no different from the scope of the understanding or arrangement which constitutes the joint enterprise; they are merely different ways of referring to the same thing. Whatever is comprehended by the understanding or arrangement, expressly or tacitly, is necessarily within the contemplation of the parties to the understanding or arrangement. That is why the majority in Johns in the passage which we have cited above spoke in terms of an act which was in the contemplation of both the secondary offender and the principal offender. There was no occasion for the Court to turn its attention to the situation where one party foresees, but does not agree to, a crime other than that which is planned, and continues to participate in the venture. However, the secondary offender in that situation is as much a party to the crime which is an incident of the agreed venture as he is when the incidental crime falls within the common purpose. Of course, in that situation the prosecution must prove that the individual concerned foresaw that the incidental crime might be committed and cannot rely upon the existence of the common purpose as establishing that state of mind. But there is no other relevant distinction. As Sir Robyn Cooke observed [in  
         Chan Wing-Siu v The Queen 
          (1985) AC 168 at 175], the criminal culpability lies in the participation in the joint criminal enterprise with the necessary foresight and that is so whether the foresight is that of an individual party or is shared by all parties. That is in accordance with the general principle of the criminal law that a person who intentionally assists in the commission of a crime or encourages its commission may be convicted as a party to it.” (at 117-8) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     121 The appellant relied for his submissions upon this passage, taking up the references to commission of a crime and submitting that if the contemplation had to be of the possible commission of a crime, then it was insufficient that the appellant contemplated that there might be a shooting in self defence as an incident of the criminal enterprise.  
      
       
     122 I do not think that McAuliffe v The Queen supports the submission. The Court’s references to commission of a crime were plainly not intended to address that matter. By “crime” the Court meant the relevant acts – in that case, the acts constituting the crime of murder. On numerous occasions in the course of the reasons the Court spoke in terms of the acts or actions in contemplation, one instance being (at 118) that the prosecution case was that the death of the victim “was caused by an act or acts for which each of the appellants was responsible”. The distinction being made by the appellant in the present case between acts in contemplation not constituting a crime and acts in contemplation constituting a crime was simply not in question. 
      
       
     123 Apart from authority, the appellant submitted that there could not be the commission of a crime by reason of contemplation of something unless that which was contemplated was itself a crime. In principle, it need not be so. There is no reason in principle why an accused’s criminal responsibility should not be attached to the acts of another person even if that person is not guilty of a crime, and no reason why the criminal responsibility should not be attached to acts of the accused done with the contemplation of related acts of another person even if the acts of that person do not amount to a crime. If the accused’s criminal responsibility is not derivative from and dependent on the guilt of another person, but is primary, the guilt of the other person or contemplation of acts of the other person amounting to a crime is not mandated. 
      
       
     124 The question is whether the appellant’s criminal responsibility was derivative, and more particularly whether, although not mandated, one of the constituents of his crime was that the contemplated shooting by one of the ambush party was a crime because not in self defence. 
      
       
     125 The nature of liability for participation in a joint criminal enterprise was discussed in the judgment of McHugh J in Osland v The Queen. Kirby and Callinan JJ agreed with his Honour’s discussion. 
      
       
     126 McHugh J said (at 341-2) - 
      
       
        
         
         “[70] At common law, a person who commits the acts which form the whole or part of the actus reus of the crime is known as a ""principal in the first degree"". There can be more than one principal in the first degree. However, a person may incur criminal liability not only for his or her own acts that constitute the whole or part of the actus reus of a crime but also for the acts of others that do so. The liability may be primary or derivative. … 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         [71] Those who aided the commission of a crime but were not present at the scene of the crime were regarded as accessories before the fact or principals in the third degree. Their liability was purely derivative and was dependent upon the guilt of the person who had been aided and abetted in committing the crime. Those who were merely present, encouraging but not participating physically, were regarded as principals in the second degree. They could only be convicted of the crime of which the principal offender was found guilty. If that person was not guilty, the principal in the second degree could not be guilty. Their liability was, accordingly, also derivative.  
         
        
        
         
         [72] However, there is a third category where a person was not only present at the scene with the person who committed the acts alleged to constitute the crime but was there by reason of a pre-concert or agreement with that person to commit the crime. In that category, the liability of each person present as the result of the concert is not derivative but primary. He or she is a principal in the first degree. In that category each of the persons acting in concert is equally responsible  
         for the acts 
          of the other or others.”  
         
        
        
         
        
       
     127 His Honour cited from R v Lowery and King (No 2) (1972) VR 560 at 650, R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556-7 and Brett, Waller & Williams, Criminal Law, 8th ed, 1997 at 465, and continued (at 343-4) - 
      
       
        
         
         “[75] As a result, a person may be found guilty of murder although he or she did not commit the acts which physically caused the death of the victim and the person who did is found guilty only of manslaughter. In R v Howe, all their Lordships were of the opinion that R v Richards, which had held that the person who did not perform the acts could not be guilty of a more serious charge than the actual perpetrator, was wrongly decided. Lord Mackay said - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘[W]here a person has been killed and that result is the result intended by another participant, the mere fact that the actual killer may be convicted only of the reduced charge of manslaughter for some reason special to himself does not, in my opinion in any way, result in a compulsory reduction for the other participant.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         This statement is conclusive in England, at all events, in showing that it is the acts, and not the crime, of the actual perpetrator which are attributed to the person acting in concert. If the latter person has the relevant mens rea, he or she is guilty of the principal offence because the actus reus is attributed to him or her by reason of the agreement and presence at the scene. It is irrelevant that the actual perpetrator cannot be convicted of that crime because he or she has a defence such as lack of mens rea, self-defence, provocation, duress or insanity.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     128 Saying that this was “almost certainly” the view of the Privy Council in Hui Chi-Ming v The Queen (1992) 1 AC 34, and considering and citing from that case, his Honour repeated (at 345) that “it is the acts of the actual perpetrator which are attributed to a non participant who is acting in concert and is present at the scene”. He said (at 345) -  
      
       
        
         
         “The principle that those who act in concert and are present at the scene are responsible for the acts of the actual perpetrator operates to make a person guilty of the principal crime even though the actual perpetrator is acquitted completely. Thus, the person who did the act may be legally insane. Yet as long as that person had sufficient mental capacity to enter into the arrangement or common understanding, the other participant present at the scene will be guilty of committing the principal crime if he or she has the relevant mens rea. In  
         Matusevich v The Queen 
         , this Court decided that, when two persons are said to be acting in concert, the fact that the actual perpetrator is legally insane does not necessarily mean that the conviction of the other, who was present at the scene, should be quashed. If the actual perpetrator has sufficient capacity to enter into the agreement or understanding, the person present at the scene who was acting in concert may be convicted of the offence.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     129 His Honour said (at 346) - 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Markby v The Queen 
          also supports the conclusion that it is the wrongful acts of the perpetrator which are attributed to the person acting in concert and present at the scene.  
         Markby 
          establishes that if violence is one of the contemplated incidents of a joint criminal enterprise and one of the accused kills a person, the other accused can be convicted of manslaughter even though the killer is guilty of murder. This decision is consistent only with the conclusion that it is the acts constituting the actus reus, and not the crime, of the actual offender which are attributed to the other party. The liability is direct or primary, not derivative.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     130 After reference to further cases, McHugh J said (at 350) - 
      
       
        
         
         “[93] Where the parties are acting as the result of an arrangement or understanding, there is nothing contrary to the objects of the criminal law in making the parties liable for each other's acts and the case for doing so is even stronger when they are at the scene together. If any of those acting in concert but not being the actual perpetrator has the relevant mens rea, it does not seem wrong in principle or as a matter of policy to hold that person liable as a principal in the first degree. Once the parties have agreed to do the acts which constitute the actus reus of the offence and are present acting in concert when the acts are committed, the criminal liability of each should depend upon the existence or non-existence of mens rea or upon their having a lawful justification for the acts, not upon the criminal liability of the actual perpetrator. So even if the actual perpetrator of the acts is acquitted, there is no reason in principle why others acting in concert cannot be convicted of the principal offence. They are responsible for the acts (because they have agreed to them being done) and they have the mens rea which is necessary to complete the commission of the crime.” 
          
         
        
       
     131 The Crown submitted that the position as thus established was conclusive of the present question. The appellant could be guilty of murder or manslaughter if he contemplated the possibility of a shooting even where the person or persons who shot Yildirim and Unsal were acting in self defence: to repeat from the judgment of McHugh J (at 344) - 
      
       
        
         
         “ … it is the acts, and not the crime, of the actual perpetrator which are attributed to the person acting in concert. If the latter person has the relevant mens rea, he or she is guilty of the principal offence because the actus reus is attributed to him or her by reason of the agreement and presence at the scene. It is irrelevant that the actual perpetrator cannot be convicted of that crime because he or she has a defence such as lack of mens rea,  
         self-defence 
         , provocation, duress or insanity.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     132 The appellant submitted that what was said in Osland v The Queen did not extend to the situation in this case. He submitted that what was said was confined to where there was agreement to do an act, and established that there could be liability for the doing of the act even though the person who did the act was not guilty of a crime; but that what was said had no bearing on “extended common purpose”, that is, where the act was not agreed but was only contemplated as something which might be done in carrying out the joint enterprise, as in McAuliffe v The Queen. In the latter situation, it was said, the accused’s liability should be regarded as derivative rather than primary. 
      
       
     133 Although in Osland v The Queen McHugh J’s discussion generally took up agreement to commit a crime, more correctly to do the acts constituting the actus reus of the crime, when noting Markby v The Queen (1978) 140 CLR 108 his Honour also referred to violence as one of the contemplated incidents of a joint criminal enterprise. In Markby v The Queen it was held that even if the victim’s death was an unexpected consequence of carrying out the agreement to rob the accused could be guilty of manslaughter. His Honour appears to have regarded the liability as primary, not derivative, even where the act was not agreed but was contemplated as a possibility. 
      
       
     134 In my opinion, there is no sound reason for distinguishing in the present context between criminal responsibility for an act which is agreed as part of a criminal enterprise and criminal responsibility for an act which is contemplated as a possibility in carrying out the enterprise. In both cases there is the common purpose of carrying out the criminal enterprise. In both cases the act of another person is attributed to the accused, in the one case because the accused agreed that the act should be done and in the other case because the accused contemplated the possibility that it might be done. Agreement is a form of contemplation, contemplation that something will be done, and at bottom it is the common purpose and what the accused contemplated will or might be done in carrying out the criminal enterprise which founds the accused’s criminal responsibility. Thus in McAuliffe v The Queen, as is evident from the passages earlier set out, the reasoning was that both an act within the common purpose (agreed) and an act incidental to the common purpose (forseen as a possibility) sufficed for criminal responsibility. And where the parties have agreed to do the acts constituting the actus reus of a crime and are present acting in concert, the objects of the criminal law are equally served by making them liable for acts of each other contemplated as possibilities in carrying out the common purpose as by making them liable for acts of each other agreed to be done. The McAuliffe v The Queen basis of liability so recognises. 
      
       
     135 Hence I do not agree that the appellant’s liability should be regarded as derivative, requiring a different approach for that which is contemplated as something which might be done from the approach for that which is contemplated as something which will be done. 
      
       
     136 The appellant submitted that even if the act rather than the crime of the other person was attributed to the accused, it was necessary that the accused have mens rea. He drew attention to McHugh J’s references in the passages I have set out to possession of mens rea in addition to attribution of the actus reus, and submitted that there would not be mens rea if all that was contemplated was the possibility of a killing in self defence. 
      
       
     137 This, it seems to me, does not assist the appellant. The relevant mental element in cases such as the present is the accused’s contemplation. In R v Powell (1999) 1 AC 1 it was argued that murderous intent in the party to the criminal enterprise was necessary. Lord Hutton (with whom the other members of the House agreed, in some cases with additional reasons) considered (at 25) the possible anomaly “that if foreseeability of death or really serious harm is not sufficient to constitute mens rea for murder in the party who actually carries out the killing, it is sufficient to constitute mens rea in a secondary party”, but on public policy grounds considered that the anomaly should not assist the argument. And in McAuliffe v The Queen at 116 the Court cited with approval from R v Hyde (1991) 1 QB 134 at 139, itself founded on Chan Wing-Sui v The Queen (1985) AC 168 - 
      
       
        
         
         “If B realises (without agreeing to such conduct being used) that A may kill or intentionally inflict serious injury, but nevertheless continues to participate with A in the venture, that will amount to a sufficient mental element for B to be guilty of murder if A, with the requisite intent, kills in the course of the venture. As Professor Smith points out, B has in those circumstances lent himself to the enterprise and by so doing he has given assistance and encouragement to A in carrying out an enterprise which B realises may involve murder.” 
         
        
       
     138 If the acts and not the crime of the actual perpetrator are attributed to the person acting in concert, to use the words of McHugh J, and the actus reus is thereby established, the relevant mens rea is contemplation of those acts as a possible incident in the carrying out of the joint enterprise. There is no added mental element to the effect that the accused contemplated the acts in circumstances amounting to a crime. 
      
       
     139 In my opinion, therefore, the trial judge was not required to give the jury the directions for which the appellant contended. It may be noted that the direction that, unless the Crown excluded beyond reasonable doubt that Nitrovic killed Yildirim in self defence the appellant must be found not guilty of the murder or manslaughter of Yildirim, appears to have been more favourable to the appellant than the law required. 
      
       
     140 Although it is not material to the outcome of the appeal, there remains the Crown’s submission that in any event there was no miscarriage of justice because on the evidence the appellant could not but have contemplated the possibility that there might be a shooting otherwise than in self defence. Here in particular the Crown raised the absence of complaint by the appellant’s counsel at the trial, suggesting that realistically there was no question of contemplation of a shooting in self defence. Of course, counsel’s silence could equally be attributed to an appreciation that the directions for which the appellant contended in the appeal were not required.  
      
       
     141 The jury was generally directed by reference to shootings, rather than infliction of grievous bodily harm. If the jury accepted the Crown case, they would have been satisfied that the appellant contemplated the possibility that Yildirim or Unsal might be shot by one of the ambush party. Could they properly have regarded the contemplation as contemplation of a shooting in self defence? 
      
       
     142 There was an ambush, with the intention of restraining Yildirim and Unsal and tying them up. If Yildirim and Unsal were readily overpowered there would be no shooting. Any shooting would come if Yildirim or Unsal resisted the attack made on him, possibly but not necessarily in a manner endangering the life or limb of one or more of the ambush party. If the ambush developed in this way, the shooting would either be the better to subdue the man shot, or alternatively in response to the threat to life or limb. As events turned out the alternatives may be thought unreal, and that comes up under ground of appeal 3, but at this point the appellant’s contemplation is under consideration.  
      
       
     143 So far as the shooting was the better to subdue the man shot, there would be no question of self defence. So far as the shooting was in response to the threat to life or limb, the self defence would not be of the kind making the killing lawful: see R v Nguyen (1995) 36 NSWLR 397, in which Priestley JA said (at 407) - 
      
       
        
         
         “That kind of self-defence has as its starting point a person who, not wanting to fight, is attacked or threatened with attack in a way leading the person to believe self-defence is necessary for the person's own protection from harm. Such situations do not include those where what is going on is a fight which the fighters have willingly joined in, whether to carry on or settle a quarrel, or for some other reason. Once such a fight is under way, the person who has, ex hypothesi, got into it for reasons other than self-defence, may often, because of the nature of fighting, be suddenly faced with injury or death, and to prevent that, self-defence in one sense will be necessary, which may lead to the injury or death of the opponent. That sort of self-defence, if it ends in the killing of the opponent, is not the sort of self-defence that the Crown must negative in showing (when the issue arises) that the killing has been unlawful. The last sentence may need qualification in some circumstances, as for example, if a fight is going on according to broadly understood conventions intended to prevent serious harm and one fighter suddenly breaks the conventions by producing a lethal weapon. That kind of possible qualification does not arise in the present case.” 
         
        
        
       
     144 So also in Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) (1987) 162 CLR 645 it was said (at 664) - 
      
       
        
         
         “The whole of the surrounding circumstances are to be taken into account and where an accused person has created the situation in which force might lawfully be applied to apprehend him or cause him to desist — where, eg, he is engaged in criminal behaviour of a violent kind — then the only reasonable view of his resistance to that force will be that he is acting, not in self-defence, but as an aggressor in pursuit of his original design. A person may not create a continuing situation of emergency and provoke a lawful attack upon himself and yet claim upon reasonable grounds the right to defend himself against that attack.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     145 On the evidence before the jury, if they were satisfied that the appellant contemplated that Yildirim or Unsal might be shot by one of the ambush party I do not think that they could properly have regarded his contemplation as contemplation of a shooting in self defence. It was not a situation where Yildirim or Unsal might escalate any conflict to one where life or limb of the men in the ambush party was threatened – plainly shooting by Yildirim or Unsal was forseen. Nor was it a situation where the men in the ambush party might break off their attempt to restrain Yildirim and Unsal but be pursued – equally plainly the ambush party were at all times to be the aggressors. For these reasons also the directions for which the appellant contended were not required. 
      
       
     146 I go to the second limb of grounds of appeal 2 and 2A. 
      
       
     147 The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in directing the jury to the effect that it was necessary that the appellant realise that one of the ambush party might shoot Yildirim or Unsal, or contemplate the possibility that an additional crime might be committed in the course of carrying out the criminal enterprise. Language of this kind appears in the passages earlier set out. The submission was directed to the notion of possibility. The appellant submitted that the jury should have been directed to the effect that, if they thought it a reasonable possibility that a risk of a shooting or an additional crime might have occurred to the appellant, but that the risk might genuinely have been dismissed by him as altogether negligible, the contemplation of the risk was insufficient for criminal liability.  
      
       
     148 The description of a risk which might genuinely have been dismissed as altogether negligible was taken from Chan Wing-Sui v The Queen. In that case it was submitted that, while it was not necessary to have foreseen as more probable than not a contingency in which a weapon might be used, it was necessary to have foreseen that if the contingency eventuated it was more probable than not that the weapon would be used. Delivering the advice of the Privy Council, Sir Robyn Cooke said (at 178) that on the facts there was no evidential foundation for an argument that if one of the accused foresaw the use of knives by the other two, it was “only as a risk so remote that he disregarded it”. He continued (at 179) - 
      
       
        
         
         “Where there is an evidential foundation for a remoteness issue, it may be necessary for the judge to give the jury more help. Although a risk of a killing or serious bodily harm has crossed the mind of a party to an unlawful enterprise, it is right to allow for a class of case in which the risk was so remote as not to make that party guilty of a murder or intentional causing of grievous bodily harm committed by a co-adventurer in the circumstances that in the event confronted the latter. But if the party accused knew that lethal weapons, such as a knife or a loaded gun, were to be carried on a criminal expedition, the defence should succeed only very rarely. 
         
        
        
         
         In cases where an issue of remoteness does arise it is for the jury (or other tribunal of fact) to decide whether the risk  
         as recognised by the accused 
          was sufficient to make him a party to the crime committed by the principal, Various formulae have been suggested – including a substantial risk, a real risk, a risk that something might well happen. No one formula is exclusively preferable; indeed it may be advantageous in a summing up to use more than one. For the question is not one of semantics. What has to be brought home to the jury is that occasionally a risk may have occurred to an accused’s mind – fleetingly or even causing him some deliberation – but may genuinely have been dismissed by him as altogether negligible. If they think there is a reasonable possibility that the case is in that class, taking the risk should not make that accused a party to such a crime of intention as murder or wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The judge is entitled to warn the jury to be cautious before reaching that conclusion; but the law can do no more by way of definition; it can only be for the jury to determine any issue of that kind on the facts of the particular case.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     149 In R v Powell at 30-31 Lord Hutton expressed agreement with what his Lordship described as - 
      
       
        
         
         “ … the judgement of the Privy Council in [ 
         Chan Wing-Siu v The Queen 
         ] that the secondary party is subject to criminal liability if he contemplated the act causing the death as a possible incident of the joint venture, unless the risk was so remote that the jury take the view that the secondary party genuinely dismissed it as altogether negligible”. 
         
        
        
       
     150 The appellant submitted that in the present case the more detailed directions postulated in Chan Wing-Siu v The Queen were called for. In substance, he said that the directions should have gone beyond unembroidered language of possibility, and should have conveyed that the possibility had to be substantial rather than remote; that where there was to be an ambush in which Yildirim and Unsal would be overpowered and tied up, and the ambush party comprised something like eight men many of great physical strength and experienced in martial arts or security work, the risk of something going awry whereby death or grievous bodily harm would be occasioned to Yildirim or Unsal was one which the appellant could have dismissed.  
      
       
     151 In McAuliffe v The Queen the Court spoke on a number of occasions in terms of possibility, and approved directions in those terms. The Court’s citation from Chan Wing-Siu v The Queen included reference by Sir Robyn Cooke to a crime foreseen as a possible incident of the common unlawful enterprise. The Court did not advert to different or additional directions where there is “an evidential foundation for a remoteness issue”.  
      
       
     152 Apart from McAuliffe v The Queen, directions in similar language to that used by the trial judge have been consistently approved, see for example Johns v The Queen; Mills v The Queen (1986) 61 ALJR 59; R v Sharah (1992) 30 NSWLR 292; and R v Jenner & Masters (2000) 110 A Crim R 512. In the last of these cases it was argued that the directions should have included that the possibility had to be more than a slender chance, and had to be a substantial risk. The Court considered that it was not a case calling for the added directions and that the commonly given directions adequately brought home to the jury the issue they had to decide. On the facts, being agreement to commit a burglary while one of the party had with him a crossbow and a bolt with which it might be loaded, the directions were “not likely to cause the jury to take into account speculative or hypothetical possibilities” (at 518).  
      
       
     153 Perhaps in some cases more detailed directions will be appropriate, but they are not necessary in all cases. It is not necessary further to consider whether or when more detailed directions will be appropriate. It is fanciful to suggest that they were required in this case.  
      
       
     154 There was evidence that Yildirim possessed a gun and was proficient in handling guns, and there was evidence that Unsal was a very strong man competent in martial arts, possessing guns and acting as bodyguard for Yildirim. Perhaps some of this should be put aside in the absence of clear evidence that the ambush party knew of these qualities of the persons whom they were to ambush, although May’s evidence included Nitrovic saying before the ambush that “the big guy” (Unsal) had a gun. It remains that guns had been handed out amongst the ambush party, that they spoke of shooting if Yildirim or Unsal shot first, and that their preparations showed that they considered Yildirim and Unsal no easy targets. If the jury accepted the Crown case, I do not think they could have taken the view that the appellant contemplated a remote or insubstantial possibility, or something which could be dismissed as altogether negligible. The directions given by the trial judge sufficiently guided the jury on this aspect of their task, and it may be noted that the appellant’s counsel at the trial did not seek different or additional directions. 
      
       
        
       Ground of appeal 3: The trial judge erred in failing to leave the defences of self defence and provocation to the jury in respect of Mehmet Unsal 
        
       
     155 Counsel for the appellant at the trial asked the judge to leave the defences of self defence and provocation to the jury in respect of the killing of Unsal. The trial judge declined to do so, saying that “[t]here does not appear to me to be any evidence sufficient to raise those issues in respect of that count”. The transcript of counsel’s submissions in this respect at the trial is by way of a summary only, and is not easy to understand, but the substance seems to have been that the evidence going to Unsal’s shooting permitted an inference of a struggle, with a possibility that Unsal shot and “did not shoot last”, and that the uncertainty was such that the defences should be left to the jury.  
      
       
     156 I pass over whether, in the light of what I have said concerning grounds of appeal 2 and 2A, any error in failing to have the defences to the jury in respect of Unsal would matter. I do not think there was error. 
      
       
     157 The appellant submitted that there was evidence sufficient for the defences to have been left to the jury. There was evidence that Unsal had possessed Glock guns, and from its registration to him and the bullet found in his pocket it could be inferred that the Glock automatic pistol found on the grass verge some distance from the premises had been in Unsal’s possession when he entered the premises. One shot could have been fired from the Glock automatic pistol before it jammed. Puta had been shot, and had Unsal’s blood on his clothes consistent with involvement with a struggle with Unsal. Although the evidence was that Unsal’s neck wound would have brought immediate death, it was open to infer, it was submitted, that Unsal brandished the Glock automatic pistol before he was shot, and even that he fired it, and that he was then shot by a man in the ambush party when the man was confronted by a real danger of himself being shot.  
      
       
     158 It is enough that there was evidence which, if believed, might reasonably lead the jury to fail to be satisfied that the man who shot Unsal was not acting in self defence or under provocation (Van den Hoek v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 158 at 162; R v Kear (1997) 2 VR 555 at 557, R v Thorpe (1998) 102 Cr App R 278 at 283). But the jury must act rationally, and not by way of speculation: see R v Lane (1983) VR 449 at 462 and R v Kear at 557. So in R v Marshall (CCA, 17 July 1990, unreported) it was said that to ask whether a question of self defence arises on the evidence involves asking whether there was a realistic possibility that the jury might reach a view of the facts, “that is to say, the evidence and the inferences to be drawn from that evidence, as distinct from the speculation”, which would leave open an arguable case of self defence. The suggested self defence was held to be mere speculation “too far removed from any available view of the evidence to require consideration”. 
      
       
     159 Accepting that the Glock automatic pistol was Unsal’s, there was no evidence that it had been fired. May and Nanai were told “to grab the big guy” (Unsal), and that he had a gun. May did grab Unsal, and there was nothing in May’s evidence indicating that Unsal was able to or did brandish the Glock automatic pistol before May left the premises. Mullany saw May and Nanai and a person who must have been Unsal, “it was like they were wrestling”. He looked towards the front door and saw what he then described, and then he turned towards the lounge room and saw the prone Unsal. The precision of the order of events will be considered later in these reasons, but even on the view most favourable to the appellant Unsal must have been shot within moments of May releasing him.  
      
       
     160 Unsal had been struck on the head, and had no defence injuries. From his wounds and the mark on the door jamb and hole in the floor, Unsal first suffered the neck wound and was shot again as he fell to the floor. Perhaps Unsal had been able to free the Glock automatic pistol from wherever he carried it, since someone must have taken it from the premises, but, in my opinion, it would be no more than speculation to infer that he brandished it before he was shot so as to incite his own shooting, let alone to infer that he fired it. The evidence did not provide the necessary foundation for the defences to be left to the jury. 
      
       
     161 Moreover, Unsal was set upon by men who had waited in ambush for him and were intent on restraining him and tying him up. There should be recalled what I said when dealing with the second limb of the submissions in relation to grounds of appeal 2 and 2A. Even if Unsal had managed to brandish the Glock automatic pistol so as to incite his own shooting, in the circumstances revealed in the evidence any self defence of the man who shot him would not be of the kind making the killing lawful. By parity of reasoning, any notion of provocation does not arise. 
      
       
     162 It may not have been appropriate to leave self defence and provocation to the jury in relation to the killing of Yildirim, but that favoured the appellant. In my opinion, the trial judge was correct in declining to leave self defence and provocation to the jury in relation to the killing of Unsal.  
      
       
        
       Ground of appeal 5: The trial judge erred in failing to provide any assistance to the jury in respect of the drawing of inferences 
        
       
     163 In his introductory directions to the jury the trial judge said - 
      
       
        
         
         “As I have also said, it is for you to decide what inferences or conclusions you draw from the evidence. You must bear in mind, however, that any inferences or conclusions must be fairly available from the evidence. There is no room in a trial such as this for speculation or guesswork. The central issue here is whether or not the accused was present at the house at Bankstown when these killings occurred. However, if you were satisfied that he was present, then questions will arise as to his knowledge of the presence of guns and as to the state of mind of the persons who fired them. Those matters are very much matters of inference or conclusion from the evidence and I will have more to say about those matters later.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     164 The trial judge did not thereafter specifically direct the jury in relation to drawing inferences or conclusions from the evidence, although he again referred to drawing inferences at the conclusion of the summing-up.  
      
       
     165 The appellant submitted that the Crown case significantly called for the drawing of inferences from circumstantial evidence. The inferences were of various kinds, for example whether the older guy described by May was the appellant, whether calls in the telephone records showed the appellant’s involvement in preparations for the ambush, and whether the appellant (if a party to the criminal enterprise) contemplated the possibility of the shootings. He submitted that the trial judge should have directed the jury that where they relied on circumstantial evidence, guilt should not only be a rational conclusion but also the only rational conclusion that could be drawn from the circumstances; further, that the trial judge should have directed the jury that they could not draw an inference of guilt unless the facts they accepted pointed so clearly to guilt that they could not reasonably be explained in any other way.  
      
       
     166 In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 Dawson J, with whom Mason CJ and Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed, said (at 578-9) - 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned trial judge gave the customary direction that, where the jury relied upon circumstantial evidence, guilt should not only be a rational inference but should be the only rational inference that could be drawn from the circumstances: see  
         Hodge's Case 
         ;  
         Peacock v The King 
         ,  
         Plomp v The Queen 
         . Whilst a direction of that kind is customarily given in cases turning upon circumstantial evidence, it is no more than an amplification of the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. In many, if not most, cases involving substantial circumstantial evidence, it will be a helpful direction. In other cases, particularly where the amount of circumstantial evidence involved is slight, a direction in those terms may be confusing rather than helpful. Sometimes such a direction may be necessary to enable the jury to go about their task properly. But there is no invariable rule of practice, let alone rule of law, that the direction should be given in every case involving circumstantial evidence. It will be for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether it should be given. As Barwick CJ, speaking for the Court, observed in  
         Grant v The Queen 
          :  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Where the circumstances of the case seem to require that some such direction be given, the summing up regarded as a whole may prove to be, and generally may be likely to be, inadequate. On the other hand, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the nature of the summing up, the failure to give the special direction may not in a particular case result in an inadequacy of the summing up as a whole. It may none the less be concluded from the terms of the summing up that the jury were fully instructed.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Similarly, in  
         McGreevy v Director of Public Prosecutions 
         , the House of Lords refused to lay down a rule that any special direction should be given in relation to the use of circumstantial evidence.” 
         
        
       
     167 The issue in Shepherd v The Queen was whether it was necessary to direct the jury that they could not use a fact as a basis for inferring guilt unless that fact was proved beyond reasonable doubt. It was held that it was not necessary. Dawson J said (at 579) that circumstantial evidence is evidence of a basic fact or facts from which the jury is asked to infer a further fact or facts; that in some cases the jury could draw the ultimate inference of guilt without expressly identifying intermediate facts themselves inferred; and that sometimes it would be appropriate to identify an intermediate fact as indispensable and appropriate to tell the jury that that fact must be found beyond reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference can be drawn. But, his Honour said, this should not be done where the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, or where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so, and - 
      
       
        
         
         “It will generally be sufficient to tell the jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     168 The speech of Lord Morris in McGreevy v Director of Public Prosecutions (1973) 1 WLR 276 to which the Court referred is instructive. His Lordship said (at 285-6) - 
      
       
        
         
         “In my view, it would be undesirable to lay it down as a rule which would bind judges that a direction to a jury in cases must be given in some special form, provided always that in suitable terms it is made plain to a jury that they must not convict unless they are satisfied of guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. In the present case there were only two possible verdicts: one was a verdict of not guilty and the other a verdict of guilty. In the judgment of Lowry CJ it is noted that during the course of a long summing up the learned judge had on at least 10 occasions warned the jury of the need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. The issue before the jury was whether it was the appellant or whether it was someone else who killed the deceased. If the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant they must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was no one else. They could only have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt if the evidence which they accepted led them irresistibly to that conclusion. 
         
        
        
         
         To introduce a rule as suggested by learned counsel for the appellant would, in my view, not only be unnecessary but would be undesirable. In very many criminal cases it becomes necessary to draw conclusions from some accepted evidence. The mental element in a crime can rarely be proved by direct evidence. I see no advantage in seeking for the purposes of a summing up to classify evidence into direct or circumstantial with the result that if the case for the prosecution depends (as to the commission of the act) entirely on circumstantial evidence (a term which would need to be defined) the judge becomes under obligation to comply when summing up with a special requirement. The suggested rule is only to apply if the case depends ‘entirely’ on such evidence. If the rule is desirable why should it be so limited? And how is the judge to know what evidence the jury accept? Without knowing this how can he decide whether a case depends entirely on circumstantial evidence? If it were to apply, not only when the prosecution case depends entirely on circumstantial evidence, but also if ‘any essential ingredient’ of the case so depends, there would be a risk of legalistic complications in a sphere where simplicity and clarity are of prime importance. 
         
        
        
         
         In agreement with the Court of Criminal appeal I would reject the contention that there is a special obligation upon a judge in the terms of the proposition of law that I have set out. There should be no set formulae which must be used by a learned judge. In certain types of cases there are rules of law and practice which require a judge to give certain warnings though not in any compulsory wording to a jury. But in the generality of cases I see no necessity to lay down a rule which would confine or define or supplement the duty of a judge to make clear to a jury in terms which are adequate to cover the particular features of the particular case that they must not convict unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
     169 In Grant v The Queen (1975) 11 ALR 503 Barwick CJ had said (at 504) that there was neither a rule of law nor an invariable rule of practice that the direction must or should be given in a case in which the prosecution relies upon circumstantial evidence, and in a passage which includes the shorter passage cited in Shepherd v The Queen that - 
      
       
        
         
         “It must be remembered that the direction suggested by Baron Alderson in  
         R v Hodge 
         , supra, is an amplification of the direction that the Crown must prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt. Unquestionably, there are cases which depend upon circumstantial evidence in which it would be proper and, indeed, there are cases in which it is necessary, for the trial judge to assist the jury by way of some such direction as is now being sought. Whether or not it is either proper or necessary is a matter which, in the first place, the trial judge must resolve for himself. I use the word “proper” because I can well understand that in some cases the direction might confuse more than assist the jury, depending on the nature of the case and of the evidence given in support of it. 
         
        
        
         
         Where the circumstances of the case seem to require that some such direction be given, the summing up regarded as a whole may prove to be, and generally may be likely to be, inadequate. On the other hand, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the nature of the summing up, the failure to give the special direction may not in a particular case result in an inadequacy of the summing up as a whole. It may none the less be concluded from the terms of the summing up that the jury were fully instructed. 
         
        
        
         
         The trial judge, therefore, in the case where circumstantial evidence is relied upon by the prosecution, must consider whether or not the case calls for the assistance of the jury by the giving of a direction specifically directed to the application of the onus of proof to circumstantial evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         A Court of Criminal Appeal when the adequacy of a summing up is challenged, for want of a special direction, will itself consider whether the case is one in which it was necessary to give a further direction. If it concludes that the circumstances of the case call for the assistance of the jury by the giving of the special direction, the court will then consider whether the summing up as a whole was inadequate in its instruction of the jury. But it will be the inadequacy of the summing up as a whole to instruct the jury as to their task which warrants the Court of Criminal Appeal in setting aside the conviction and ordering a new trial.” 
         
        
        
       
     170 In Knight v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495 Mason CJ and Dawson and Toohey JJ repeated (at 502) that the direction is “no more than an amplification of the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt”. In this Court, in R v Clarke (CCA, 29 March 1995, unreported) Hunt CJ at CL said of a direction to the effect of the directions presently in question - 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no invariable rule of practice, let alone rule of law, that such a direction is required in every circumstantial evidence case. Although helpful in most cases, it is (in turn) no more than an amplification of the rule that the Crown must establish its case beyond reasonable doubt. In some cases, however, such a direction may be necessary to enable the jury to go about their task properly. Where such a case arises, and the direction is not given, this Court must consider whether the summing up, regarded as a whole, is inadequate. 
         
        
       
     171 Thus there is no question of an overarching requirement to give the directions which the appellant submitted should have been given. It is necessary to consider the particular circumstances, and as was pointed out in R v Clarke that includes what innocent explanations of the relevant facts were fairly available. And it is necessary to consider the adequacy of the summing-up as whole, with particular regard to whether directions as to proof of the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt were sufficient or whether further assistance was necessary.  
      
       
     172 As the Crown case was left to the jury, it was less of a circumstantial case than the appellant’s submissions suggested. The jury was told that the central issue was whether the appellant was present at the premises at the time of the murders. It was also instructed, expressly as a direction of law, that “you could not find this accused guilty of either of these charges unless you were satisfied that Mr Mullany’s evidence about his involvement in this event is honest and accurate”; this was repeated later in the summing-up. The direction may have been more favourable to the appellant than the evidence warranted, but it was given and must have focussed the jury’s attention on Mullany’s direct evidence of the appellant’s involvement. Of course, the jury was still faced with inferring further facts from basic facts, both in deciding whether it accepted Mullany’s evidence of the appellant’s involvement and in addressing, for example, the appellant’s contemplation. But on the core matter of acceptance of Mullany’s evidence of the applicant’s involvement as honest and accurate, it was not a case of an innocent explanation for what Mullany said occurred. The appellant was there or he was not there, and the appellant’s counsel starkly put to the jury that Mullany was a liar. 
      
       
     173 Early in the summing-up the trial judge fully directed the jury that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of each of the charges brought against the appellant. On a number of occasions thereafter the trial judge reminded the jury of this, including when dealing with the appellant’s alibi evidence, with self defence, and with provocation. When the written outline of directions was provided to the jury the trial judge told them that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was present when Yildirim and Unsal were killed, and when going through the written outline the trial judge repeatedly referred to the need for satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. 
      
       
     174 The trial judge concisely summarised the cases for the Crown and the appellant, with particular reference to whether the appellant was present at the premises on the evening of 5 April 1998 and to Mullany’s evidence. At the conclusion of the summing-up the trial judge reminded the jury that, if they were satisfied that the appellant was present at the relevant time, it still fell to them to consider whether the elements of either murder or manslaughter were made out, “which involves examining the evidence and drawing inferences, if you can, about the state of mind of whoever actually shot either of those men and the state of mind of the accused himself”. The trial judge said, “I have set out those matters in the outline.”  
      
       
     175 In the overall summing-up, it is scarcely conceivable that the jury failed to appreciate that insofar as they acted by inference they should not speculate or guess, and that the appellant’s guilt had to be a rational conclusion and with satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. That excluded there being any fairly available innocent explanations. The appellant’s counsel at the trial did not seek the directions for which the appellant contended on appeal, and it must be concluded that with his intimate knowledge of the trial he did not consider that, in the circumstances, the directions were necessary in order that the jury properly fulfil their task.  
      
       
     176 In my opinion, in the circumstances the summing-up was sufficient and neither the directions nor the further assistance for which the appellant now contends was required. That is confirmed by the absence of any request by counsel for the appellant at the trial. 
      
       
        
       Ground of appeal 6: The convictions are unreasonable 
        
       
     177 It was common ground that the Court’s approach was that described in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493, that - 
      
       
        
         
         “ … the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     178 The reasons in M v The Queen continued (at 494-5) - 
      
       
        
         
         “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.”  
         
        
        
       
     179 The submissions in support of the ground of appeal were directed to the appellant’s presence at the premises. As has been noted, the central issue at the trial was whether the appellant was present at the premises at the time of the killings. The appellant contended that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was present.  
      
       
     180 The focus was on the evidence of Mullany. Only Mullany identified the appellant as one of the men going to and at the premises. May gave evidence as to the older guy, but the appellant said that May’s description of the older guy did not well match the appellant’s appearance at the time and that May’s recollection that the older guy did not have an accent was inconsistent with the appellant’s speech. As has also been noted, the jury was directed that they could not find the appellant guilty unless they were satisfied that Mullany’s evidence about his involvement was honest and accurate.  
      
       
     181 In summary, the appellant submitted that the jury ought to have experienced doubt that Mullany’s evidence about the appellant’s involvement was honest and accurate because - 
      
       
        
       (a) Mullany’s credibility was compromised by what occurred when he was interviewed by the police and by his giving evidence under an indemnity;  
        
        
       (b) his evidence was not consistent with the forensic and ballistic evidence and the evidence of May; and 
        
        
       (c) he had been shown to be incorrect in other respects. 
        
       
     182 Before going in more detail to the submissions as to Mullany’s evidence, I should deal with one element in the appellant’s submissions. So far as he relied on inconsistency with the evidence of May, the appellant emphasised that, when warning the jury in relation to the evidence of Mullany the trial judge said that both Mullany, and May were involved but - 
      
       
        
         
         “My warning, however, is directed only to the evidence of Mr Mullany. Both the Crown and Mr Nicholson put forward Mr May as an honest witness. The Crown has submitted to you in some respects he might be mistaken on his recollection, but both sides put him forward as an honest witness. The Crown put forward Mr Mullany as an honest witness. Mr Nicholson, make no bones about it, says he is a liar.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     183 This does not, however, make May’s evidence a touchstone by which the purity of Mullany’s evidence is tested. An honest witness may be mistaken. The appellant’s counsel at the trial was not likely to brand May as a dishonest witness, given May’s evidence as to the older guy. It is evident that the Crown put both May and Mullany forward as honest witnesses, and if there were inconsistency May could have been the one who was mistaken: the Crown put him forward as in some respects mistaken in his recollection. Inconsistency would, of course, be material to the reasonableness of the jury’s verdict, and inconsistency of Mullany’s evidence with the forensic and ballistic evidence would be another matter. But so far there was inconsistency between May and Mullay the jury’s task included deciding which of May and Mullany was to be accepted, and it was not bound to act on May’s evidence. Indeed, he can hardly have presented as giving an open account of how he came to be one of the ambush party. 
      
       
     184 In the light of the directions earlier mentioned, the jury must have accepted that Mullany was reliable and credible in his evidence that the appellant went to the premises and participated in the affray. The jury did not have to accept that he was reliable and credible in everything he gave in evidence. The trial judge gave appropriate directions in relation to the assessment of witnesses, including that it was entirely a matter for the jury whether they accepted the whole of a witness’s evidence, some of it, or none of it. That a jury is entitled to do so has particularly arisen in relation to alleged inconsistency in verdicts on different counts, and in that context has recently been considered in R v Markulevski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82. It was there affirmed that, if a jury has a reasonable doubt about a complainant’s evidence going to one count, it is not thereby obliged to have a doubt about the complainant’s evidence going to another count – it depends upon the particular facts and the directions which the jury was given. It was open to the jury to believe Mullany as to the appellant’s going to and being at the premises, but not as to every detail, and a verdict is not necessarily unreasonable because all the evidence can not be reconciled or because not all the evidence of a key witness is accepted. 
      
       
     185 I go in more detail to the submissions as to Mullany’s evidence. 
      
       
        
       (a) Compromised credibility 
        
       
     186 Mullany was taken into custody at either 10am or 12.35pm on 12 November 1998. His formal interview commenced at 8pm on that day. He implicated the appellant in his statement. At the appellant’s trial Mullany gave evidence to the effect that the police painted a bleak picture of his future unless he cooperated and that he was assured that if he did cooperate some pending drugs charges would be made to go away; he agreed that the police in effect offered a life in gaol or being a witness against the appellant and the other men. The police officers gave evidence denying Mullany’s evidence in this respect and to the effect that no pressure or inducements were used to obtain Mullany’s cooperation. In cross-examination Mullany agreed that he knew the police wanted evidence against the appellant.  
      
       
     187 The appellant submitted that on any view Mullany’s evidence was compromised. If he was subjected to pressure or inducements, that tainted his evidence; if he was not, he was a liar. In submissions the knowledge that the police wanted evidence against the appellant was elevated to the police naming the appellant to Mullany, and it was suggested that the long period prior to the formal interview provided ample time for the pressure or inducements and for the appellant to be identified by the police as a man whom Mullany could profitably implicate. The indemnity, it was submitted, was a product of these occurrences, and provided further reason for Mullany to implicate the appellant and in due course give his evidence that the appellant was one of the men going to and at the premises – evidence, it was suggested, the more deceptive because Mullany was in a position to inject participation by the appellant into an otherwise correct and therefore credible account. 
      
       
     188 There was something of a dilemma for the Crown in the divergence between Mullany and the police officers, but the Crown submitted that in reality Mullany’s position supported the key evidence of the appellant’s participation in the affray. Mullany denied falsely naming the appellant in order to gain an advantage for himself, and as to the police naming the appellant in effect said that he was the first to use the appellant’s name, Ned, and that the police then added the appellant’s surname. It was quite clear that when he gave evidence Mullany knew that there was no question of the drugs charges going away, although it was equally clear that he could possibly obtain a sentencing discount for assisting the authorities. The indemnity was dated 2 February 1999, and Mullany was protected from prosecution in relation to the killings only if he told the truth. Mullany was most unlikely to have invented the appellant’s participation in the affray, it was said, when in November 1998 or February 1999 for all he knew the appellant had an unassailable alibi – the risk of Mullany ending up without the benefit of the indemnity but even worse off was one he would not have taken. All this was overtly left to the jury as going to whether Mullany was telling the truth in his evidence of the appellant’s involvement, and the trial judge reminded the jury that Mullany might “weave a false account around a framework of events which he knows can be independently established” and gave the jury copious warnings as to his evidence.  
      
       
        
       (b) Consistency  
        
       
     189 There was no forensic evidence demonstrating the appellant’s presence at the premises. This was correctly acknowledged as a matter of little significance. On the Crown case, the members of the ambush party took steps to avoid leaving traces of their presence (the rubber gloves and removal of jewellery). There was no forensic evidence to the contrary of the appellant’s presence at the premises, nor was the absence of forensic evidence demonstrating his presence at the premises in the circumstances noteworthy. 
      
       
     190 Inconsistency otherwise with the forensic evidence and inconsistency with the ballistics evidence and the evidence of May is best considered as a whole. It received the greatest attention in the appellant’s submissions. 
      
       
     191 There were some differences between May and Mullany as to the gathering at the 777 Café, although except as to the continued presence of Colin they were not really inconsistencies. There was inconsistency as to who drove the BMW (Curry; the appellant then Curry) and who was in the BMW (Curry, May, the older guy and another man; the appellant, Curry, May.) There was a degree of inconsistency as to what took place at the address at Marrickville (rubber gloves handed around; rubber gloves not handed around until Bankstown), and Mullany gave evidence of some happenings there which May did not mention. May and Mullany put themselves in different places in the lounge room and kitchen/dining area after entering the premises (at the dining table; on the lounge), and each gave some evidence of happenings in the waiting period which the other did not give. 
      
       
     192 May said that he grabbed Unsal near the linen cupboard, and the appellant suggested that the forensic and ballistic evidence indicated that Unsal’s neck wound was suffered when Unsal was towards the front door end of the hallway because the bullet which probably caused the neck wound struck the door jamb of bedroom 2. Therefore, the appellant submitted, Mullany can not have seen May, Nanai and Unsal “like they were wrestling” when he went into the hallway from bedroom 2 and looked towards bedroom 3. To see Unsal, he would have had to look towards the front door. 
      
       
     193 From where Yildirim was found, the drag marks, and Nitrovic’s blood on the wall outside bedroom 1, the appellant suggested that Yildirim was shot when he was on the garage door side of the hallway and Nitrovic was on the bedroom 1 side of the hallway. Of more importance, it was said, from Yildirim’s wounds he was not facing whoever shot him. Therefore, the appellant submitted, Mullany can not have seen Nitrovic near the garage door shooting at Yildirim when Nitrovic and Yildirim were facing each other. Yildirim would have been on the other side of the hallway and with his back to Nitrovic. 
      
       
     194 Mullany gave no evidence of seeing Puta, either when he saw May, Nanai and Unsal “like they were wrestling” or when he saw Curry and the appellant standing near the head of the prone Unsal. From the forensic evidence, it was suggested, Puta must have engaged with Unsal because of the blood on his T-shirt, and Mullany must have had some contact with Puta because his blood was on Puta’s T-shirt and shoes. Therefore, the appellant submitted, Mullany was not giving an honest account of what he saw. 
      
       
     195 On Mullany’s evidence, after he saw the prone Unsal he saw May alongside him in the hallway and they and others ran out the front door together. The appellant suggested that on May’s evidence May ran out the front door with Mullany and others immediately after disengaging from Unsal, and that Unsal must still have been standing at the time. Therefore, the appellant submitted, Mullany can not have seen Curry and the appellant standing near the head of the prone Unsal. Mullany would have run out of the front door before Unsal was shot. 
      
       
     196 Lack of congruence in evidence, and differing recollections of some events, is a common manifestation of variance in observation and recall. In particular, it is not surprising that, with something like ten men struggling violently in the ill-lit hallway of a small suburban dwelling, recollections of events measured only in seconds should differ. Nor would it be surprising if in some respects the recollections were inaccurate. It was, as the Crown described it, a “highly kinetic incident”. Yildirim and Unsal were both hit on the head, probably with the butt of the Glock automatic pistol and the butt of the Sportco rifle respectively. Fifteen shots were fired from at least three different guns, wounding members of the ambush party as well as killing Yildirim and Unsal. Yildirim used his knife to some effect. The Crown submitted that so far as there were the discrepancies in the last few paragraphs on which the appellant relied, they were no more than could be expected, and did not undermine the key elements of Mullany’s evidence - that there was a violent struggle and the appellant was seen standing near the head of the prone Unsal.  
      
       
     197 The Crown submitted that May was not necessarily reliable as to the other man in the BMW, because he could not describe him and when he marked the positions of the men on the plan of the premises the number of men did not allow for the other man. As to May’s description of the older guy, May said that he was trying not to look at the older guy and was “worried about the situation” and “just kept to myself and tried not to pay attention to anyone”. The Crown submitted that May could not be expected to have been precise in his description of the older guy, and that he was substantially correct in his description (long hair, slim, Caucasian (May was of Tongan ancestry), about 5’ 9”, late 40’s) and was less than firm in his recollection of no accent. More important, the Crown said, May saw the older guy serving people in the 777 Café, and “he looked like he was running the cafeteria”. Mullany’s evidence included that the appellant had served him, and there was evidence that no one else who served in the café at the time had long hair. The Crown submitted that overall the conclusion that the older guy was the appellant was well open to the jury, and that the difference between May and Mullany about who drove the BMW was explicable because both had Curry driving after the stop at Marrickville: May could have elided the two stages of the journey.  
      
       
     198 As to other differences in the evidence of May and Mullany of events prior to the affray itself, the Crown said that they also were unexceptional, and that in any event May could have been the one who was mistaken: that was a matter for the jury. There was general consistency, it was said, in the gathering at the 777 Café and, in particular, in the pay-offs in the back room, in the going to Marrickville and sitting on the brick fence, and in the going on to Bankstown. It must be recognised, however, that general consistency did not greatly bear upon the involvement of the appellant, since there was no doubt that the ambush party gathered at the café and travelled to Bankstown via Marrickville. 
      
       
     199 As to the affray itself, the Crown emphasised the “highly kinetic incident”. It pointed out that May did not give evidence of Puta’s engaging with Unsal any more than did Mullany, although Puta must have been in the affray. May’s evidence that he did not see Puta after Puta left to “get them” did not mean that Puta was not there, as Puta clearly was there; nor (the Crown submitted) did it mean that the older guy whom May said left with Puta was not there. Unsal must have moved or been moved in the struggle for the very short distance from where first grabbed by May towards the end of the hallway near the entrance to the lounge room, because that was where his body was found, and May’s recollection can not have been complete. This was quite consistent with the bullet causing Unsal’s neck wound striking the door jamb of bedroom 2, because the distances were so small. Mullany could well have seen May, Nanai and Unsal “like they were wrestling” as he said, and the relevant time was so short that he could well have run out the front door with May and others after Unsal had been shot. After all, Yildirim had been shot and was on the floor when May and Mullany ran out, and Unsal’s shooting must have been either just before or just after Yildirim’s shooting. It could not realistically be thought that Yildirim and Nitrovic were or were always in the same places in a small hallway.  
      
       
     200 The Crown submitted that at least one of Yildirim’s wounds was consistent with him facing the man firing the gun, the holes in or damage to his shirt suggested shots while he was facing or struggling with the man firing the gun, and in the brief and no doubt stressful moment Mullany could have come away with the incomplete recollection of Nitrovic firing at Yildirim. Indeed, Mullany did not say that Nitrovic and Yildirim were facing each other throughout – Nitrovic was firing into Yildirim as Yildirim fell – and some of Yildirim’s wounds must have been from being shot by someone else.  
      
       
     201 The Crown submitted that Mullany’s recollection of the affray was within acceptable bounds of the capacity for observation in the circumstances, and that it was clear that Unsal’s body was where Mullany said he saw it. Mullany’s evidence was not to be measured on the assumption that May’s evidence was correct in all respects, and could be accepted consistently with the forensic and ballistic evidence. 
      
       
        
       (c) Otherwise incorrect 
        
       
     202 Mullany was said to have been shown to be incorrect in at least three respects. The first two were the differences from his evidence at committal proceedings earlier noted. The Crown submitted that they were not significant or the kind of variation in recollection to cast doubt on credibility. The third was that in the police statement Mullany had said that the Ford followed the BMW to Newtown and the BMW kept driving when the Ford stopped outside the Amcal chemist, but at the trial Mullany said that the Ford did not follow the BMW and he had not seen the BMW in Newtown. Mullany said that what he told the police was mistaken, but denied having lied to the police and said that what was recorded in the statement was badly worded: reading his evidence as a whole, he meant that he had not meant to convey that the two cars travelled together to Newtown. The statement on a fair reading did convey that: the Crown submitted that it was capable of being read as ambiguous, and that it was for the jury to decide whether they accepted Mullany’s explanation and, if they did not, what the consequences were for Mullany’s credibility and reliability.  
      
       
     203 Each of the appellant and the Crown added further matters to this Court’s assessment of the answer to the question identified in M v The Queen.  
      
       
     204 The appellant relied on the alibi evidence, but properly conceded that there were “weaknesses” in it because the two alibi witnesses in the alibi notice, Nevana Radivojevic and Mawardi, did not give evidence. As I have said, there was extensive cross-examination of Vincent, Seamus Vincent and others called in the defence case, and the appellant acknowledged that their evidence did not establish unequivocally that the appellant was not at the premises. He submitted that in combination with the matters to which I have earlier referred the defence evidence could contribute to raising a reasonable doubt that the appellant was present at the premises at the time of the killings.  
      
       
     205 The Crown relied on the telephone records, submitting that they supported the appellant’s involvement in preparations for the ambush, his presence at the 777 Café when the ambush party gathered before leaving in the cars, his notifying Vincent that the party would be arriving at Marrickville, and his dealing with the aftermath of the affray. The telephone records could have been so viewed, and the appellant acknowledged that the telephone records could found the inference that the appellant was involved without being present at the premises, but they did not have to be so viewed and of themselves were not weighty in establishing the appellant’s presence at the premises. The Crown further submitted that, from the cross-examination of Vincent and Seamus Vincent, it could have been concluded they had concocted their evidence to assist the appellant: again, this was open on the evidence, but was not itself weighty in establishing the appellant’s presence at the premises at the time of the killings.  
      
       
     206 These further matters must be borne in mind, but for ground of appeal 6 the focus was properly on the evidence of Mullany. 
      
       
     207 The Crown submitted that Mullany’s evidence was confirmed in a great many respects, such that he could generally be regarded as credible and reliable. For example, his evidence of an initial telephone call from Curry was confirmed by the telephone records, and his evidence of being driven to the 777 Café, seeing Mackic and Oldham, sitting at a table, and being taken to the back room was consistent with May’s evidence and with the admitted participation of Mackic and Oldham in the ambush party; his evidence of rubber gloves being handed around was consistent with May’s evidence although divergent as to when, and was confirmed by the findings of the box of gloves and discarded gloves; his evidence of rope being handed around was confirmed by the finding of rope; his evidence of his own wound was confirmed by a trail of his blood. Much more was pointed to, which the Crown submitted told against Mullany’s evidence being inherently unacceptable or lacking probative force. 
      
       
     208 On examination of the evidence as a whole, I am not persuaded that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. Mullany gave evidence as a man who had been involved in the killings and a man whom the jury was invited to think falsely implicated the appellant in order to obtain a benefit for himself. The jury was properly warned as to those matters, and they did not mean that a conviction from acceptance of Mullany’s evidence was not open – that would make a farce of the warnings. Mullany’s evidence was confirmed in many ways not directly concerned with the appellant’s part in the ambush party and presence at the premises, and I do not think it should be regarded as tainted or lacking probative force such that the jury could not accept it as establishing the involvement of the appellant. The jury saw and heard May and Mullany, and was squarely faced with such differences between them as there were; the jury had the task of deciding whether they accepted Mullany’s evidence notwithstanding those differences and with regard to forensic and ballistic evidence and the evidence as a whole. The matters on which the appellant relied in the appeal do not in my assessment go beyond matters which the jury could properly resolve, in fulfilling that task, with satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. 
      
       
        
       Ground of appeal 1: A miscarriage of justice was caused by the absence at the trial of evidence to be adduced on the appeal 
        
       
     209 The appellant and each of Curry, Mackic, Nanai, Nitrovic, Oldham and Puta gave evidence in the appellant’s case in the appeal. In the Crown case in the appeal there was evidence from the appellant’s counsel at his separate trial, Nicholson QC, from counsel’s instructing solicitor Kara Goodsell, and from a former girlfriend of Curry who was the subject of a non-publication order and whom I will identify only as S. All of the witnesses were cross-examined. 
      
       
     210 The appellant relied on further evidence of three kinds. The first kind was evidence that he was not at or was not seen at the premises on the evening of 5 April 1998. Evidence to that effect was given in the appellant’s case in the appeal by Curry, Mackic, Nanai, Nitrovic, Oldham and Puta. The second kind was evidence that a Mischa Lukic and a friend of Mischa were passengers in the BMW and were at the premises. Evidence going to those matters was given in the appellant’s case in the appeal by Curry, Mackic, Nitrovic and Oldham, with an oblique reference by Puta and some associated evidence about two other men talking to Puta at the premises: it emerged on minimal notice in the course of the appeal. The third kind was evidence from Puta that he (Puta) shot Unsal. It first came out during cross-examination, and was amplified in re-examination and taken up by the appellant without objection from the Crown. 
      
       
     211 By s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 an appeal shall be allowed if the Court - 
      
       
        
         
         “ … is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law,  
         or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice 
          … “. (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     212 An appeal is upheld on the ground of further evidence, that is, evidence adduced in the appeal but not called at the trial, if the court is thereby of the opinion that there was a miscarriage of justice, and “it is important to remember that the fundamental question is whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and that the principles that may be extracted from the authorities ‘should not ... be regarded as absolute or hard and fast rules’: Green v The King (1939) 61 CLR 167 at 175”: Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 395 per Gibbs CJ; see also at 402 per Mason and Deane JJ and 410 per Brennan J. 
      
       
     213 The submissions in the appeal nonetheless call for consideration of principles found in the authorities. They include a distinction between further evidence which is fresh evidence, that is, evidence which was not available at the trial or could not have been available with the exercise of reasonable diligence, and further evidence which is not fresh evidence.  
      
       
     214 Before undertaking that consideration, it is necessary to understand more about the evidence on which the appellant relied. I go to the evidence of the first two kinds: it is convenient to leave the evidence from Puta that he (Puta) shot Unsal for separate attention. 
      
       
     215 The appellant’s former co-accused gave evidence in the appeal in the order Oldham, Mackic, Curry, Nanai, Puta and Nitrovic. The hearing of the appeal commenced on 12 December 2001. At the end of 13 December 2001, while Mackic was under cross-examination, it was adjourned to 25 February 2002, and it continued on and from that date. There is some point in noting the order and the timing. Brief affidavits of Oldham, Mackic and Curry sworn on 17 November 2001 were read. Mackic and Curry gave additional oral evidence in chief, in the case of Mackic by leave when his re-examination went beyond proper bounds. The evidence in chief of Nanai, Puta and Nitrovic was wholly oral, in the case of Puta with further evidence in chief by leave in the middle of his cross-examination.  
      
       
     216 Oldham said in his affidavit that he “did not see the appellant on 5 April 1998”. He said that he was seen by Nicholson, it seems at a time after the appellant’s separate trial had begun; he informed Nicholson “in bare terms of the evidence that I would give if called”; and he was told by Nicholson that he would be called to give evidence on behalf of the appellant.  
      
       
     217 Mackic said in his affidavit that he “did not see the appellant on the evening of 5 April 1998”, and that he met Nicholson and a solicitor on two occasions and said to Nicholson that he would be happy to give evidence on behalf of the appellant. The occasions were not specifically placed in time, but in context were after Mackic had been convicted in the joint trial.  
      
       
     218 Mackic initially did not add to his affidavit, but in re-examination the appellant’s counsel took him to identification of the men walking from the cars to the premises and he referred to Mischa (the name is also spelt Misha in the transcript). The Crown objected that the evidence did not arise out of cross-examination, and it did not, but leave to re-open was requested and given.  
      
       
     219 The evidence was - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Who did you know of the group that was walking towards Allum Street?

         Q. How much older than you, roughly? 
          
         A. I don’t know, I just can’t guess. I just think he looks older than me. I don’t know, I think so he older than me. About 45, 50. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did you know Mischa? 
          
         A. I know him through some dancing club at Kings Cross, just would be around some dancing club, 777 club or something like this. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. On how many occasions had you seen him before 5 April 1998? 
          
         A. I have seen him once in six months, once in three months, once in one month, that has been nothing unusual. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had you seen him earlier that day before you saw him walking towards the Allum street house? 
          
         A. 777. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You had seen him at the 777 nightclub? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had you spoken to him there? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Are there any other characteristics about him that you can remember about how he appeared? 
          
         A. I know just was chubby and all these dark clothes and things, that is all I remember. Leather jacket, something like this. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You recall him wearing something like a leather jacket on 5 April? 
          
         A. Dark brown, not black. I know I saw him before this. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who else do you recall in this group of people other than the people you have mentioned so far? 
          
         A. I recall another, probably, two or three persons. They walk on straight by us, wasn’t part of group or part of us. I don’t know, I recall some people walking house to house. Was big group, was pretty big group. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is there any of these people that you know the names of, that you have referred to? 
          
         A. No, I just know this man, I know Mischa, that’s all.” 
         
        
        
       
     220 This was the first mention of Mischa. It came after the adjournment from 13 December 2001 to 25 February 2002. Oldham had not mentioned him. Going to Oldham’s cross-examination for a moment, he had said that at Bankstown there were, in addition to himself, Curry, Mackic, May, Nitrovic and Puta and three others. He could not name the other three, although one was “of Mediterranean or Arabic sort of complexion” and one was “a younger slim fellow”. Oldham was not recalled to give evidence about Mischa. The man Sacha Malinkovic to which Mackic referred early in this evidence was not at any other time said to have been in the Ford, or even mentioned at all. The reference to him was ignored in the appeal. 
      
       
     221 Mackic continued - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Can you tell the court who you saw in the house on that evening? 
          
         A. All of these people were there, including, I don’t know, I can’t remember seeing him outside but I know I have seen him before, but I saw him inside the house, Mischa. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you recall where you saw him inside the house? 
          
         A. I can’t. I can’t recall what position he was in the house, whether he was in room or not, I don’t know. I presume he was in the house. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You don’t know if you saw him inside the house, you presume he was in the house? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see anyone else other than the people you have named in the house? 
          
         A. No, I just heard voices from left of the room. As I was going into the bathroom, there were voices from the left of the room. I don’t know who it was.” 
         
        
        
       
     222 Mackic marked on a plan where the voices came from, being bedroom 3, and said that he did not see “anyone else other than the persons [he] referred to in that house on that night”. Although there were unidentified people in the group, since Mackic knew the appellant no doubt this was intended to convey that he did not see the appellant in the house on that night. 
      
       
     223 Curry said in his affidavit that he “did not see the appellant on 5 April 1998”; that he spoke to Nicholson on a number of occasions, the last being before the appellant was discharged from the joint trial; and that he told Nicholson that he did not see the appellant on 5 April 1998 and would be happy to give evidence on the appellant’s behalf, but would rely on the advice of his own lawyers as to whether or not he could give the evidence in a manner that would not prejudice him.  
      
       
     224 In his oral evidence Curry described going to the 777 Café on the evening of 5 April 1998 with May, Nanai and Colin, and said - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Who did you know there at the time? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I recall seeing Goran Mackic, Russell Oldham; I saw a guy by the name of Misha - 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Stopping there. Do you know what Misha’s full name is? 
          
         A. I believe it to be Lukic. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Sorry, I interrupted you. Who else did you see? 
          
         A. That is all I can recall. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was the appellant present at the club that day when you were there? 
          
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     225 Curry said that he spoke briefly to all the men he mentioned, and to May and Mullany, and that he gave May $1,000; he said that he had earlier been given the $1,000 by May in order to buy steroids for May from Mullany, but because Mullany did not have the steriods with him he gave the $1,000 back to May. He denied giving any money to Mullany. 
      
       
     226 Curry said that Nitrovic “approached me and asked me if I could lend him a hand for later on that evening”, saying “that a friend of his was in a bit of strife and wanted to see if I could help him with his problem”. Curry said - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did he tell you or give you any other details as to what the strife was? 
          
         A. He told me that we would have to go out to Bankstown. To my knowledge that was it, go out to Bankstown. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he tell you what you would be doing at Bankstown? 
          
         A. If need be show a degree of force, or along the mediation lines. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. As best you can what did he say to you Mr Curry? 
          
         A. That there was two different groups of guys getting together and if we were needed or called upon then we were to try and keep them apart from each other and try to mediate the situation. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You referred to the use of force in an earlier answer, Mr Nitrovic’s referred to the use of force? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did he say? 
          
         A. If need be and force was required we were to do that.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     227 Nitrovic gave Curry the keys to the BMW. Curry’s evidence continued - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You then drove the BMW is that correct? 
          
         A. Yes 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Tell the Court if you can who was in the BMW? 
          
         A. Myself in the driver’s seat. In the passenger’s side was Misha. Behind Misha driver’s side passenger seat was a friend of Misha’s, who I forgot to mention, who was at the Triple 7 that night. Directly behind me was Mark May. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. This friend of Misha’s, do you know his name? 
          
         A. No, I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you describe him” 
          
         A. He was thin, Mediterranean, longish sort of hair about four inches past his neck line. He was white or going grey on the sides. He had his hair up in a pony tail that night. I had never observed him to speak English. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say you had seen him at the Triple 7 Club? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was he with anyone? 
          
         A. He was with Mischa. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you able to estimate his age? 
          
         A. Late 40s. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you describe his hair? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did you describe it again, I missed that? 
          
         A. It was longish, about four inches past his neck line. It was whitening on the sides, going greyish on the sides and he had it up in a pony tail. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How would you describe his build? 
          
         A. Think. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he speak in the car? 
          
         A. No, not that I recall. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is there anything else you can recall about him? 
          
         A. I recall I was introduced to him through Misha and after Misha had introduced us he said something in a foreign language and all I could understand was my name and the guy’s just turned around and he just shook my hand.” 
         
        
        
       
     228 This was the first mention of Mischa’s friend. 
      
       
     229 Curry said that at the premises he saw Mackic, Mullany, Nanai, Nitrovic, Oldham, Puta, Mischa and Mischa’s friend. He said that he saw Mischa and Mischa’s friend in conversation with Puta when he (Curry) went into the house. He saw Puta later that evening, but did not again see Mischa and Mischa’s friend.  
      
       
     230 Nanai said that he was a passenger in a car which went to Bankstown on the evening of 5 April 1998; that he “assumed” that the other passengers were Mackic, Mullany, Nitrovic and Oldham; that he saw a black BMW parked at Bankstown in front of the car in which he was a passenger but did not see who was in it; and that walking to or at the house in Allum Street he also saw Curry, May and Puta. He said that there may have been more people, but that he did not see the appellant. Nanai did not name or describe Mischa or Mischa’s friend. 
      
       
     231 Puta initially said only that he was present at the premises on the evening of 5 April 1998; that he knew the appellant well; and that he did not see the appellant in or around the premises on that night. He gave no evidence of Mischa or Mischa’s friend, or of the two men whom Curry had said were in conversation with him.  
      
       
     232 After the leave to give further evidence in chief was given, Puta was asked about other people at the premises. He named a man called Eddie and a Turkish man called Ali, with much elaboration, and gave descriptions. He was talking to them in the hallway, and asked Eddie why so many people had come; Eddie replied, “Nothing is going to happen, just in case they try to be smart with us, we teach them a lesson”. After some more talk Puta went to get “them”, apparently Yildirim and Unsal. He did not see Eddie and Ali when he returned. At the end of this came the leading questions - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Do you know a man called Misha? 
          
         A. Yes, I know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you know what his full name is? 
          
         A. No, I know him because I see him in the club, big man. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see him on 5 April at any stage? 
          
         A. I saw him in the city but I didn’t see him any more. Maybe he was in the house, I am not sure. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t see him in the house? 
          
         A. I am not sure, could be there.” 
         
        
        
       
     233 It may be that it was hoped that in the further evidence in chief Puta would name Mischa and Mischa’s friend and say that he was in conversation with them. He did not, and on his evidence the men he was talking to were Eddie and Ali. 
      
       
     234 Nitrovic said that he was in the Ford when it and the BMW went to the premises on the evening of 5 April 1998, and - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Mr Nitrovic do you know who was in the black BMW when it drove from 777 Club to Marrickille and then Bankstown?  
          
         A. Not in the whole car. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who do you know was in the car? 
          
         A. Ray. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Ray Curry? 
          
         A. That is right. Misha. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who is Misha? 
          
         A. Just another bloke we know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you know his full name? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is it Mr Lijic [sic]? 
          
         A. Yes I think it is. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who else? 
          
         A. Mark May and another bloke, I don’t know his name at all. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you describe this other man? 
          
         A. Dark complexion, dark hair may be, that’s about it, really. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What about the length of his hair?  
          
         A. May be around his shoulders. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What would you estimate his age to be? 
          
         A. 40 something. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And do you know what nationality he was? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you ever hear him speak? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had you seen him on any other occasions? 
          
         A. I can’t be sure, I might have, might not have. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he, to your knowledge, have any acquaintanceship with the person Mischa? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. To your knowledge what was his link with Misha? 
          
         A. I don’t know, friends, I suppose. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did you know that they were friendly? 
          
         A. That night they were together. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you know the circumstances in which they had got into the BMW? 
          
         A. I can’t be specific, no.” 
         
        
        
        
         
        
       
     235 Nitrovic then gave evidence 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Now, at Allum Street are you able to say who was present at Allum Street on that evening? 
          
         A. I can’t be specific, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do best you can and tell us who was there? 
          
         A. Benny. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Benny Puta? 
          
         A. That’s correct. Myself, Russell, Goran, Carl, Nanai, Ray, Misha, Mark, that bloke that came with us. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That bloke you haven’t been able to give a name too [sic]? 
          
         A. I don’t know his name, and I think there was some other people too. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You think there were other people, are you able to give us names for the other persons? 
          
         A. No I don’t think I saw these people before. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you describe them please? 
          
         A. Dark complexion, older looking, maybe in the 40s too, I didn’t pay much attention to them because they were there, I think, before we got there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How many persons are you referring to? 
          
         A. I think there were only two. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Two men? 
          
         A. Yes. But I didn’t go, did we go – yeah I think it was only two. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was there any other person who came from the two cars to Allum Street other than the people you mentioned? 
          
         A. No, the other two were already there when we got there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where were they in the house? 
          
         A. I think it was around the corridor or living room. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have a conversation with these men? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see anyone confer with these men? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who had a conversation with them?  
          
         A. Benny. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That’s Mr Puta? 
          
         A. That is right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where was this conversation? 
          
         A. Around the corridor area I think. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where were you at that time? 
          
         A. I just walked in. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How far away from them were you at the time you observed this conversation? 
          
         A. I didn’t observe it, I heard it, we all went in together and they were talking.” 
         
        
        
       
     236 Nitrovic said that he and Curry left to move the cars, and when he returned he did not again see the two men who had been talking with Puta; nor did he again see Mischa or Mischa’s friend. He said that the appellant was not “anywhere in or around the Allum Street house” on 5 April 1998. 
      
       
     237 It will be seen that the evidence in chief of these witnesses in the appellant’s case went beyond evidence that they did not see the appellant or that the appellant was not at the premises on the evening of 5 April 1998. Curry and Nitrovic identified Mischa and his friend as passengers in the BMW. If they were passengers in the BMW, the other occupants of the car being Curry and May, they accounted for the older guy and the other man of whom May spoke and the older guy could not have been the appellant. Mackic identified Mischa as present at the premises, Curry and Nitrovic identified Mischa and Mischa’s friend as present at the premises, and Puta was led to the possibility that Mischa was at the premises. May and Mullany could have mistaken Mischa’s friend for the appellant. 
      
       
     238 This emergence of Mischa and Mischa’s friend, particularly coming as it did, was very much in question in the appeal. I have already referred to the appellant’s evidence at his trial of unsuccessfully asking Curry, Nitrovic and Puta who the older guy was; the complete evidence should now be appreciated - 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Have you ever asked Raymond Curry who was the older guy with long shoulder length straight black hair in his late 40’s, described by Mr May as being in the BMW that night? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he tell you? 
          
         A. Well he said it is Benny or Steve’s friend. Benny and Steve’s friend. Benny and Steve know him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who told you that? 
          
         A. Ray Curry. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you ask Benny or Steve who the friend was? 
          
         A. Yes.

      Travis Lawrence KNIGHT v REGINA 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Travis Lawrence Knight, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of armed robbery and asked that a charge of possessing heroin be taken into account on a Form 1. The learned sentencing judge sentenced him to imprisonment for 5 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
      
       
     2 The facts are quite unusual. In the small hours of the morning of 8 November 2000, the applicant went to the home of his girlfriend’s parents at Possum Creek on the far north coast of New South Wales. He was armed with a knife, he carried a torch and he was wearing a balaclava over his head. He turned off the electricity before entering the house through an unlocked door.  
      
       
     3 The victims were in bed. The applicant went to the bedroom and demanded money, attempting to disguise his voice. He told the female victim that he wanted her bag and he menaced both of them with the knife. The female victim realised who it was and remonstrated with him, but he said that he was serious and insisted on being given the bag. Eventually, he found it and he ran from the house. 
      
       
     4 He drove to Sydney with his girlfriend and two other people. There he obtained some heroin, which he used. He was arrested soon afterwards in a motel room, where police found a small amount of heroin the subject of the offence on the Form 1. As it happened, the female victim’s bag contained cash in excess of $5,000, a great deal more than the applicant had expected. He showed police where that money was and it was recovered. He made full admissions of the offence and pleaded guilty in the Local Court. 
      
       
     5 The applicant was nineteen years old at the time of the offence, and is now twenty one. He suffered injuries in a bicycle accident in 1997 and a car accident in 1999, which prevented his following in his father’s footsteps as a shearer. The psychological consequences of the accidents were serious. He became addicted to drugs which, his Honour found, was the result of the pain his injuries caused him. His only previous conviction is for possessing a prohibited drug, for which he was placed on a bond, although it should be noted that that bond was current at the time of the armed robbery. 
      
       
     6 The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was remorseful, and had a genuine desire to rehabilitate himself and defeat his drug dependence. His Honour also noted that he retained the support of his girlfriend. His Honour considered that the offence merited a sentence of 7 years imprisonment, which he reduced by twenty five percent in recognition of the early plea of guilty. In the light of the applicant’s subjective case, he found special circumstances. 
      
       
     7 In assessing the objective gravity of the offence, his Honour described it as “not well thought out” and not displaying “a great deal of planning or common sense …”. On the other hand, he noted that the female victim needed a dialysis machine, a fact of which the applicant was aware when he turned off the electricity at the house. Further, his Honour observed that there was no suggestion that the applicant knew of any particular times at which she underwent dialysis (although he may have thought it unlikely that she was doing so at the time of morning when the offence occurred.) Finally, his Honour accepted that both victims were terrified even though they were aware that the offender was the applicant. Particularly was this so of the female victim because of her medical condition, for reasons which she explained in evidence before his Honour. The male victim gave evidence that his initial bewilderment at the applicant’s behaviour turned to the apprehension that he might kill them to prevent his being identified. 
      
       
     8 His Honour had regard to the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. He considered that the case shared a number of the features expressed for the purpose of the guideline (para 162), but that it was distinguished by the fact that it was committed at the time it was in a private home. His Honour described this as “a significant and a very different aggravating circumstance …”. It was for this reason that he departed from the guideline of four to five years (para 165) and determined the starting point of seven years for the applicant’s sentence.  
      
       
     9 Before us this finding was challenged. Senior counsel for the applicant pointed out that one of the features of an armed robbery to which the court had regard in arriving at the range in Henry was a victim in a vulnerable position, such as a shopkeeper or a taxi driver: per Spigelman CJ at para 162(v). Counsel argued that offences committed in private homes should not be viewed more seriously than those committed against people, such as shopkeepers and taxi drivers, who are exposed to the public and against whom armed robberies are more prevalent. 
      
       
     10 The research of counsel on both sides produced only one decision of this Court since Henry dealing with an armed robbery in a private home: R v Campbell [2000] NSWCCA 157. That was a Crown appeal in which the court considered that a total sentence of at least eight or nine years imprisonment was called for but, in recognition of the element of double jeopardy in Crown appeals, imposed a total sentence of seven and a half years. However, the case is of little assistance for present purposes. The objective facts were very much more serious than the present case, and the offender was an older man than the present applicant with a bad criminal record. There were a number of features which led the court to conclude that a sentence well outside the Henry range was appropriate, although the fact that the offence was committed in a private home at night appears to have been one of the them: see the leading judgment of Dunford J at paras 22-25. 
      
       
     11 His Honour’s starting point in the present case is significantly higher than the Henry range. This is so even allowing for the fact that that range incorporates a measure of leniency for a late plea of guilty: R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at para 161. That said, I am not persuaded that his Honour fell into error in determining that a sentence above the guideline was called for. That is because of the aggravating features to which I have referred and, of course, I do not suggest that the same approach must be taken to every armed robbery by way of home invasion. 
      
       
     12 The question remains whether, in all the circumstances, the sentence which his Honour imposed is manifestly excessive. I have given this matter anxious consideration but, again, I am not persuaded that it was. True it is that the robbery was somewhat amateurish and the applicant made out a favourable subjective case. The fact remains that the offence was a serious one, committed while the applicant was on a bond. His Honour’s staring point of 7 years was high but, after a generous reduction for the plea of guilty and the finding of special circumstances, the resultant sentence of 5 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years is not such as to attract this Court’s intervention. 
      
       
     13 Senior counsel for the applicant referred us to R v Qi (1998) 102 A Crim R 172, a successful Crown appeal in which this Court sentenced the respondent to 4 years penal servitude, comprising a minimum term of 2 years and an additional term of 2 years. The respondent had pleaded guilty to armed robbery and asked that a related charge of kidnapping be taken into account. Like Campbell (supra), the facts of that case were considerably more serious than this and the respondent, who was about the same age as the present applicant, was also on conditional liberty at the time. On the other hand, he was one of a number of co-offenders and his role was found to be less than that of his companions. More importantly, the case was decided before Henry and, in any event, the Court was exercising the restraint customarily associated with re-sentence on a Crown appeal. 
      
       
     14 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     15 KIRBY J: I agree with Hidden J.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Steven Jordan, seeks leave to appeal against sentences passed upon him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to a charge of ongoing supply of cocaine (s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act) and a further charge of supplying cocaine (s 25 of the Act). The first charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, and the second charge 15 years. On the second charge the learned sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years to commence on 14 March 2000, the date he was taken into custody. On the first charge his Honour sentenced him to imprisonment for 3½ years, to commence at the expiration of the sentence on the second charge, with a non-parole period of 12 months. For the two charges, then, the effective sentence was 6½ years with a non-parole period of 4 years. 
      
       
     2 The applicant worked as a barman at a café in Kings Cross. Between 12 January and 3 February 2000 undercover police officers went to the café and bought cocaine from the applicant on five separate occasions. The first four purchases were each of one gram at a price of $200, and the last was for three grams at a cost of $550. On each occasion the cocaine was about thirty percent pure. It was this series of events which gave rise to the first charge, supplying cocaine on an ongoing basis. 
      
       
     3 The applicant was arrested on 14 March 2000. He was taken to the flat above the café where he lived, so that the police could search it. There the police found, or were shown by the applicant, a quantity of cocaine contained in plastic bags, together with a set of scales and other paraphernalia commonly associated with the supply of drugs. The cocaine at the flat weighed a little under 62 grams and, again, was about thirty percent pure. 
      
       
     4 His Honour found that the applicant was conducting a business of selling cocaine at the café and he characterised him as “in effect, a street dealer of the drug …”. From the cocaine and other items found at the flat, he concluded that the applicant was breaking down the drug and packaging it for sale. His Honour saw the two offences as arising “out of the same course of criminal activity”, and said that it was his intention to punish the applicant for the totality of the criminality disclosed by those offences. He decided that the matter should be dealt with by way of cumulative sentences, referring to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. However, he expressed his approach to his sentencing task in this way:  
      
       
        
         
         “It makes little difference how the sentences are structured in respect of this matter, provided that, at the end of the day, the totality of the criminality is represented by the sentence imposed upon the prisoner, and no more than the totality of the criminality is punished.” 
         
        
       
     5 For present purposes, the applicant’s subjective case may be stated briefly. He was fifty one years old at the time of the offences and is now fifty three. He came to this country from Czechoslovakia in 1968. He has no family here and appears to have made few close friends, living what his Honour described as “a relatively lonely existence”. He developed a dependence on cocaine, together with a gambling problem. He has some criminal record, the only entry of significance being a conviction in the District Court in 1992 for supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine, for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 
      
       
     6 He has for some years suffered from a mental illness, apparently paranoid schizophrenia, the effects of which have been aggravated by his use of cocaine. His Honour accepted that he was supplying the drug to finance his own addiction, as well as his gambling. His Honour also took into account the fact that he pleaded guilty to the charges at the earliest opportunity and, in the light of his background and mental illness, found special circumstances. 
      
       
     7 In this Court counsel for the applicant submitted that his Honour erred in accumulating the sentences as he did, so as to arrive at a total sentence which was manifestly excessive. In my view, this submission is sound. True it is that the second charge arose out of the applicant’s possession of cocaine a little over a month after the last of the transactions giving rise to the first charge. Nevertheless, as I have said, his Honour treated the two charges as the products of the same course of criminal activity. To view them in this way was consistent with authority of this Court dealing with the offence of ongoing supply of a drug. In R v Smiroldo (2000) 112 A Crim R 47, Hulme J said (at 50): 
      
       
        
         
         “The persons at whom at s 25A is directed are those who appear to be indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs. It must, it seems to me, be relevant to consider the magnitude of such an operation.” 
         
        
       
     8 In R v Hoon and Pouoa [2000] NSW CCA 137, Dunford J said of s 25A (at para 39): 
      
       
        
         
         “The section is directed to the concepts of repetition, system and organisation, and the objective criminality of any offence under the section should be determined by reference to those features, and not merely to the number and quantities of individual instances of supply.” 
         
        
       
     9 The Crown prosecutor referred us to R v Plane (CCA, unreported, 10 April 1990), in which this Court refused leave to appeal against cumulative sentences passed in respect of a charge of actual supply of heroin and a related charge of deemed supply of the same drug. However, that case was not dealing with a charge of ongoing supply (which did not then exist) and, more importantly, it does not appear that the accumulation was the subject of any complaint in argument. The court appears to have approached the matter on the basis that the sum of the accumulated sentences was appropriate for the whole of the criminality disclosed. It should be noted that the case was decided well before the decision of the High Court in Pearce (supra). In addition, the sentences were passed under the Probation and Parole Act 1983 and argument appears to have been directed primarily to the length of the non-parole period which, in accordance with that act, was fixed globally in respect of the two head sentences. 
      
       
     10 In R v Scevola [2001] NSW CCA 430, a case also involving charges of ongoing supply and supply of cocaine, the sentencing judge passed concurrent sentences. However, it should be noted that in that case the second charge arose from the offender’s possession of cocaine less than two weeks after the transaction the subject of the first charge. His Honour could have passed concurrent sentences in the present case but, given the length of time which elapsed between the events giving rise to the two charges, he need not have done so. Partial accumulation was open and, in my view, would have been the appropriate course. 
      
       
     11 Counsel for the applicant referred us to a number of cases in which this Court has considered sentences for the ongoing supply of drugs. In Scevola, upon an application by the offender for leave to appeal, the court declined to interfere with concurrent sentences of imprisonment for 4 years and 3 months. In the other cases the court affirmed, or itself imposed, terms of imprisonment ranging from 14 months to 5 years. Most of them involved the ongoing supply of heroin. At the bottom of that range were Hoon and Pouoa (supra) and  R v Thompson [2000] NSWCCA 362, and at the top of it was R v Tipler [2000] NSWCCA 382. 
      
       
     12 In Hoon and Pouoa and Thompson there were special considerations warranting leniency. In Tipler, on the other hand, the sentencing judge took into account seven drug related offences on a Form 1. In most of the other cases the sentence was in the order of 3 years. Insofar as these cases demonstrate a range, the effective sentence of 6 ½ years in the present case is clearly outside it. However, a sentence at the top of that range or a little above it is called for, not only because of the lapse of time between the two offences but also because of the quantity of the drug found at the applicant’s premises and his prior conviction for a serious drug offence. 
      
       
     13 Viewed individually, no exception could be taken to the sentences passed on each charge. However, the fact that one was wholly accumulated upon the other has resulted in an overall sentence greater than was appropriate to reflect the applicant’s criminality. In my view, the effective sentence should be imprisonment for 5 ½ years with a non-parole period of 3 years. I would achieve this by directing the sentence on the second charge to commence one year earlier than the date specified by his Honour.  
      
       
     14 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. On the second charge I would confirm the fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 14 March 2000. On the first charge I would confirm the sentence of imprisonment for 3 ½ years with a non-parole period of 12 months, but I would direct that that sentence commence on 14 March 2002. The applicant would be eligible for release on parole on 14 March 2003. 
      
       
     15 BUDDIN J: I agree.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Dunford J: The appellants, Raymond Richard Johnson and Tony Olivieri, have appealed against their convictions for conspiracy to prevent, obstruct or dissuade witnesses from attending a judicial proceeding contrary to s 325(1A) Crimes Act 1900, following their trial before his Honour Acting Judge Davidson QC in the District Court at Sydney. Following their convictions, each appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for concurrent terms of 2 years with non-parole periods of 18 months.  
      
       
     2 The substance of the charges was that the appellants agreed that one of the appellants, Tony Olivieri, or both of them, would go to Toowoomba in Queensland and there prevent, obstruct or dissuade Barry O’Donnell and Vicky Robertson from attending the trial of the appellant, Raymond Richard Johnson, in the District Court at Sydney. The overt acts relied on to prove the conspiracy were the presence and activities of the appellant Olivieri and, possibly another man, in Toowoomba, on the evening of Sunday 8 February and the morning of Monday 9 February 1998. The evidence in the Crown case may be summarised as follows. 
      
       
     3 In February 1998, Vicky Robertson and Barry O’Donnell had been living at 50 Joyce Street, Toowoomba, Queensland for almost 4 years. Previously they lived in Sydney where they had known the appellants Olivieri and Johnson. They had socialised with Olivieri on one or two occasions but had had more frequent contact with Johnson. O’Donnell often trained at the gym with Johnson.  
      
       
     4 In 1995 O’Donnell and Robertson had a falling out with the appellant Johnson, and as a result Robertson and O’Donnell provided statements to the police as complainants in respect of an alleged serious criminal offence. Johnson’s trial in respect of such serious criminal offence was pending as at 9 February 1988 and was scheduled to commence on 30 November 1998 in the District Court at Sydney. Robertson and O’Donnell as complainants were required to appear as witnesses for the Crown at such trial. 
      
       
     5 On 3 February 1998 a Toyota Camry with number plates 138-EAT was rented from Network Rentals in Seven Hills, Sydney by a person using the name Peter Watts. Peter Watts was not able to be otherwise identified and the assistant manager of Network Rentals who arranged the rental of the vehicle to the person using that name was unable to identify him in a video array containing photographs of a number of men including the two appellants. 
      
       
     6 At about 11 or 11.30pm on Sunday 8 February 1998, David Parry and his wife Kayelene who lived at 9 Sheehan Street, Toowoomba observed a white vehicle parked in Searle Street nearby. They later heard the sound of three car doors slamming, and about 5 to 10 minutes later, Mr Parry observed that the white vehicle had moved from Searle Street to Sheehan Street, being parked on the same side of the road as his house and pointing towards Short Street. Armed with a torch, Mr Parry went and had a look at the vehicle and saw that there was no-one in it. He suspected that the vehicle might have been involved in the buying or selling of drugs, and as a result he telephoned the police.  
      
       
     7 At about 12.51am the following morning (Monday, 9 February) police received a call to attend Sheehan Street. Upon their arrival they observed a white Toyota Camry bearing registration plates 244-PZE parked at the western side of Sheehan Street facing east, approximately 24 metres from Searle Street. A registration check of the vehicle showed that the number plates on it were stolen and had been stolen between 17 May and 4 June the previous year.  
      
       
     8 Using a torch Constable Greenwood looked into the vehicle and observed a number of objects. The boot was locked. Other police arrived and took up surveillance positions. 
      
       
     9 At approximately 4.10am, Constable Cox saw a male person, later identified as the appellant Olivieri, walk from the Short Street end of Sheehan Street towards the white Camry. He was wearing black tracksuit pants, a tan chequered flannelette-type jacket, dark sneakers and was clutching a black backpack to his chest. He entered the driver’s side of the white Camry. Constable Cox ran from his position towards the Camry, flashed his torch at the appellant Olivieri inside the vehicle and shouted for him to get out. Olivieri started the vehicle, whereupon Constable Cox used his torch to smash the driver’s window, he reached into the car and removed the keys from the ignition. Olivieri was removed from the car whereupon Constable Lear, who was also present noticed, that Olivieri’s sneakers and lower portions of his tracksuit pants were partially covered in red mud. He also appeared to be wet, although it had not rained since before 3am. 
      
       
     10 Constable Greenwood looked into the vehicle and saw a black backpack with a torch in it and a balaclava and a pair of gloves. Constable Cox unlocked the boot with the keys and saw a wallet sitting on top of a black sports bag. The wallet was located in the rear quarter of the vehicle on the driver’s side. The bag appeared to be closed. On opening the wallet, Constable Cox observed that it contained a large bundle of hundred dollar notes and a credit card in the name of RR Johnson.  
      
       
     11 Olivieri was conveyed to Toowoomba Police Station where he declined to be interviewed. Subsequently, the white Camry vehicle was taken to Toowoomba Police Station where it was searched, largely in the presence of Olivieri, and the following items were recovered from the vehicle: 
      
       
        
         
         1. a black wallet containing $1,590 in cash containing the identification of the appellant Johnson; 
          
         2. a blue Nikko back pack; 
          
         3. 20 plastic cable ties (in the back pack); 
          
         4. a pair of scissors (in the back pack); 
          
         5. silver tape (also described as duct or Gaffa tape – in the back pack) 
          
         6. a pair of pink rubber gloves (in the back pack); 
          
         7. a pair of black gloves; 
          
         8. a black balaclava; 
         
        
       
     9. 3 torches (2 of which were in the back pack and one in the front of the car); 
      
       
        
         
         10. 2 Tasco binocular cases; 
          
         11. $6,000 in cash in a pillowcase in the back seat of the vehicle; 
          
         12. a TEAC AM/FM cassette Walkman; 
          
         13. 2 Digitor handheld receivers (walkie-talkies); 
          
         14. 3 earpieces with 2 adaptors and a transmitter; 
          
         15. a listening device in silver tape; 
          
         16. 1 black case containing another listening device, 2 antennae, 2 receivers and an earpiece; 
          
         17. a box of Normison (later identified as belonging to the appellant Johnson) and a box of Mersyndol tablets. 
         
        
       
     12 A latent fingerprint on the face of the Eveready 9 volt snap-on battery from one of the walkie-talkies was later developed and identified as being from the right thumb of the appellant Johnson. 
      
       
     13 On 11 March 1999, the two Digitor receivers (walkie-talkies) were tested and were found to operate satisfactorily at a range of approximately 50 metres, whilst on 25 March, police went to 50 Joyce Street (the home of Vicky Robertson and Barry O’Donnell) and conducted testing on the two listening devices. The wall bug kit was adhered to the outside of a window and it was found to be operating and able to be received by the FM receiver within a proximity of 20 metres but the quality and stability of the reception was not very good. They then tested the boxed set by placing the transmitter on a cabinet in the lounge room of 50 Joyce Street and clear reception from the lounge room and adjacent rooms was detectable over a distance of 150 metres. 
      
       
     14 Evidence was given by Sergeant Lojek that when he received all the listening device objects they were all in working order, although the batteries had to be replaced, but there was no evidence that any of the listening devices were ever used in or around 50 Joyce Street. 
      
       
     15 Whilst the search of the Camry car was being conducted in the presence of the appellant Olivieri, his comments were recorded using a micro cassette recorder. In relation to the $1,590 found in the wallet, he stated that the money was his and that he received it as proceeds from selling copper which had been stolen in Esk, but inquiries by police established that there had been no report of any copper being stolen in Esk. 
      
       
     16 In relation to the false number plates on the white Camry, the appellant Olivieri stated that he did not know where they came from. He said that he borrowed the car from someone for a cost of $800 up front, and was required to pay the sum of $1,000 upon the cars return.  
      
       
     17 In relation to the $6,000 found in a pillowcase in the vehicle, he stated that he did not know anything about the money, but said that it could have been left in the vehicle by one of the two hitchhikers which he had picked up. 
      
       
     18 He was shown the backpack which was found in the vehicle and a number of other items and stated that he used the plastic ties and the pink rubber gloves in his scaffolding business, that he had not been wearing the black leather gloves on the night of his apprehension, that he used the three torches to see in the dark, and that he used the scissors to cut mesh or his toenails whilst at work. He denied knowledge of the black balaclava and stated that he had never worn it. 
      
       
     19 Meanwhile, between 2.30 and 3am other witnesses, Nathan Chaloner and Anthony Hughes, who were walking towards the Robertson/O’Donnell home at 50 Joyce Street for the purposes of getting a lift to their employment, saw a male person standing on the corner of Joyce and Diagonal Street facing towards 50 Joyce Street, but when he heard them he ran away. He was described as 170 to 175 cm tall with a slim to medium build wearing black shoes, long trousers, long black sleeved top and a black beanie, possibly a balaclava, which was worn pulled up at the front and back covering his head and ears, and he appeared to have something on his back like a back pack.  
      
       
     20 Shortly afterwards, Vicky Robertson saw a person dressed in dark clothing standing on the property of the house across the road from her own, but she only saw him for a couple of seconds. About 20 minutes after Olivieri was taken to Toowoomba Police Station, Constable Greenwood saw a male person walking along Searle Street at a quick pace but he lost sight of him and was unable to locate him. He described the person as a Caucasian male aged between 35 and 45, about 175 cm tall with a medium to solid build with short hair wearing dark coloured slacks and a dark coloured top. 
      
       
     21 On 9 February police examined the house at 50 Joyce Street, the surrounding streets and the railway line cutting area, noticing in particular an area of flattened grass near the railway line on its northern side near the chain mesh fence from Diagonal Street. It was located about 50 metres to the east of 50 Joyce Street, and there was also a larger area of flattened grass measuring 15 metres by 5 metres directly behind the residence.  
      
       
     22 Sergeant Keck also noted three individual shoe impressions in the red soil and made yellow stone casts of these impressions. Later examination concluded that the partial shoe sole impressions on the three casts showed similar class characteristics to the left out-sole of the black sneakers worn by Olivieri at the time he was arrested, that is, they showed similar, but not identical patterns to the impressions on the casts. 
      
       
     23 The appellant Olivieri did not give evidence and called no evidence in his case. 
      
       
     24 The appellant Johnson gave evidence denying any involvement in the case against him, and gave and led alibi evidence as to his movements on Saturday 6 to Monday 9 February 1998, to the effect that he was in Sydney that whole time. He also gave evidence of meeting Olivieri at the Squashlands Gymnasium in Sydney on Thursday 5 February which it was claimed could provide an explanation for some of his possessions such as his wallet and the Normison tablets being in the car driven by Olivieri. 
      
       
     25 He said he had never been to Toowoomba and did not know the whereabouts of Vicky Robertson or Barry O’Donnell in 1998 having last seen them in 1995. He did not find out that Olivieri had been in Toowoomba until the latter called him on 11 or 12 February and told him that he had been arrested there over the weekend and that the police had taken possession of his (Johnson’s) wallet.  
      
       
     26 The Amended Grounds of Appeal relied on by the appellant Olivieri are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The trial Judge erred in failing to direct a verdict of not guilty to be returned in respect of the appellant. 
          
         2. The verdict is unreasonable, cannot be supported having regard to the evidence and/or otherwise represents a miscarriage of justice. 
          
         3. The trial Judge erred in admitting into evidence a taped conversation between the appellant and the police. 
          
         4. The trial Judge erred and the trial miscarried in that the Crown was permitted to put its case on an alternative factual basis when the trial, on behalf of both accused, had been run on a particular basis, namely that it was the Crown case that the two accused were together in Toowoomba, Queensland at the relevant time, that is 8-9 March 1998. 
          
         5. The trial Judge erred in his direction to the Jury in relation to circumstantial evidence. 
          
         6. The trial Judge erred in his directions to the Jury in relation to the “co-conspirators’” rule. 
         
        
       
     27 The Grounds of Appeal filed on behalf of the appellant Johnson are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The trial Judge erred in not granting the appellant a separate trial. 
          
         2. The trial Judge erred in his directions to the Jury in relation to circumstantial evidence. 
          
         3. The trial Judge erred in his summing up to the Jury. 
          
         4. The learned trial Judge erred in failing to direct verdicts of acquittal at the conclusion of the evidence for the Crown. 
          
         5. The change in the Crown case. 
          
         6. That having regard to the evidence in the case as a whole the verdict of the Jury is unreasonable in that it should have had a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt of the two counts alleged against him. 
         
        
       
     28 However, at the hearing of the Appeal Mr. Byrne SC, on behalf of the appellant Johnson, indicated that he relied on grounds similar to those numbered 1 to 2 in the Amended Grounds of Appeal relied on by the appellant Olivieri, and it is convenient to deal firstly with those grounds. 
      
       
     29 The Crown case was that the appellants conspired with each other to commit an offence contrary to s 325(1A) of the Crimes Act 1900, which provides as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “A person who without lawful excuse wilfully prevents, obstructs or dissuades another person who the person believes may be called as a witness in any judicial proceeding from attending the proceeding is liable to imprisonment for 5 years.” 
         
        
       
     30 It was therefore necessary not only to prove the agreement or conspiracy and that both appellants were parties to such conspiracy, but also to prove that the agreement was to prevent a breach of that subsection, that is, to “prevent, obstruct or dissuade” each of the complainants in the case against the appellant Johnson from attending his trial.  
      
       
     31 Although complaint has been made about his Honour’s directions in relation to circumstantial evidence and the co-conspirators’ rule, I am prepared to accept for present purposes that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence from which it could be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that there was an agreement between the two appellants which could amount to a conspiracy to do something unlawful. This is based on the established friendship between them and the presence in the motor vehicle which the appellant Olivieri was driving of a number of items belonging to the appellant Johnson, including his wallet, credit card, address book, motor driver’s license and $1,590 which the appellant Johnson claimed belonged to him. There were also two walkie-talkies in the vehicle, which the appellant Johnson claimed were his, and which suggested that two or more people were intending to communicate with each other, and also two sets of binocular cases (although no binoculars). 
      
       
     32 These matters all indicated the presence of both appellants together in Toowoomba pursuant to some form of agreement, and having regard to the nature of the items in the motor vehicle, e.g. the crow bar, the walkie-talkies, listening devices, gloves and balaclava (in Toowoomba in February) that they were there for some unlawful purpose. 
      
       
     33 Although the Crown’s primary case was that Johnson was present in Toowoomba with Olivieri, its case was also put in the alternative that the conspiracy having been entered into in Sydney between the two appellants, only Olivieri went to Toowoomba to carry out its purpose, and in this way the Crown sought to avoid the effect of Johnson’s alibi evidence. The alternative case was objected to at the trial and his Honour permitting the Crown to run such alternative case is also the subject of grounds in this appeal. 
      
       
     34 Putting that aside for the moment, it was in my opinion open to the Jury to either reject the alibi evidence and find both appellants were present in Toowoomba over the weekend of 8/9 February 1998, or to have a doubt on that point but nevertheless still be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a conspiracy between the appellants (even if Johnson remained in Sydney) to effect an unlawful purpose in Toowoomba. 
      
       
     35 However, having said all that, one looks to see what evidence there was as to the object of the conspiracy. Mr O’Donnell and Mrs Robertson were the complainants in the pending Court case against Johnson, and as complainants it would be expected that they would be called to give evidence in that trial. Olivieri was not involved in that trial but the Jury could easily and legitimately infer that he could have been told about it by Johnson. 
      
       
     36 But given all these circumstances, one looks for evidence, direct or circumstantial, as to what it was the appellant Olivieri or both appellants were intending to do to Mr O’Donnell and Mrs Robertson pursuant to the agreement between them. 
      
       
     37 Division 3 of Part 9 (ss 320-326) of the Crimes Act contains a number of offences relating to interference with judicial officers, witnesses, jurors, etc including corruption of witnesses (s 321), threatening or intimidating witnesses (s 322), acting with intent to influence a witness to give false evidence (s 323), as well as s 325. In the present case it was necessary for the Crown to prove that the agreement or conspiracy between the appellants was to “prevent, obstruct or dissuade” the persons named from attending the trial. 
      
       
     38 In my view there was no evidence from which the Jury acting reasonably could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this is what Olivieri (and possibly Johnson) were there for. The presence of the crowbar, torches and balaclava was consistent with an intention to burgle or rob, the listening devices could have been used in a number of ways, e.g. eavesdropping, seeking material to discredit the complainants as witnesses at the trial, and the $6,000 cash is consistent with an intention to bribe them, or consistent with an intention to purchase drugs. Another possibility is that it was intended by force, or persuasion, to induce the complainants to change the evidence which they intended to give at Johnson’s trial, either by withdrawing their original statements or otherwise. If that was the object of the conspiracy, it was a conspiracy to commit an offence under s 322 or 323, or if it involved the payment of money or other benefit, an offence under s 321, but not an offence under s 325(1A). 
      
       
     39 Alternatively the objective may have been to bug the premises in an effort to obtain material for cross-examination, which could be used in an attempt to discredit the complainants as witnesses at the trial. 
      
       
     40 Whilst in the circumstances of the case, particularly the co-incidence that Olivieri (alone or with Johnson) was outside 50 Joyce Street, Toowoomba where the complainants lived, I believe it was open to the Jury to be satisfied that his or their presence (and therefore the conspiracy) was related to the appellant Johnson’s pending trial and the complainants’ position as witnesses, I do not see how it was open to the Jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the intention was to prevent, obstruct or persuade them not to attend contrary to s 325(1A), as opposed to one of the other activities prohibited by the sections I have referred to. 
      
       
     41 It follows that it does not matter whether his Honour should have directed verdicts of acquittal at the end of the Crown case, because on the whole of the evidence the verdicts of the Jury are unreasonable and cannot be supported: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. I therefore propose that in respect of each appellant, the appeal be upheld, the convictions quashed and judgments and verdicts of acquittal entered. 
      
       
     42 Giles JA: I agree. 
      
       
     43 Adams J: I also agree.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GILES, JA: On the conviction appeal, we have reached a concluded view although it is a matter on which we wish to give reserved reasons. We order that the appeal be dismissed and we will give our reasons later.  
      
       
     2 We have also reached a concluded view on the application for leave to appeal against sentence and are in a position to deal with that matter immediately. I would ask Justice Greg James to give the first reasons. 
      
       
     3 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for three years together with a non parole period of 18 months imposed upon the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales for the offence of robbery in company.  
      
       
     4 The sentence was to date from 28 August 2001 and the trial judge in delivering sentence directed that the prisoner be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. That expiration was fixed as occurring on 27 February 2003. His Honour found special circumstances. I will return to that matter later. 
      
       
     5 The short facts of the offence, of which the applicant was convicted, were that he, in the company of two other Asian boys, at the Bankstown bus station in Bankstown Square at about 8.00 am robbed a 15 year old Year 10 high school student asking him for his money, his wallet and his pin number. 
      
       
     6 The three robbers approached a group of students and then just as the victim was about to join a bus queue, one of them asked for his money and wallet. The boys appeared to the victim to be aged about 16 or 17 years old, that is a couple of years older than he was. He identified the applicant as one of the three boys and the one that grabbed him by the blazer and told him, in Vietnamese, to sit down, pushed him back down into a seat and stepped on his left foot immobilising him. It was the applicant, he said, who demanded his money or wallet.  
      
       
     7 The applicant removed $20 from the wallet. The key card contained in the wallet was identified but the victim gave a false number when asked for the pin number. He was asked if he had money in his key card account and said there was just under $10. The card and wallet were thrown back to him and the boys left. 
      
       
     8 Subsequently he identified the applicant on another occasion some eight days later at Bankstown Plaza.  
      
       
     9 In his remarks on sentence the learned trial judge referred to these things and to the absence of any evidence of planning or premeditation. He was of the view there was no evidence to suggest that this was anything other than an opportunistic crime. He concluded it did not reveal a high degree of planning, that the victim was not in that unusually vulnerable condition of service station proprietors and others, although his Honour did have regard to the vulnerability of a school boy utilising public transport and having in that regard to make use of public facilities. 
      
       
     10 His Honour referred to the guideline judgment in The Queen v. Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and came to the conclusion, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offences, that the case fell outside the guideline notwithstanding it was an offence of robbery in company, to which offences The Queen v. Murchie (1999) NSW CCA 424, held that the guideline should extend. 
      
       
     11 His Honour concluded that the offender was young and although he had a similar offence on his record (that appears to be a reference to an offence of stealing from a person), for which he had received a community service order, which he had apparently completed without incident; that he should be regarded as a person akin to a first offender, at least, at this level of crime. But his Honour was of the view that he should depart from the range suggested in Henry (supra) because the objective circumstances of the offence were not as serious as those to which that guideline related. 
      
       
     12 The applicant came forward for sentence aged 21 years. His Honour did refer to the other drug related offences the applicant had committed since this offence, but disregarded them in the sentencing process except to the extent that the Probation and Parole Service had, in a report which was before him made reference to them. In that report, the Probation and Parole office suggested that Mr. Nguyen was a young man who appeared to be making a serious effort to lead a stable drug free lifestyle, ""he was open in his discussions and co operated with this service in the course of his probation and preparation of this report"".  
      
       
     13 He was assessed as suitable for various non custodial alternatives to imprisonment but it was considered that his supervised bond having expired, there would be little benefit to be gained from further supervision from the service. 
      
       
     14 His Honour had regard to the applicant's prior drug usage and, in particular to the favourable report by Mr. Champion, psychologist.  
      
       
     15 The references that were tendered on his behalf attracted favourable consideration from his Honour. When he had been in custody he was apparently assaulted and for some time in his custodial history special measures had to be taken in consequence of that matter. 
      
       
     16 Before us, to be taken into account on the question of re sentencing was an affidavit setting out the circumstances of the offender's present confinement. That affidavit has annexed to it a report by an officer of the Adult Education and Vocational Training Institute at the Oberon Campus. It establishes that the applicant is at the Oberon Young Offender Correctional Centre but was due to return to the John Moroney Correctional Centre on 20 June 2002.  
      
       
     17 The trial judge correctly took the view that it was a serious offence. He correctly took the view that there had to be a full time custodial sentence. He correctly took the view that the sentence had to contain elements of general and personal deterrence. He concluded that although the applicant was still young his youth should not provide a cloak or shield of convenience for the commission of the offence, but he found special circumstances. They were the applicant’s youth, that this was his first full-time custodial sentence and the prospects of his rehabilitation, which on the material seemed high.  
      
       
     18 The sentence, however, is excessive. It was a very severe sentence indeed having regard to the objective circumstances of the crime and having regard to the very matters to which his Honour had reference when he found special circumstances. 
      
       
     19 I am of the view that that sentence so far exceeds what was called for in all the circumstances of the offence as to indicate that his Honour had fallen into the kind of error identified in House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, such as to pass a sentence which, having regard to the totality of the circumstances, was unreasonable. 
      
       
     20 In those circumstances, s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 requires that the court should intervene if some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. In that regard, I would make particular reference to what is contained in the report of Mr. Sibley, the Adult Education and Vocational Training Institute officer, to which I have referred and, in particular, that it appears that the applicant has thoroughly justified the expression of hope in his rehabilitative prospects made by the trial judge, so far, in his achievements whilst in custody.  
      
       
     21 In my view, the application for leave to appeal against sentence should be allowed, the appeal upheld, the sentence passed by the learned trial judge should be quashed, and in lieu thereof the applicant should be sentenced to a period of imprisonment for a period of two years to date from 28 August 2001 and expire on 27 August 2003 with a non-parole period of 12 months fixed in relation to that sentence to expire on 27 August 2002. 
      
       
     22 I note that I share his Honour’s views of the applicant’s special circumstances and find then accordingly and in addition in accordance with the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I note that the applicant’s release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period should be directed. 
      
       
     23 GILES, JA: I agree. 
      
       
     24 DUNFORD, J: I also agree. 
      
       
     25 GILES, JA: The orders will, therefore be as proposed by Justice Greg James.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: On 7 May 2001, the appellant was arraigned on an indictment containing two counts.  
      
       
     2 The first charged that the appellant on 7 September 1995 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being a witness at a hearing before the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, knowingly gave false testimony, namely, that he had never engaged in any form of illegal conduct, which was testimony touching a matter material in an inquiry being made by the said Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. 
      
       
     3 The second charged that the appellant on 12 September 1995 at Green Point in the State of New South Wales, did incite Therese Hart to supply a prohibited drug, namely, 3,4 Methylenedioxyamphetamine (Ecstasy). 
      
       
     4 The appellant pleaded not guilty to both counts. A trial before Kinchington DCJ and a jury commenced on 14 May 2001, and concluded on 18 May 2001, with a guilty verdict on both counts. The appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of fifteen months imprisonment on the first count, and a cumulative sentence of six months on the second count.  
      
       
     5 The appellant has appealed to this Court against his conviction on two grounds: 
      
       
        
         
         The learned trial judge erred in admitting into evidence at the trial of the appellant transcripts of evidence before the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service that contained evidence of conversations obtained in contravention of s.5 of the Listening Devices Act 1984. 
          
          
         The learned trial judge erred in ruling that the appellant had a case to answer in relation to the charge of inciting the supply of a prohibited drug having regard to the particulars relied upon by the Crown. 
         
        
       
     6 The case involved a consideration of the effect of ss.12 and 13 of the Listening Devices Act 1984 (NSW), which are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         12. In this Part, a reference to the giving of evidence of a private conversation that has come to the knowledge of a person as a result of the use of a listening device includes a reference to the production of a record of such a private conversation.  
          
          
         13(1) Where a private conversation has come to the knowledge of a person as a result, direct or indirect, of the use of a listening device in contravention of section 5:  
          
         (a) evidence of the conversation, and  
          
         (b) evidence obtained as a direct consequence of the conversation so coming to the knowledge of that person,  
          
         may not be given by that person in any civil or criminal proceedings (including proceedings for or in connection with the grant of bail).  
          
         (2) Subsection (1) does not render any evidence inadmissible:  
          
         (a) if all of the principal parties to the private conversation concerned consent to the evidence being given,  
          
         (b) if the private conversation concerned comes to the knowledge of the person called to give the evidence otherwise than in the manner referred to in that subsection, notwithstanding that the person also obtained knowledge of the conversation in such a manner,  
          
         (c) in proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations, or  
          
         (d) in proceedings for:  
          
           
           (i) an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or for 20 years or more, or  
            
           (ii) a serious narcotics offence,  
            
           (or in proceedings for or in connection with the grant of bail in any such proceedings) if the court considers that the evidence should be admissible.  
           
          
         (3) In determining whether to admit evidence as referred to in subsection (2) (d), the court shall:  
          
         (a) be guided by the public interest, including where relevant the public interest in:  
          
           
           (i) upholding the law,  
            
           (ii) protecting people from illegal or unfair treatment, and  
            
           (iii) punishing those guilty of offences, and  
           
          
         (b) have regard to all relevant matters, including:  
          
           
           (i) the seriousness of the offence in relation to which the evidence is sought to be admitted, and  
            
           (ii) the nature of the contravention of section 5 concerned.  
           
          
         (4) The court before which any proceedings referred to in subsection (2) (c) or (d) are brought may, at any stage of the proceedings and from time to time, make an order forbidding publication of any evidence, or of any report of, or report of the substance, meaning or purport of, any evidence referred to in subsection (2) (c) or (d).  
          
         (5) A person shall not contravene an order made under subsection (4).  
          
         Maximum penalty (subsection (5)): 20 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of 12 months, or both.  
         
        
       
     7 It is common ground that the second count amounted to a charge of “a serious narcotics offence” within s.13(2)(d)(ii). The following definition of “private conversation” appears in s.3(1) of the Act: 
      
       
        
         
         ""private conversation"" means any words spoken by one person to another person or to other persons in circumstances that may reasonably be taken to indicate that any of those persons desires the words to be listened to only:  
          
         (a) by themselves, or  
          
         (b) by themselves and by some other person who has the consent, express or implied, of all of those persons to do so.  
         
        
        
       CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
     8 The appellant was a serving police officer in 1995. In May 1995, he was served with a summons to attend the Police Royal Commission as a witness. On 25 August 1995, warrants were obtained, purportedly under the Listening Devices Act, to install listening devices in premises owned by one Ms. Hart.  
      
       
     9 The appellant visited those premises on 27 August 1995, 30 August 1995, and 12 September 1995, and his conversations with Ms. Hart on those occasions were recorded on audio and video tapes.  
      
       
     10 The appellant gave evidence at the Police Royal Commission on 7 September 1995 and 11 December 1995. On the former occasion, he gave evidence that he had never engaged in any form of corrupt or illegal conduct. On the latter occasion, he was cross-examined on the basis of the recording of his conversations with Ms. Hart. He was later charged with the offences identified above.  
      
       
     11 The matter came on for trial before Kinchington DCJ. Before a jury was empanelled, Counsel for the appellant sought a ruling as to the admissibility of evidence obtained as a result of the use of listening devices. Kinchington DCJ ruled that the evidence should be admitted. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, and the appeal against this ruling was upheld (R. v. Eade [2000] NSWCCA 369).  
      
       
     12 The Court of Appeal held that the warrants obtained on 25 August 1995 were invalid, so that the giving of evidence resulting from the use of listening devices was restricted by s.13 of the Listening Devices Act. However, the Court of Appeal ruled that s.13 does not exclude evidence by a principal party to the conversation which was illegally recorded, and that the admission of the recording must be determined under s.138 of the Evidence Act, the onus being on the Crown.  
      
       
     13 In his judgment on this point, Greg James J said the following: 
      
       
        
         
         For myself, I add that the submissions on behalf of the appellant that s.13 of the Listening Devices Act 1984 would permit, in the exercise of discretion, evidence of the conversation to be led on count one, but would bar that evidence on count two, appear to have been based upon a view that s.13(3) applies whether evidence of the conversation were to be given by Ms. Hart or any other witness. But the position may be different, depending upon whether the witness giving evidence of the conversation was a participant in it or whether the conversation otherwise came to the knowledge of the witness (s.13). In the latter event, the submission would appear to be correct, but in the former event, I agree that the analysis on which Kirby, J. has embarked of the constructions of the section is necessary. 
          
          
         In the event that the evidence is to be led through Ms. Hart, since she was a party to the conversation and the recording was made with her complicity, she may communicate or publish to another person the record of the conversation made by use of the device (s.7(2)(b)). 
          
          
         Evidence may be given by her of the conversation by using the record to revive her memory. Section 13 would not apply and hence s.13(3) in particular would not be applicable. But because matters of illegality or impropriety may arise as a result of her complicity in the recording which was in breach of s.5, questions of discretion under s.138 of the Evidence Act 1995 will need to be considered. 
          
          
         Although the criteria under s.138 are not precisely the same as those under s.13(3), since they speak to a more general position, nonetheless in the particular circumstances the precise application of them would appear to be very much to the same substantive effect as those under s.13(3). 
         
        
       
     14 Section 138 of the Evidence Act is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         138(1) Evidence that was obtained:  
          
         (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or  
          
         (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,  
          
         is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.  
          
         (2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:  
          
         (a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or  
          
         (b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.  
          
         (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:  
          
         (a) the probative value of the evidence, and  
          
         (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and  
          
         (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and  
          
         (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and  
          
         (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and  
          
         (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and  
          
         (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and  
          
         (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.  
         
        
       
     15 As noted above, the trial proceeded in May 2001. The Crown contended that Kinchington DCJ should exercise his discretion under s.138 in favour of the Crown, and either admit the audio and video tapes into evidence through Ms. Hart, or at least allow Ms. Hart to refresh her memory therefrom if necessary in order to give evidence as to the conversations and the events recorded in those tapes. This was opposed by Counsel for the appellant. 
      
       
     16 Kinchington DCJ expressed himself as satisfied that there had been no impropriety or recklessness by persons involved in the use of the listening devices and that any illegality was of a technical nature; and that there would be no unfairness to the appellant in admitting the tapes into evidence. Accordingly, he exercised his discretion under s.138 in favour of the Crown and admitted the tapes into evidence. In those circumstances, he saw no need to rule on the alternative proposition that Ms. Hart refresh her memory from them. 
      
       
     17 The transcript of the appellant’s evidence before the Police Royal Commission on 7 September 1995 and 11 December 1995 was tendered before the jury and admitted over objection. It was agreed between the Crown Prosecutor and Counsel for the appellant that it was not necessary for the Crown to call the court reporters who made the transcript. 
      
       
     18 The video and audio tapes of the conversations on 27 August 1995, 30 August 1995, 7 September 1995 and 12 September 1995 were tendered and admitted on the basis that Ms. Hart was to be called as a witness. They were played while Ms. Hart was in the witness box. 
      
       
     19 The appellant gave evidence at the trial, and was cross-examined by reference both to the material on the video and audio tapes and the transcript before the Police Royal Commission. As noted earlier, he was convicted. 
      
       
        
       GROUND 1: ERROR IN ADMITTING TRANSCRIPTS 
       
     20 It is to be noted that there is no challenge made in this appeal to the primary judge’s exercise of his discretion under s.138 of the Evidence Act, and there is no challenge made to the admission into evidence of the video and audio tapes: the challenge under this ground is only to the admission of the transcript of evidence before the Police Royal Commission.  
      
       
     21 Mr. Game SC for the appellant submitted that parts of the transcripts of evidence before the Police Royal Commission contained quotations of parts of the illegally-recorded conversations, and also statements of the substance of and summaries of such conversations. Accordingly, he submitted, they were evidence of the conversations within s.13(1)(a) of the Act. Furthermore, the conversations in question had come to the knowledge of the Commissioner (Wood CJ at CL), Counsel assisting (Ms. Bell) and the court reporters who recorded the transcript as a result of the use of listening devices in contravention of s.5 of the Act, within the meaning of s.13(1) of the Act. Accordingly, he submitted, all those persons were precluded from giving evidence of the conversations, and that included the production of a record of the conversations (s.12). The transcript of the Police Royal Commission was a record of the conversation, contributed to by Commissioner Wood and Ms. Bell and actually recorded by the court reporters, therefore it could not be given in evidence.  
      
       
     22 Mr. Game submitted that the transcript did not fall within any of the exceptions in s.13(2), apart from s.13(2)(d)(ii). The appellant, being one of the principal parties, did not consent (s.13(2)(a)), and the conversation did not come to the attention of any of these persons otherwise than as a result of the use of listening devices (s.13(2)(b)). On these matters, the onus lay on the Crown which asserted admissibility.  
      
       
     23 Mr. Game conceded that, as regards the second count in the indictment, the case fell within s.13(2)(d)(ii); and did not contend that any exercise of discretion under s.13(3) should go the appellant’s way; but he submitted that the second count was knocked out by the second ground of appeal.  
      
       
     24 Mr. Barrett for the Crown submitted that the relevant transcript, namely that of 11 December 1995, was evidence not of the conversations but of what was said at the Police Royal Commission, this being relevant to prove both the falsity of the appellant’s testimony of 7 September 1995 and also his lack of belief in the truth. Mr. Barrett referred to s.9 of Royal Commission (Police Service) Act 1994 (NSW).  
      
       
     25 He also submitted that, because the Royal Commission evidence was directly a result of information and evidence from Ms. Hart and only partly and indirectly for use of the listening device, it was rendered inadmissible by the Listening Devices Act: see R v. Downey (1992) 66 ACrimR 1.  
      
       
     26 In my opinion, it is important first to note that “private conversation” in s.13(1) means “any words spoken” in the circumstances set out in the definition; so what is being referred to is not the mere fact of the occurrence of a private conversation, or even just the whole or the substance of its contents, but extends to “any words spoken” during the course of the conversation.  
      
       
     27 In so far as the transcript of the Police Royal Commission for 11 December 1995 includes quotations from tapes obtained by use of listening devices, it is in my opinion fanciful to suggest that knowledge of those words by the persons using them (Commissioner Wood and Ms. Bell) or the persons recording them (court reporters) was other than a result, direct or indirect, of the use of the listening devices. It may well be that the fact of the conversations and their general tenor became known to Ms. Bell and Commissioner Wood, at least, through Ms. Hart; but at least the precise quotes used must have come to their knowledge, and through them to the knowledge of the court reporters, through the use of the listening device. Although it is not quite so clear, in my opinion, the same must apply to those questions which used the substance of parts of the conversations rather than exact words.  
      
       
     28 I accept the submission of Mr. Game that the appellant should not be disadvantaged because he did not insist that the court reporters be called at the trial, so if the evidence notionally given by the court reporters through the transcript is “evidence of the conversation” within s.13(1) of the Act, the giving of such evidence would be prohibited. The question thus is, is such evidence, namely the evidence of the court reporters through the transcript, “evidence of the conversation”, that is, evidence of “words spoken” in the conversation. 
      
       
     29 In my opinion, in so far as the court reporters through the transcripts gave evidence of questions asked by Ms. Bell or Commissioner Wood in which words were quoted or the substance of parts of the conversation given, this is only evidence of questions asked and cannot be evidence of the conversation or of words spoken in them.  
      
       
     30 In so far as the court reporters gave evidence of answers by the appellant (which had to be understood by reference to the questions), this could amount to indirect evidence of the conversations and the words spoken in it, by way of admissions by the appellant. However, the question whether this material was therefore “evidence of the conversation” within s.13(1) must be considered in the light of the following two matters: 
      
       
       (1) The recordings themselves were already in evidence, and there was no suggestion that those recordings were otherwise than accurate or that there was any doubt about their authenticity. 
        
       (2) The substantial relevance of the transcript was not that it conveyed some of the contents of the conversations, but that it conveyed the appellant’s evidence concerning such matters.  
        
       
     31 If the recordings themselves had not been in evidence, and if the Crown had relied to any extent at all on the appellant’s admissions in order to prove the content of the conversations, I think the court reporters’ evidence of admissions by the appellant could be “evidence of the conversation” within s.13(1). However, in circumstances where there was absolutely no issue about the authenticity and accuracy of the recordings themselves which were in evidence, where the Crown did not rely at all on the appellant’s admissions to prove the content of the conversations, and where the transcript was led for a different purpose, the recordings were not in substance “evidence of the conversation”. Accordingly, in my opinion, this ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
     32 I note that these reasons depend to some extent on the circumstance that the recordings themselves were in evidence: as noted, that was not challenged below, except on the s.138 basis, or here. However, I should record that in my opinion there is another question which would, if the point were taken, need to be considered before a recording derived from illegal use of a listening device is admitted into evidence through one of the participants in the conversation. The only way the participant can lay the foundation for the admission of the recording is to say that he or she has listened to it and that it constitutes an accurate record of the conversation. However, the giving of evidence to that effect would in my view involve a response to a leading question, giving rise to the matters dealt with in s.37 of the Evidence Act.  
      
       
     33 “Leading question” is defined in the dictionary of the Evidence Act as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""leading question"" means a question asked of a witness that:  
          
         (a) directly or indirectly suggests a particular answer to the question, or  
          
         (b) assumes the existence of a fact the existence of which is in dispute in the proceeding and as to the existence of which the witness has not given evidence before the question is asked.  
         
        
       
     34 However identification of a recording of a conversation is raised with a witness who had no part in making the recording but did take part in the conversation, what in substance is being done is to have the witness assent to the conversation having occurred precisely as recorded; so inevitably a particular answer is suggested. The witness is not being asked what was said or even asked whether the conversation was in general terms to a certain effect; but rather, whether the very words recorded were in fact spoken. Accordingly, if objection were taken (s.37(1)(c)), then generally leave under s.37(1)(a) would be required, requiring consideration of the matters referred to in s.192 of the Evidence Act. The same discretionary considerations as supported the decision under s.138 may well have justified the giving of leave under ss.37 and 192 in this case; but it is my opinion a separate question. 
      
       
     35 As suggested in the earlier Court of Appeal decision, a participant could give evidence of the conversation using the record to revive memory. However, if this was to be done in court, leave would be required under s.32 of the Evidence Act, again bringing s.192 into play. 
      
       
        
       INCITING SUPPLY 
       
     36 At the hearing of the appeal, Mr. Game for the appellant sought leave to rely on an additional ground of appeal in relation to the second count, namely:  
      
       
        
         
         The trial judge failed to direct the jury adequately in relation to the second count in the indictment. 
         
        
       
     37 In order to deal with the original ground relied on concerning this count and also the additional ground, it is necessary to set out some circumstances.  
      
       
     38 On 28 October 1998, the appellant’s solicitors wrote a letter to the DPP requesting particulars of the charges, including the following particulars in relation to the second charge: 
      
       
        
         
         The Hart matter: 
          
         (a) On which day or days is it alleged that the accused incited Ms. Hart to supply a prohibited drug. 
          
         (b) To whom is it alleged the accused incited Ms. Hart to supply the said drug. 
          
         (c) What drug is it alleged the accused incited Ms. Hart to supply. 
          
         (d) What quantities of the specified drugs is it alleged the accused incited Ms. Hart to supply. 
          
         (e) Where the drugs in fact supplied. 
          
         (f) How is it alleged Ms. Hart purchased the drugs allegedly supplied. 
          
         (f) What statements and which parts of those statements of Therese Hart does the Director rely upon to establish the incitement. 
          
         (g) Has Ms. Hart made any other statements relevant to this matter to either police, Royal Commission investigators or the Royal Commission. Please supply copies of any such statements. 
          
         (h) In addition to those portion (sic) of Ms. Hart’s statements what other evidence does the Crown seek to rely upon to establish the offence. 
         
        
       
     39 By letter dated 23 November 1998, the DPP replied, and the relevant parts of the letter were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         In relation to your request for particulars please be advised that the documentary material contained in the brief together with informations disclose the particulars of the matter and the evidence relied upon by the prosecution in support of the charges. 
          
          
         Without limiting the generality of the above, particulars are set out for your assistance. These particulars are set out to assist your understanding of the case the Prosecution will present at committal. 
          
          
         The Prosecution is not bound by the following particulars which do not purport to be a statement of the evidence which the Prosecution will present at committal. 
          
          
         The right is reserved to delete, add to vary or amend any particulars to the extent that such deletion, addition, variation or amendment may appear necessary or desirable in light of the evidence given at committal hearing, or further information which may come to the notice of the Prosecution. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         In relation to the matter that you refer to as the “Hart matter” I confirm that your client has been charged with one count of Incite the Supply of a Prohibited Drug pursuant to s25/s27 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and one count of Give False Testimony pursuant to the Royal Commission Act. 
          
          
         In relation to the Supply charge the Crown can indicate the following particulars in response to your request: 
          
          
         a) It is alleged that Eade incited GDU 7 to supply a prohibited drug on 12 September 1995. 
          
         b) It is alleged that Eade incited GDU 7 Hart to supply the said drug to Steve McClelland. 
          
         c) It is alleged that Eade incited GDU 7 to supply ecstasy tablets. 
          
         d) Unknown. 
          
         e) Unknown. 
          
         f1) Unknown. 
          
         f2) The Crown relies on the brief of evidence as served on you by the PIC with particular reference to the following material: 
         
        
       
     · The statement of GDU 7 dated 29/10/1966, particularly paragraph 12.· The Record of Interview between Taggart and GDU 7 dated 13/9/1995.· The Record of Interview between Taggart and GDU 7 on 29/10/1996 particularly page 7 and 8. 
      
       
        
         
         g) GDU 7 participated in 25 Record of Interviews with officers from the Royal Commission that relate to her ongoing relationship with Eade and the drugs she obtained for him. I am advised that these Interviews comprise Volume 3 of the Brief of Evidence served on you on 25 June 1998. 
          
         h) In addition to the evidence of GDU 7 the Crown seeks to rely upon the following evidence: 
         
        
       
     · The Surveillance tape no. 41 (video and audio) dated 12/9/1995. 
      
       
     40 On 18 April 2001, the appellant’s solicitors wrote a further letter to the DPP on this matter, which included the following: 
      
       
        
         
         I refer to my letter dated 28 October 1998 by which I requested particulars to the charges that my client was then facing. I also refer to your letter dated 23 November 1998 supplying the particulars sought. 
          
          
         Although the Director's letter states that the prosecution is not ""bound"" by the particulars provided , I assume that in the absence of advice to the contrary, those particulars have not changed in any material way (apart from the no-billed Scott matter), whether by addition, amendment, variation or deletion. If that assumption is not correct, please advise me of any such addition, amendment, variation or deletion to 'the particulars supplied as a matter of urgency. As the trial is set down for 7 May 2001, please furnish any such advice by or before Monday 23 April 2001 in order that my client's case for trial may be properly prepared. 
         
        
       
     41 In its reply dated 26 April 2001, the DPP relevantly stated: 
      
       
        
         
         The facts on which the crown intends to rely have not changed in any material way. The indictment has not been changed. 
         
        
       
     42 It will be noted that in its letter of 23 November 1998, the DPP signified intention to rely on the surveillance tape dated 12 September 1995, and that tape set out the actual conversation which the Crown alleged amounted to the offence of inciting to supply. That tape includes a statement by the appellant “Steve wants some eccies”; a statement by Ms. Hart “Well, which is more important, your coke or Steve’s eccies?”; a statement by the appellant “Well how long is it to get the eccies?”; and a statement by Ms. Hart “Well, the eccies are gonna have to wait because it means if, if Steve’s not gonna give me some money for M I’m gonna have to do … roll something over for Kim’s brother, like I did for Con”. 
      
       
     43 In cross-examination, Ms. Hart agreed that there was no suggestion that she would give the drugs to Steve herself; and agreed that for all she knew, the appellant could have simply been seeking information under the pretext of obtaining a supply of ecstasy.  
      
       
     44 The trial judge agreed that the effect of the evidence of Ms. Hart was that the appellant had asked her to supply him with ecstasy, and that he had said he would pass it on to somebody else.  
      
       
     45 In summing up to the jury, the trial judge explained the meaning of the charge by saying “By ‘incited’ it is meant to urge somebody to do something”. He also gave the following directions: 
      
       
        
         
         As to the second charge which relates to 12 September 1995, I identified the essential elements in regard to that charge that the Crown must prove as being that on 12 September 1995 the accused incited the witness named Unwin to supply a prohibited drug, namely Ecstasy, to him. I then went on to deal with those essential elements. 
          
          
         So far as that second charge is concerned, before you can return a verdict of guilty on it not only must you be satisfied that the accused incited the person Unwin to supply the prohibited drug Ecstasy, but it is implicit in you so concluding and necessary for you to be satisfied from the accused's words and actions at that time that he intended Miss Unwin to procure the prohibited drug Ecstasy by those words. 
          
          
         ... 
          
          
         As to the second count the Crown says, well that emanates from the conversation that took place on 12 September and is shown on the video tape exhibit ""G"". The Crown says that that evidence is clear, that there is a conversation, that he is urging, and intentionally urging Miss Unwin to obtain some eccie tablets for him under the pretext of getting them and passing them on to Steve McClelland an officer in the Police Force. 
         
        
       
     46 Mr Game submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant incited Ms. Hart to supply drugs to Steve, and that accordingly, that being the only offence particularised, there should have been a directed verdict in favour of the appellant.  
      
       
     47 He further submitted that the primary judge, having refused a directed verdict, permitted the Crown to address on the basis that the appellant was urging Ms. Hart to obtain ecstasy tablets for him under the pretext that he would pass them on to Steve; and thus that the Crown had been permitted to change its case after the close of evidence. Furthermore, Mr. Game submitted that a request by A to B to supply a drug to A cannot amount to inciting: otherwise, every time an addict requested a drug from a supplier, this would amount to the serious offence of inciting supply, and not the much less serious offence of possession.  
      
       
     48 Mr. Game submitted that, in his summing up, the trial judge did not put the case on the basis particularised by the Crown, or even as it was outlined during the hearing, that it was a matter of on-supply. Rather the trial judge put the case on the basis that the offence consisted of the appellant inciting the Ms. Hart to supply the drugs to him.  
      
       
     49 In my opinion, the identification of the person to whom the incited supply is to be made is not an element in the offence. A person accused of the offence of inciting is entitled to particulars, and there could be unfairness possibly amounting to a miscarriage of justice if the Crown case departed from particulars that had been given. In this case however, although the particulars identified Steve as the person to whom Ms. Hart was incited to supply drugs, the transcript of the conversation alleged to amount to the incitement was also supplied. The question whether this conversation amounted to an incitement to supply to Steve or to the appellant for on-supply to Steve, or whether the mention of Steve was merely a pretext, were matters of interpretation of the basic facts which were supplied to the appellant.  
      
       
     50 In those circumstances, in my opinion there was no unfair departure by the prosecution from the particulars it had supplied.  
      
       
     51 I agree with Mr. Game’s submission that a mere request by an addict to the addict’s supplier for drugs would not normally amount to the offence of inciting; but in my opinion that is not because the requested supply is to the person asking, but rather because in the normal case the element of incitement is absent. The element of incitement is generally absent in such cases because the drugs are being acquired from a person understood by the acquirer to be ready, willing and able to supply drugs forthwith to the acquirer; and incitement does not occur because it is not required. 
      
       
     52 One would expect incitement to occur only in those cases when a person is seeking a supply of drugs from another person not understood by the former to be ready, willing and able forthwith to supply the drugs as sought. It is in those cases that the extra element of incitement might occur, so as to bring it about that the other person is induced to become ready, willing and able to make the supply. 
      
       
     53 In Castle v. Olen (1985) 3 NSWLR 26, Yeldham J was dealing with an alleged offence of supplying a drug of addiction within an extended definition of “supply” which included “causing … exposure for sale”. At p.30, his Honour said this: 
      
       
        
         
         I am satisfied that more is required to constitute a “causing” than a mere request to a friend to obtain and sell to the person charged a prohibited drug. Certainly the evidence supports the view that the plaintiff sought from Pearce a supply to him for his own use. If the plaintiff had some authority over Pearce or was able to exert some pressure upon him to require him to procure the drug, then it would have been necessary to determine whether the fact that it was to be sold to the plaintiff for use by him and not for re-sale would, as counsel for the plaintiff submitted, affect the situation. In this respect the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Coles [1984] 1 NSWLR 726 at 733-734, would be no doubt of relevance. I say nothing about that matter and leave it for determination when and if it later arises for consideration.  
         
        
       
     54 I see no reason why, if a person urges another person to go and obtain drugs so that the drugs may be supplied to the person doing the urging, that cannot amount to incitement to supply. 
      
       
     55 In the present case, there is no suggestion that Ms. Hart was holding herself out to the appellant as ready, willing and able forthwith to supply ecstasy to him, or that the appellant believed she was ready, willing and able to do this, so that all that would be required, in the appellant’s understanding, was a simple request. In circumstances where no such suggestion was being made, in my opinion there was no need to do more than the trial judge did to explain the offence, namely to draw the jury’s attention to the meaning of incite, and direct the jury that this is what had to be found beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant. 
      
       
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     56 For those reasons, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     57 HIDDEN J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
      
       
     58 SMART AJ: The facts and circumstances are set out in the reasons of Hodgson JA with which I am in agreement. I add the following comments. 
      
       
     59 In Young v Cassells (1914) 33 NZLR 852 Stout CJ, in an oft quoted passage said: ""The word 'incite' means to rouse; to stimulate; to urge or spur on; to stir up; to animate."" In R v Massie (1998) 103 A Crim R 551 at 564 Brooking JA, with whom Winneke P and Batt JA agreed, said of 'incite', ""common forms of behaviour covered by the word are 'command', 'request', 'propose', 'advise', 'encourage', or 'authorise'"". Whether in a particular case what was said amounts to incitement depends upon the context in which the words were used, and the circumstances. 
      
       
     60 It was pointed out in Regina v Asst Recorder of Kingston [1969] 2 QB 58 at 62 that with the offence of incitement it is merely the incitement which constitutes the offence and that it matters not that no steps have been taken towards the commission of the substantive offence nor whether the incitement had any effect at all. In the present case the applicant urged Ms Hart to supply prohibited drugs. 
      
       
     61 I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA.

       Facts 
        
        
       The appellant, Mr Dettmer, was a sub-contractor to the first respondent, K J McCracken (McCracken), which in turn was performing building and maintenance works for the second respondent, The State of New South Wales. The sub-contract works included the removal and replacement of a number of damaged awnings at Merrylands High School. In the course of carrying out the building works, the appellant fell from one of the awnings and injured himself. 
        
        
       The appellant sued the first and second respondents in negligence for damages for the injuries he suffered. The State was sued in two capacities as occupier of the school site, through the Department of Education and also the Department of Public Works, which let and supervised the head contract with McCracken. 
        
        
       At the trial the appellant argued that McCracken owed him a duty of care notwithstanding that he was a subcontractor of McCracken. However, Judge Ainslie-Wallace found that the evidence fell far short of establishing the required elements of control as indicated in  
       Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Limited  
       (1985 – 1986) 160 CLR 16. Her Honour also found that no special relationship between the parties, such as would lead McCracken to owe a non-delegable duty of care to the appellant, was established. Further, the trial judge rejected the submission that McCracken ought to have known that the awning was unsafe and had a duty to warn the appellant. 
        
        
       On the issue of liability of the second respondent, as occupier of the site, her Honour found that it was a reasonable inference on the evidence that the second respondent ought to have known of the defective state of the awning. However, the judge concluded that the knowledge of the second respondent was insufficient to give rise to a duty to warn the appellant that the work it had engaged McCracken to do, and through it, the appellant, would cause the structure to become unstable. 
        
        
       On appeal 
        
        
       It is submitted by the appellant that her Honour was in error in finding that no special duty of care was owed by the first respondent to the appellant notwithstanding that he was a subcontractor. The appellant submits that McCracken held a position of authority and control over him and that he relied on the expertise and skill of McCracken to ascertain the safety of the awning. 
        
        
       The appellant makes a similar submission with respect to the second respondent, in particular, it was submitted that a proper examination of the awning would have revealed that it was unsound and unsafe. 
        
        
       Held  
       (per Stein JA, Meagher JA and Campbell AJA agreeing) 
        
        
       1) Officers of the first respondent did not direct the appellant in any material way as to how he was to carry out the works the subject of the subcontract. Rather, the first respondent relied on the skill, experience and knowledge of the appellant to carry out the building works and assess the structural adequacy of the awning in question. 
        
        
       2) The second respondent had no part in instructing or directing the appellant as to how he should carry out the subcontract with McCracken. The system of work which the appellant adopted was completely a matter for him and it was the appellant who devised the system of work which he would follow in order to carry out his subcontract. 
        
        
       3) The trial judge was entitled to find on the evidence that the second respondent had insufficient knowledge to cause it to know that the removal of the roofing sheets, in the manner determined by the appellant, would cause the awning to become unstable. 
        
        
       4) The principles in  
       Stevens v Brodribb  
       can be distinguished in this case. It does not concern a situation where the appellant was engaged in a business being conducted by another party, nor did the accident occur because of the interdependence of two or more trades or work skills and the absence of any system to regulate that interdependence. 
        
        
       5) The contractor did not owe a duty of care to his subcontractor to devise a safe system of work for the subcontractor to carry out the work the subject of the subcontract or to relevantly warn the appellant.

       Introduction 
        
       
     3 The appellant, Douglas Ronald Dettmer, appeals from a judgment of Judge Ainslie-Wallace delivered in the District Court on 11 May 2001. Her Honour entered a verdict for the defendants, K J McCracken Pty Limited and the State of New South Wales, the respondents to the appeal. The appellant had sued for damages for injuries he suffered when he fell from an awning while undertaking building work at Merrylands High School on 10 February 1993. The appellant was a sub-contractor to the first respondent (McCracken) which in turn was performing building and maintenance works at the school for the second respondent, the State of New South Wales. The State was sued in two capacities as occupier of the school site, through the Department of Education and also the Department of Public Works, which let and supervised the head contract with McCracken. 
      
       
     4 On the first day of the hearing in the District Court on 17 October 2000 it appears that the first respondent was placed in liquidation, however leave was given to the liquidator to defend the proceedings. The company was apparently insured with HIH. No appearance was filed by the first respondent in the Court of Appeal and there was no appearance on its behalf at the hearing of the appeal. 
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
     5 Her Honour carefully found the relevant facts and what follows draws upon her findings. The appellant was a roof plumber in partnership with his wife since 1975. The partnership employed the appellant’s sons in the business. Mr Dettmer testified that his work involved installing roof plumbing and fixing roof sheeting, principally on large building sites. Occasionally, this would involve the demolition of roofs. The appellant said that he was a pioneer in the field of roof plumbing and, by dint of his efforts, apprenticeships in the trade were commenced. The first respondent was a firm of builders and contractors who had used the appellant as a sub-contractor for many years. 
      
       
     6 The Department of Public Works commissioned McCracken to carry out work on the repair and maintenance of the Merrylands High School. In December 1992 the appellant was asked by McCracken to quote for some roofing works at the school. The works were part of the first respondent’s contract with the second respondent. The sub-contract works included the removal of a number of awnings in the school grounds. One of the awnings was attached to the school canteen, which abutted the playground. Most of the roofing sheets on the canteen awning were rusted or otherwise damaged. The appellant’s quotation was to include the removal and replacement of the damaged roof sheeting and guttering to the awning. 
      
       
     7 Prior to quoting for the job the appellant inspected the site and the awnings. The appellant submitted a quotation in the sum of $13,796 which, by letter dated 18 January 1993, was accepted by McCracken. The acceptance letter nominated Mr Don Pillay as its site representative and made reference to the ‘subcontract conditions’ which were available from the site representative. The letter annexed a document describing the relevant sub-contract conditions. This included clauses providing for the contract payment to be by way of a lump sum and for insurance to be taken out by the subcontractor. Working days and hours were specified. Liquidated damages were provided for, as was a defects liability period. 
      
       
     8 Besides Mr Pillay, the first respondent nominated a Mr Robinson as the site manager. Before quoting for the job the appellant had met Mr Robinson on site and had a discussion with him, which it seems was of a fairly general nature. While on site the appellant looked at what was required in a general way to obtain an idea of the scope of the work. He returned to the site later in January 1993 and measured the canteen awning so that he could quote a price for the job. In doing the measuring he stood beneath the awning. 
      
       
     9 The work the subject of the subcontract commenced at the beginning of February 1993. Her Honour described the progress of the work on the canteen awning as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         The plaintiff commenced work on the roof by removing the gutter from along the outside edge of the awning. The plaintiff was assisted in the work by his son. The gutter was dismantled by first removing the bolts from the outside edge of the gutter which connected the gutter to the roof. This was done by the plaintiff’s son who, according to the plaintiff, placed a ladder on the ground and leaned it against the roof. 
         
        
        
         
         When the gutter was removed, the plaintiff said that he observed that the edge beam at the playground side of the awning was not a continuous beam running the length of the awning. Instead, the gutter was bolted onto a series of pieces of angle iron which were apparently held together by the guttering. The plaintiff said that when the gutter was removed the front edge of the awning dropped slightly and it was then that he realised that the edge was not a continuous piece of iron. After seeing this, the plaintiff had one of his sons weld the pieces of angle iron together to form a continuous piece.  
          
         
        
       
     10 A few days later Mr Robinson telephoned the appellant and told him that an overnight storm had caused problems with the awning on the playground side to the extent that the southern end had partly collapsed. It appears that Mr Robinson had caused an adjustable prop to be placed under that end to give it support. The appellant attended the site the next day and noted the prop. He also observed that the rafter beam at the southern end was not attached to the edge beam. The appellant formed the view that the gutter, which had run along the edge of the awning and which he had removed, had been holding the sides of the awning together. 
      
       
     11 The appellant discussed the matter with Mr Robinson and suggested that the awning be welded with some angle iron. It seems that Mr Robinson acquiesced in the suggestion and this work was performed by one of the sons of the appellant. Her Honour found that the appellant had the discussion with Mr Robinson in part to ensure that he could claim payment for the welding. 
      
       
     12 Importantly, her Honour said that, contrary to the appellant’s evidence, she was not satisfied that he was directed by Mr Robinson to undertake any welding, although Robinson had clearly agreed to the welding being done.  
      
       
     13 The trial judge continued: 
      
       
        
         
         The plaintiff’s evidence was clear that when he saw that the edge beam was not a continuous piece of metal and, similarly, that the corners were not welded, he formed the view that those problems must be rectified before he did any further work and before he got onto the roof of the awning. It was his view that having done the welding described, the faults had been rectified.  
         
        
       
     14 Her Honour observed that there was no dispute on the evidence that the manner in which the awning had been constructed many years before, meant that the roof sheets were all that gave it lateral support. When they were removed the structure was significantly destabilised. It was also not disputed, by reason of reports obtained subsequent to the appellant’s accident, that the awning was badly designed and poorly constructed. 15 The appellant’s accident happened as follows. Before Mr Dettmer started to remove the roof sheets on the day of his fall, he had his son remove the rivets from the roof sheeting closest to the edge of the playground. The appellant then commenced his work by removing the rivets from the roof sheets closest to the canteen side. To do this, he stood on the roof sheet next to the one from which he was removing the rivets. After having removed the rivets from that edge, he removed the ‘tek’ screw in the centre of the roof sheet. He then removed the sheet and moved to the next sheet and repeated the process. At some stage he would pass the removed sheets to the ground for removal from the site. 
      
       
     16 At the time of his fall the appellant had removed at least 90% of the sheets. Mr Pillay and Mr Robinson approached the appellant and started to speak to him. Because the appellant was hard of hearing he decided to climb down off the awning. He turned and put his foot on the tek screw line in the centre of the sheet, felt something move beneath him and fell 3 metres to the ground. He was quite seriously injured. 
      
       
     17 While he was lying on his back on the concrete beneath the awning, he looked up and saw that a bolt was missing, which should have been fastened to the middle beam. The middle beam was twisted out of shape. The missing bolt and twisted beam were directly above where the plaintiff was lying and where he had been working prior to the fall. 
      
       
     18 In addition to lay evidence, the judge received three expert engineering reports. Her Honour concluded that she was satisfied that it was the twisting of the rafter beam which caused the appellant to fall, not that he had stepped onto an unsecured roof sheet. However, since the roof sheets provided the only lateral support, when they were removed from the awning, there was a sideways movement and rotation of the middle beam. The experts agreed that had the middle beam been securely fastened at each end, it would not have twisted. While one expert opined that the missing bolt was a major factor, he accepted that it was the removal of the sheets which allowed the twisting movement to occur.19 No scaffolding was erected around the awning. The appellant’s evidence was that the site of the awning was not amenable to the use of a scaffold. The appellant did not use a safety harness when he worked on the awning nor did he erect a safety rail around the edge.  
      
       
     20 The appellant’s evidence was that he removed the roof sheets in the only way which he believed it could be done. He indicated that it was necessary for him to stand on the awning roof to remove the rivets and to be able to hold the drill directly above the rivet. No one told the appellant how he was to carry out the task of removing the roofing sheets, least of all any representative of McCracken, or for that matter the second respondent. 
      
       
        
       Judgment at first instance 
        
       
     21 At the trial the appellant argued that McCracken owed him a duty of care notwithstanding that he was a subcontractor of McCracken. The trial judge however found that the evidence fell far short of establishing the elements of control or other factors indicated by Mason J, as he then was, in Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Limited (1985 – 1986) 160 CLR 16 at 24. Her Honour also found that there was not established any special relationship between the parties such as would lead to McCracken owing a non-delegable duty of care to the appellant (Kondis v State Transport Authority (1983 – 1984) 156 CLR 672).  
      
       
     22 Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         In my view the evidence does not establish the requisite degree of control and vulnerability in the circumstances of this case to give rise to a special duty of care.  
         
        
       
     23 The trial judge also rejected the submission that McCracken ought to have known that the awning was unsafe and had a duty to warn the appellant. Her Honour found that such knowledge as the first respondent had was insufficient to put it on notice ‘any more than it alerted the plaintiff’. She added that the first respondent did not have any greater qualification or expertise than the appellant. 
      
       
     24 Turning to the issue of liability of the second respondent her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         It is a reasonable inference on all of the evidence that the second defendant knew that the roof of the awning consisted of sheets which were rusted and/or damaged and that 90-95% of them would need to be replaced. The second defendant must have made an inspection of the awning in order to establish the work which was to be done in the scope of the work. Mr Blood was apparently the employee of the second defendant who was charged with the responsibility of seeing that the scope of works was followed and was in charge of seeing to matters of site safety.  
         
        
       
     25 The evidence led her Honour to find that the second respondent, as occupier of the site, ought to have known of the defective state of the awning. 
      
       
     26 However, the question arose of whether it knew, or that it ought to have known, that the work which it engaged McCracken to do, and through it, the appellant, would cause the structure to become unstable. If it did, it had a duty to warn the appellant, either directly or indirectly through the first respondent. 
      
       
     27 The judge concluded that: 
      
       
        
         
         The knowledge of the second defendant as I have found it is, in my view, insufficient to cause it to have known that the removal of the roof sheets would cause the awning to become unstable.  
         
        
        
       The appellant’s case 
        
       
     28 As to the liability of McCracken, the appellant submits that the evidence establishes its position of authority and control over the appellant. Accordingly, it is submitted that her Honour was in error in finding that no special duty of care was owed by the first respondent to the appellant notwithstanding that he was a subcontractor. Further, the appellant was in a position of special dependence and vulnerability and accordingly relied on the first respondent. The appellant, so it was submitted, had no knowledge or skill to comprehend that the awning was dangerous for him to walk upon in the manner that he did. He therefore relied on the expertise and skill of McCracken to examine the awning in order to ascertain that it was safe for the respondent to work upon.  
      
       
     29 The appellant sought to buttress his argument by reference to the activities of McCracken in giving him directions on the work he was required by it to do. It was further submitted that her Honour erred in not finding that, in response to the risk, it would have been reasonable for the first respondent to warn the appellant of the danger, when it knew, or ought to have known, that the awning was unsafe. 
      
       
     30 A similar submission is made by the appellant with respect to the second respondent. Particular reliance was placed upon the evidence that the awning was poorly designed and constructed and upon her Honour’s finding that the second respondent must have inspected it in order to establish what work needed to be done within the scope of works contracted to the first respondent.  
      
       
     31 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that a proper examination of the awning would have revealed that it was unsound and unsafe. 
      
       
        
       The liability of the State of New South Wales 
        
       
     32 I turn firstly to the question of the liability of the second respondent. It must be remembered that the second respondent had no direct relationship with the appellant. The Department of Public Works let a contract for the performance of works at the school to the first respondent. One of the subcontractors of the first respondent was the appellant. The second respondent had no part in instructing or directing the appellant as to how he should carry out the subcontract with McCracken. The system of work which the appellant adopted was completely a matter for him. That is in accordance with the evidence, including that of the appellant himself. 
      
       
     33 The appellant, a roof plumber of considerable relevant experience, had the benefit of inspections of the awning before he carried out the work. While it seems that he was more intent on measuring up for the purposes of tendering for the job, the appellant was beneath the awning and inspected the underside of the sheeting and structure of the awning. He was in a position to see the missing bolt and the apparent nature of the construction. Indeed, it seems that the appellant did appreciate that the awning had structural problems since he suggested to Mr Robinson, which was accepted by him, that he weld angle irons in the corners. Moreover, he saw the result of the storm damage which led to a partial collapse of the southern end of the awning and the need for the first respondent to place an adjustable prop under that end to support it. 
      
       
     34 The evidence is plain that the appellant determined, without any input from anyone else, how he was going to carry out the removal of the roof sheeting. 
      
       
     35 It was the appellant who devised the system of work which he would follow in order to carry out his subcontract. The intervention of Mr Peter Blood from the Department of Public Works, who was charged with responsibility for the scope of works, is relied on by the appellant to establish the authority and direction of the second respondent to the appellant. However, Mr Blood did no more than tell the appellant to remove and replace all of the roof sheets rather than only those which were rusted or damaged. In reality this made little difference since it appears that the scope of works, and the subcontract, required between 90 and 95% of the roof sheets to be removed and replaced. At the time the appellant fell and injured himself, he had, according to his evidence, already removed in excess of 90%. 
      
       
     36 The limited intervention of Mr Blood did nothing to change the relationship between the appellant and the second respondent so as to create a duty of care in the latter owed to the appellant. 
      
       
     37 In my opinion her Honour was entitled to find that the appellant’s injury would have occurred whether or not Mr Blood had directed the appellant to remove all of the roofing sheets. 
      
       
     38 What is centrally important to the facts is that it was the roof sheets which gave the awning lateral support. Without the roofing sheets, the structure became unsafe. As each sheet was removed, the awning became progressively more unstable. The bolt from the middle beam, under the sheet on which the appellant had been working immediately before he fell, was missing where it joined the rafter beam. Her Honour was entitled to find that it was the loss of lateral support in the awning, by reason of the appellant’s removal of the roof sheets which, together with the missing bolt, permitted the beam to twist and caused the appellant to fall to the ground. 
      
       
     39 While her Honour found that the second respondent, as occupier, ought to have known that the awning was defective, she was correct to then consider whether the second respondent knew, or ought to have known, that the work on the awning which it engaged McCracken to carry out, and which the first respondent subcontracted to the appellant, would cause the structure to become unstable. If it did, it had a duty to warn the contractor. However, in my opinion, her Honour was entitled to find on the evidence that the second respondent had insufficient knowledge to cause it to know that the removal of the roofing sheets, in the manner determined by the appellant, would cause the awning to become unstable. 
      
       
     40 It seems to me tolerably clear on the evidence that the reason that the unfortunate accident occurred arose from the system of work adopted by the appellant himself.  
      
       
     41 The appellant’s system of work was something that the second respondent had no role in. It was purely a matter for the appellant to determine how he would carry out his subcontract. 
      
       
     42 The removal of the roofing sheets by the appellant progressively rendered the awning less stable. While the awning was defective at the time of the events, it was not rendered ‘dangerous’ until the appellant removed its only lateral support. It was for the subcontractor to formulate a safe system for him and his sons to carry out the work. The existence of the risk, that the awning would collapse if the roof sheets were removed in the manner formulated by the appellant, was not a risk that the second respondent was aware. The evidence was certainly insufficient, as her Honour found, to establish this knowledge. The second respondent was dealing with an experienced contractor (the first respondent) who in turn had subcontracted to a very experienced and specialist roof plumber, bearing in mind the scope of the works. 
      
       
     43 On behalf of the second respondent, Mr Graves SC submits that even if the second respondent was aware of the potential risk, it had no liability since it was for the appellant (and perhaps the first respondent) to devise a suitable system of work to cope with the risk. In the circumstances of the facts of this case, it seems to me that the submission is correct. 
      
       
     44 In my opinion her Honour was not in error in finding that the second respondent was not liable to the appellant in negligence. 
      
       
        
       The Liability of McCracken 
        
       
     45 Much of what I have said above is equally applicable to the question of the liability of the first respondent. Nonetheless, a different factual basis underlay the appellant’s case against McCracken.  
      
       
     46 In particular, the role played by Mr Robinson and Mr Pillay, employees of the first respondent, was stressed as material by Mr Blacket SC on behalf of the appellant. Mr Robinson was the site supervisor in charge of the scope of works under the first respondent’s contract with the Department of Public Works. The appellant maintained that at various points of time he was subject to the directions of Mr Robinson. In addition, the appellant contended that he relied on the expertise of the first respondent. The appellant had no engineering background whereas the first respondent was described on its letterhead as ‘builders and structural engineers’. The appellant claimed that McCracken had engineering experience. 
      
       
     47 A fair reading of the evidence leads to the conclusion that the first respondent never gave the appellant any directions as to how he was to carry out the works the subject of the subcontract. The idea of the welding of the awning with angle irons emanated from the appellant who volunteered to have his son carry it out, so long as he was paid for it. There was no direction by the first respondent to the appellant to carry out the welding in the sense necessary to support the appellant’s submission. Indeed, there was no evidence of any direction to the appellant as to how he was to carry out the work. At the highest Mr Pillay suggested that before the work was performed he or Mr Robinson might ask the appellant to give him an idea as to how he was going to carry out the works the subject of the subcontract. As her Honour observed, it was the unchallenged evidence of Mr Pillay that he was told by his employer that the appellant was an experienced tradesperson and he was ‘to leave him alone’. 
      
       
     48 The other aspect of the evidence is the relative skill, experience and knowledge of the appellant on the one hand and that of the first respondent, in particular Mr Pillay and Mr Robinson, on the other. As her Honour observed neither of these men had any engineering qualifications. Indeed, so far as the evidence discloses, they were carpenters. Her Honour found that they had no particular qualifications to assess the structural adequacy of the awning in question. Although Mr Pillay thought the awning was ‘flimsy’ he did not realise its deficiency in design until after the accident.49 By contrast the appellant had 25 years experience as a specialist roof plumber and for many years had carried out similar work on contracts with the first respondent. He had the benefit of at least two inspections. While he was clearly more concerned with measuring the awning for the purposes of the tender, he had the opportunity of inspecting the structure of the awning and the roof sheeting. In particular, he did this, in part, from underneath the awning. Indeed, his inspections did indicate some of the deficiencies in the structure. Hence, the welding of the angle irons at his suggestion.  
      
       
     50 Moreover, as mentioned before, he provided his own workmen, his tools and devised his own system of work. In this the appellant was not directed in any material way by officers of the first respondent. Indeed, to the contrary. It seems to me that the appellant had more relevant expertise than either Mr Pillay or Mr Robinson and her Honour was right to so find. 
      
       
     51 In his evidence the appellant, perhaps understandably, sought to shift responsibility to the first respondent contending that it would not ask him to work on the structure unless it had ascertained that it was safe for him to do so. Her Honour described some of the appellant’s evidence in this regard as ‘disingenuous’. She said that ‘it is not credible that [the appellant] would not make any independent assessment of whether or not a structure was unsafe but rather, to rely on the opinion of the contractor who engaged him’.  
      
       
     52 In so far as the appellant places reliance upon Stevens v Brodribb, it should be noted that this case does not concern a situation where the appellant was engaged in a business being conducted by another party, nor did the accident occur because of the interdependence of two or more trades or work skills and the absence of any system to regulate that interdependence. See Mason J at 31 and also McArdle v Andmac Roofing Co [1967] 1 WLR 356. 
      
       
     53 In my opinion this is not a case where the contractor owed a duty of care to his subcontractor to devise a safe system of work for the subcontractor to carry out the work the subject of the subcontract or to relevantly warn the appellant. 
      
       
     54 The trial judge was correct to find that the first respondent was not liable to the appellant. 
      
       
     55 Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

     3 CARRUTHERS AJ: SMR appeals against his conviction on 16 October 2000 at the Griffith District Court on five sexual offences.  
      
       
     4 The appellant was arraigned before her Honour Judge Latham and a jury of twelve at the Griffith District Court on 12 October 2000 upon an indictment which contained five counts. The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count and on 16 October the jury returned verdicts of guilty on each count. 
      
       
     5 The first count was an act of indecency towards a person above the age of sixteen years pursuant to s 61N(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (hereinafter the Act). The second count was one of indecent assault pursuant to s 61L of the Act; the third and fourth counts were attempts to have sexual intercourse without consent, in circumstances of aggravation, namely by threatening to inflict actual bodily harm upon the complainant by means of an offensive weapon pursuant to ss 61P and 61J(1) of the Act; the fifth count was one of sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation by threatening to inflict actual bodily harm pursuant to s 61J(1) of the Act.  
      
       
     6 On 11 December 2000 her Honour sentenced the appellant to a fixed term of twelve months imprisonment commencing on 16 October 2000 in relation to the first count; a fixed term of two years imprisonment commencing on 16 October 2000 with respect to the second count; fixed terms of three years imprisonment commencing on 16 October to be served concurrently in relation to the third and fourth counts and imprisonment for eight years commencing on 16 October 2000 in relation to the fifth count with a non-parole period of four years to date from 16 October 2000 and to expire on 15 October 2004 to be served in a juvenile detention facility. The appellant does not seek leave to appeal against sentence. 
      
       
     7 The appellant was born on 21 April 1981 and was accordingly nineteen years of age at the date of trial and sentence. Each of the offences was alleged to have been committed on 9 August 1998 when he was seventeen years of age.  
      
       
     8 Ten grounds of appeal were filed. However, grounds 2 and 10 have been abandoned. 
      
       
     9 The relevant facts may be summarised for present purposes as follows: the complainant was Olive Victoria Hutchins, who in August 1998 was aged eighty-two years and living in a unit in Legacy Units at MacAuley Street, Deniliquin. On the evening of Saturday, 8 August 1998 she went to sleep, having read until about 11 pm. The book she was reading was entitled “Solo” by Jack Higgins and had been borrowed by the complainant from the Central Murray Regional Library located in Napier Street, Deniliquin on the previous Thursday. 
      
       
     10 In the early hours of the morning of 9 August, she heard noises in her unit which caused her to wake up. She then turned on her bedside lamp and resumed reading the book. About half an hour later she heard more sounds as daylight was breaking and she then saw a male standing at the end of her bed. He was naked except for what she described as a balaclava or beanie which looked like the lower part of a pullover which had just been “cobbled together”. It came down to the man’s shoulders and it contained two slits for eyeholes. He then produced a knife with a bone handle about six inches long. She said: “Are you the chap that was here twelve months ago?”. He replied: “No”. He then walked up to the side of her bed with his penis in his hands and said words to the effect, “Put this in your mouth”. The complainant replied, “I will not”. 
      
       
     11 The intruder then snatched the book out of the complainant’s hand and threw it to the other side of the bed. It landed in front of a piece of furniture right underneath the windows. 
      
       
     12 The intruder then put the knife to the complainant’s throat and threw the blankets back off the bed. He then threw the knife down on to the floor. He then removed the clothing covering the top half of the complainant’s body. The complainant informed him that she had had three heart operations. 
      
       
     13 The intruder then committed the subject offences. 
      
       
     14 The complainant commenced gasping for breath and she asked the intruder to fetch her heart tablets which were in a bottle in the kitchen. The intruder went to the kitchen and returned with the bottle. 
      
       
     15 The complainant took one of the tablets and she was then again assaulted sexually. The intruder then left the bedroom to go to an adjoining room in the apartment and when he returned he was dressed. He then grabbed the complainant by the throat with both hands, squeezing her. The complainant started gasping for breath and tried to break his hold.  
      
       
     16 Having released her neck he then restored her pyjama top and pyjama pants and singlet which he had earlier removed and walked out of the room in the direction of the lounge room.  
      
       
     17 When the intruder returned to the bedroom he was holding the knife and he said: “I’ll let you live if you promise not to tell anyone about this or report what has happened”. At this stage he had the knife resting on the complainant’s throat. 
      
       
     18 He said: “If I hear that you’ve reported this I’ll come and kill you and then I’ll search out your children and kill them”. He asked her to promise that she would not report the matter and she said, “Yes”. He then left the premises. 
      
       
     19 The complainant endeavoured to telephone the police without success and thereupon she rang for an ambulance. When the ambulance officers arrived they rang the police. Shortly thereafter the local police arrived, the complainant gave them a brief report on what had happened to her and she was taken by ambulance to the local hospital.  
      
       
     20 Between 10 am and 10.30 am she was examined by Dr Christina Port. 
      
       
     21 The complainant gave evidence that the intruder’s hair was three different shades, “It was black at the back and then it was bright orange and then the front of it looked as if he’d been combing it with water on a comb and that part was much lighter. Lighter than orange. So it was more or less lemon, orange and black.” (T 20) 
      
       
     22 She was able to give a description of the intruder’s hair because he had removed the makeshift balaclava prior to actually assaulting her. 
      
       
     23 The complainant said she noticed that “he had a dark coloured spot like a freckle on his right shoulder”, which was “like a mole only not raised up very much, it was just like a large round freckle”. She said it was almost in the middle of the shoulder blade (T 21). 
      
       
     24 The complainant said during the course of her evidence that she kept her eyes shut most of the time because of the knife. When asked about his clothing her best recollection was that he had a pair of jeans but could not say what colour. She thought the intruder was poorly spoken. She said he was of no particular ethnic origin, “Just an Ozzie” (T 36). She said he was about five feet ten inches in height. 
      
       
     25 She was asked in cross-examination whether she could estimate the age of the intruder. She replied: 
      
       
        
         
         “Well that’s rather hard to say --- It was hard to say when he was done up like a clown isn’t it. I would say approximately around 23-25 something like that.” (T 36) 
         
        
       
     26 Ms Bronwyn Isabel Chaplin, a member of the library staff at the Deniliquin Library was called by the Crown. She deposed that the appellant had completed a library membership application on 30 August 1994. The records revealed that he had only once borrowed a book from the library and that was on 30 August 1994. The evidence did not disclose the title of the book. 
      
       
     27 The appellant’s mother was not a borrower at the library at the date of the offences. She did not become registered until 20 August 1998, which was, of course, subsequent to the alleged offences. 
      
       
     28 No specific history for the borrowing of “Solo” could be produced in evidence as the volume was wiped from the computer records when given to police officers following the assault. However, borrowings prior to 1994 indicated that the volume was popular. 
      
       
     29 It will be necessary to consider Ms Chaplin’s evidence in more detail when considering grounds 5 and 6. 
      
       
     30 Senior Constable Gregory Mercer attached to Deniliquin Police gave evidence that about a month after the offence he observed the appellant in Deniliquin and noticed that his hair was different from when he had seen him on prior occasions. He said that “… it had been coloured on top, it was blondish in appearance with dark underneath” (T 82). 
      
       
     31 When asked what was meant by that description he said, “It’s like when the, at that particular time a lot of the youths around the Deniliquin area were dyeing their hair on top and just having the shaved section underneath, which was, I suppose, the original colour” (T 82). 
      
       
     32 Detective Senior Sergeant O’Sullivan, a fingerprint expert attached to the Coffs Harbour Crime Scene Unit, gave evidence that he attended the complainant’s unit in Deniliquin in 9 August 1998. He carried out an extensive examination of the exterior and interior of the premises for latent fresh fingerprints. There were no fingerprints developed on any of the objects except the book entitled “Solo” by Jack Higgins. On that book two latent fingerprints were developed on the rear cover. 
      
       
     33 At a later time Detective O’Sullivan was provided with a set of inked fingerprint impressions of the appellant. He then conducted a comparative analysis of the fingerprints found on the book with those of the appellant. He concluded that the fingerprints were identical. 
      
       
     34 Both fingerprints were identical, in Detective O’Sullivan’s view, with the left thumb impression of the appellant.  
      
       
     35 He stated that the quality of the prints was extremely good and that they were fairly fresh. He estimated that the prints could have been on the book for up to one month. That was a conservative estimate, meaning that one month was the outside limit. 
      
       
     36 No fingerprints were located on any other objects in the bedroom or any part of the unit. 
      
       
     37 The appellant’s family moved to Orange, it would appear, towards the end of 1998. On 28 November 1999 Detective Joice, the officer in charge of the case attached to Deniliquin Police, attended the home of the appellant at Orange and put the relevant allegations to him. The appellant replied, “Don’t know her and don’t know nothing about it”. When the appellant was placed under arrest he said, “… this is bullshit, I didn’t do it” (T 92). The appellant was taken to Orange Police Station and agreed to be interviewed by way of ERISP. The appellant denied the allegations put to him in the interview. 
      
       
     38 The following questions and answers in the ERISP are of relevance: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q44 What about reading, did you enjoy reading and things like that. 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q45 Were you a member of the library? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q46 So you’re not a, you don’t visit the library to borrow books or anything?” 
         
        
        
       And later: 
        
        
         
         “Q89 … I think I asked you earlier about your reading --- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q89 --- and you said that you, you didn’t do a lot of reading. 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q90 Have you ever heard of the book Solo> 
         
        
        
         
         A (NO AUDIBLE REPLY) 
         
        
        
         
         Q91 You’ve never read it? 
         
        
        
         
         A No. I only used to read at school and that was just school books. 
         
        
        
         
         Q92 Right. What about Library books? 
         
        
        
         
         A Well, probably stuff like, you know, UFOs and stuff, I was, probably read at school books in libraries and that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q93 But that’s the school library, not the town library? 
         
        
        
         
         A No, I’ve never been there. Well, I’ve been there to go on the computers. 
         
        
        
         
         Q94 Right. When was the last time you were at the library? 
         
        
        
         
         A I don’t know, probably about two, three years ago. 
         
        
        
         
         Q95 And you didn’t make a habit of looking through books while you were at the library? 
         
        
        
         
         A No, I just went there to type on their computers.” 
         
        
       
     39 The appellant was asked if he would consent to the holding of an identification parade and he agreed. One was not held. Detective Joice stated that the reasons for that were that there was a significant change in appearance of the appellant from the time of the offences to the time when he was arrested. There was also a problem in that the complainant, because of her age, had difficulty in travelling and held fears of confronting her alleged attacker. Detective Joice took a number of photographs of the appellant’s chest and shoulders. These photographs demonstrated that at the time of the photograph the appellant did not have a mole or freckle on his shoulder blade as described by the complainant.  
      
       
     40 The appellant called no evidence at the trial and did not give evidence himself. In his address to the jury, Mr Rolfe for the appellant relied upon the denials in the ERISP. No redirections were sought by either party at the conclusion of the summing-up. 
      
       
     41 The jury retired at 3 pm on 16 October. After the jury had retired her Honour received a question from the jury in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Your Honour in your summing-up you listed six points of importance in identification. The jury would like to see a list of these six points either on paper or tape.” 
         
        
       
     42 With the consent of the parties her Honour then downloaded from the court reporter’s tape that part of her summing-up in which she dealt with identification, as part of her directions upon the circumstantial evidence upon which the Crown relied. 
      
       
     43 It was common ground, however, that what the jury was seeking was a repetition of the aspects of the evidence which the Crown relied upon in combination to support its case of circumstantial evidence. There were in fact eight such points. 
      
       
     44 However, by agreement, the jury was not provided with a copy of those directions but the legal representatives drafted a document in answer to the jury’s question. This document sets out in summary form the specific circumstances relied upon by the Crown and the responses by the appellant. I set that document out verbatim: 
      
       
        
         
         “Now let me deal with the circumstantial evidence in this case. The circumstances relied upon by the Crown are: 
         
        
       
     · Mrs Hutchens description of her assailant. 
      
       
     · Det Mercer’s description of the accused when he saw him on 12/9/98. 
      
       
     · Mrs Hutchens description of the assailant’s actions in snatching the book from her hands and throwing it to the side of the room. 
      
       
     · The fact that the accused’s thumbprint was found on the book (Ex ..) which Mrs Hutchens was reading at the time; that print could not in the opinion of Mr Sullivan have been on the book for more than one month as at 9/8/98. 
      
       
     · Mrs Hutchens evidence that she went to the library every Thursday to change her library books (9/8/98 being a Sunday) 
      
       
     · The library records (Ex J) and the evidence of Ms Chapman which establishes that the accused last borrowed a book on 31/8/94 and that between 22/11/94 and 18/8/98 no books were borrowed by the accused or any member of his family. 
      
       
     · Ms Chapman’s evidence that it was the library practice to clean and re-cover library books, and that the book ‘Solo’ was a frequently borrowed book. 
      
       
     · The accused’s answers in the record of interview to the effect that he did not go to the local library to read books and that the last time he had been there was about 2-3 years before November 1999.” 
      
       
        
         
         The Crown seeks to prove that it was the accused who assaulted Mrs Hutchens by the combination of these circumstances or pieces of evidence. You should look at all of these circumstances together when you are considering whether you are satisfied that it was the accused; one of them in isolation may not be sufficient to satisfy you to that standard but it is the combination upon which the Crown relies. 
         
        
        
         
         As to these circumstances, the accused says the following: 
         
        
        
         
         Orange/lemon as opposed to blonde; practice of youths at that time to dye top of hair. Accused was 17 at time of assault not 23-25. 
         
        
        
         
         Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the accused came into contact with that book in the month preceding the assaults somewhere other than the library and other than in Mrs Hutchen’s premises, that is sometime before it was borrowed by Mrs Hutchens. 
         
        
        
         
         If you came to the view that such an explanation was a reasonable one, then it would follow that you would have to acquit the accused of all charges.” 
         
        
       
     45 After a short adjournment the jury returned with their verdicts of guilty. 
      
       
     46 There was no issue at the trial as to the fact that Mrs Hutchins had been assaulted in the way in which she claimed. The ultimate issue left for the jury’s resolution was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was the appellant. No challenge was made by the solicitor for the appellant at the trial to the reliability or veracity of any witness. 
      
       
     47 It is convenient to deal with the grounds of appeal in the order and in the manner in which they were argued. I turn then firstly to grounds 5 and 6 which were argued together. They are in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “5. A miscarriage of justice occurred in that the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the effect of the evidence relating to the cleaning and recovering of books borrowed from the Deniliquin Library (p 11 SU). 
         
        
        
         
         6. A miscarriage of justice occurred in that the trial judge failed to accurately refer to the nature and effect of evidence given by Bronwyn Isabel Chaplin concerning the records and conduct of Deniliquin Library.” 
         
        
       
     48 By way of introduction it should be noted that the unchallenged evidence which went to the jury was that neither the appellant nor the members of his family with whom he lived, had borrowed any book from the Deniliquin Library between 22 November 1994 (when the appellant’s brother borrowed a book) and 18 August 1998 (when the appellant’s mother became a registered borrower at the library). It necessarily follows (to state the obvious) that over that period neither the appellant nor any member of his family borrowed the book “Solo”.  
      
       
     49 Further, according to the unchallenged evidence of Detective O’Sullivan, the appellant’s thumb prints could not have been placed on the book “Solo” more than one month prior to 9 August 1998, the date of the offences.  
      
       
     50 Notwithstanding this unchallenged evidence, it is said that a critical issue for the jury to determine was whether there was a reasonable possibility that the fingerprints could have been innocently placed on the book prior to the offences.  
      
       
     51 I quote hereunder the fourth to seventh circumstance relied upon by the Crown in its case on circumstantial evidence as summarised by her Honour (SU pp 10-11): 
      
       
        
         
         Fourthly, the fact that the accused’s thumb print was found on the book which Mrs Hutchins was reading at the time and that the print could not, in the opinion of Mr Sullivan, the fingerprint expert, have been on the book for more than one month as at 9 August 1998. You will have the photographs which demonstrate where precisely on the book the thumb print was located. 
         
        
        
         
         Fifthly, Mrs Hutchins’ evidence that she went to the library every Thursday to change her library books, 9 August 1998 being a Sunday, so she had, the Crown says, by a matter of inference picked up the book Solo, the Thursday prior to the Sunday 9 August. 
         
        
        
         
         Sixthly, the library records and the evidence of Mrs Chapman (sic) which establishes that the accused last borrowed a book on 31 August 1994 and that between 22 November 1994 and 18 August 1998 no books were borrowed by the accused or any member of his family from that library. 
         
        
        
         
         Seventhly, Mrs Chapman’s (sic) evidence that it was the library practice to clean and recover the library books and that the book Solo was a frequently borrowed book, and lastly the accused’s answers in the record of interview to the effect that he did not go to the local library to read books, and that the last time he had been there was about two to three years before November 1999.” 
         
        
       
     52 With regard to ground of appeal 5, it was argued that the summary of the seventh circumstance did not accurately summarise Ms Chaplin’s evidence.  
      
       
     53 I turn then to the relevant parts of Ms Chaplin’s evidence.  
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Are you able to say in view of the entries that appear on the card at the beginning of the book, the pocket at the beginning of the book as to whether or not this is a frequently requested book? 
          
         A. It is a frequently borrowed book. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In fact you have a number of Jack Higgins titles in the library? 
          
         A. Yes we have. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Again is it fair to say that he is a popular author? 
          
         A. It’s very fair to say that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In relation to the books which are used a lot, what type of maintenance is kept on these books? 
          
         A. If library book comes back and it’s dirty or dusty, which often happens, we would use either the wipes that are purchased at the grocery store and wipe them down or we would take them out the back and just spray them with a bit of Spray ‘n’ Wipe and wipe that off. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you say Spray ‘n’ Wipe, that being a detergent of sorts? 
          
         A. Yes, a kitchen detergent spray bottle product. And  
         if the cover was wrecked, like this one is now 
         , it would have to be recovered and we have recoverers that work every – volunteers that work every Monday morning and they recover books and cover new ones for Monday mornings.” (T 61) 
         
        
       
     54 Counsel for the appellant focussed particularly upon the words italicised above “if the cover was wrecked, like this one is now”, which was of course, a reference to “Solo”. 
      
       
     55 It was submitted that this evidence pointed to the fact that there was no reason to suppose the subject book had been recovered recently (or at all) because its condition suggested an old “wrecked” cover. Further, it was submitted, there was no evidence from which to draw a conclusion that the book had ever been wiped.  
      
       
     56 It was submitted that the direction by her Honour that there was a “practice to clean and recover the library books” was not in fact the evidence. There were in fact contingencies, it was submitted, which might lead to the recovering of a book. The first contingency was that the state of the cover might lead to recovering. By inference the evidence suggested that the book had not been recovered for some considerable time. The second contingency was that the book would be wiped if it was dirty or dusty. There was no evidence to suggest that it had ever occurred with the subject book. Indeed its neglected state might suggest otherwise.  
      
       
     57 In combination these misdirections, it was argued, supported a false conclusion that it was unlikely that there had been contact with the book by the appellant (other than on the morning of the offences) and even if there had been any earlier fingerprints they would have been physically removed by the library “practice”. 
      
       
     58 No objection was taken at the trial to the direction which her Honour gave as quoted above. The Crown was perfectly entitled to call evidence of a standing procedure within the library for the cleaning and recovering of books that are in need of such treatment. Every Monday morning volunteers performed this work. The subject book was a frequently borrowed book and would inevitably be subject to frequent scrutiny by the volunteers when it was returned. 
      
       
     59 I am quite unpersuaded that her Honour was under any obligation when referring to this practice or system, however one wishes to describe it, to subject the evidence to the detailed analysis suggested by counsel for the appellant. The direction, in my view, was a perfectly appropriate one. 
      
       
     60 In my view the submissions do not justify leave being granted by this Court to the appellant to rely upon this ground. 
      
       
     61 I turn then to ground of appeal 6. 
      
       
     62 This ground focuses upon the sixth circumstance outlined in her Honour’s direction. Again no objection was taken to this direction at trial. It is argued that the summation of the evidence appears to be incorrect and unduly to favour the prosecution case.  
      
       
     63 Relevantly Ms Chaplin deposed that prior to 25 February 1994 a manual system of membership and borrowing operated. After this date a manual system of application for membership was retained and a computerised system of borrowing was adopted but with intermittent “glitches” when the manual system was resurrected (T 63). 
      
       
     64 When the subject book was released by the library to investigating police officers in January 2000, Ms Chaplin said, “… because we wrote the book off out of the system and cancelled it as one of our stock we have no records on the computer for it” (T 63) 
      
       
     65 Then it was put to her in cross-examination:  
      
       
        
         
         “So subsequent to 25 February 1994 you were not in a position to say who borrowed this book or how many times it went out other than the fact that it went out a large amount of times, you’d accept that?” 
         
        
        
       Ms Chaplin replied, “Yes” (T63/64).  
        
       
     66 Later in her cross-examination by Mr Rolfe for the appellant, the following evidence was given: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Well just so I’m not confusing anybody, after February of 1994 if someone came in and said I want to borrow this book, and they came to the counter, you would open up the book and you would scan the bar code on the book would you? 
          
         A. Yes if they were already a member. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes, and that would go straight into the computer, and the computer would then have a record of the fact that that person borrowed that book? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And then that enables the computer when you print out these member maintenance records to say when it was that the person last borrowed a book? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The fact that that data’s already in there? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         ROLFE: Q. When the book was removed from the system in January of this year written off as such, does the computer just remove any detail from it from people’s lobby (sic) maintenance records, so that it no longer – what I’m asking you is if we could (sic) Mrs Hutchins as an example, if Mrs Hutchins had have borrowed the book last, if the book was, if she had have borrowed it in January, just prior to it being written off, and then the book’s written off, if you called her record up would it show on her record that she’d borrowed the book? 
          
         A. No it doesn’t. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. No it doesn’t? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Now I’m a bit confused. 
         
        
        
         
         ROLFE: Do you wish me to continue? 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Well no no, it was just that you directed the witness’s attention to having borrowed that book. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I was curious about was whether or not if the book is written off the system as Mr Rolfe has suggested does that mean that when you print out the member maintenance record for Mrs Hutchins that it would not show when she last borrowed ie (as said) wouldn’t show that if it was that book that you’d written off that she last borrowed that would be wiped from the? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It would be wiped would it? 
          
         A. Yes.” (T 66) 
         
        
       
     67 It was submitted that this was critical evidence as it appeared to demonstrate that there was no proof that the appellant or his family had not borrowed the subject book. The trial judge’s summing-up therefore was completely at odds with the actual evidence.  
      
       
     68 It is not entirely clear what records would have remained within the library’s computer system if this particular book had not been handed to the police and wiped from the system. But even if one made the assumption (the correctness of which I doubt) favourable to the appellant that the system would have had a record of all persons who had borrowed this book since its acquisition by the library, then I fail to understand how that could assist the appellant’s case. As I have already made clear the unchallenged evidence was that neither the appellant nor any member of his family borrowed any book from the library between 20 February 1994 and 18 August 1998. In my view this ground is misconceived and I would refuse the appellant leave to rely upon it.  
      
       
     69 Ground 9 was the next ground addressed by counsel for the appellant. It is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “9. A miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the trial judge failing to warn the jury of the danger of convicting the appellant on the evidence of the fingerprint given the delay between the commission of the offence and the arrest of the appellant. 
         
        
       
     70 There was a delay of almost sixteen months between the commission of the offences on 9 August 1998 and the interview and arrest of the appellant by police officers in Orange on 28 November 1999. No evidence was led at the trial to explain the delay in the appellant being interviewed.  
      
       
     71 This ground must be examined in light of the appellant’s submission that the Crown failed to eliminate beyond reasonable doubt the possibility that prior to 9 August 1998 the appellant had innocently touched the subject book in circumstances of which he was unaware or had no recollection.  
      
       
     72 It was submitted that the longer the delay between the offences and the arrest of an accused, the more unlikely it becomes that the accused can give an explanation for the appearance of a fingerprint on a moveable and relatively prosaic object such as a book, or to raise an alibi. It was submitted that the jury should have been told of the difficulty of defending this matter where there had been such a considerable delay. As the majority of the High Court (Brennan, Dawson, Toohey JJ) pointed out in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 86, the general law requires a warning to be given whenever a warning is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case citing Bromley v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 315 at 319, 323-325 and Carr v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 314 at 330..  
      
       
     73 Reliance was placed by the appellant upon the later observations of the majority in Longman (at p 91): 
      
       
        
         
         “But there is one factor which may not have been apparent to the jury and which therefore required not merely a comment but a warning be given to them: see  
         Reg v Spencer 
          [1987] AC at 141. That factor was the applicant’s loss of those means of testing the complainant’s allegations which would have been open to him had there been no delay in prosecution. Had the allegations been made soon after the alleged event, it would have been possible to explore in detail the alleged circumstances attendant upon its occurrence and perhaps to adduce evidence throwing doubt upon the complainant’s story or confirming the applicant’s denial. After more than twenty years that opportunity was gone and the applicant’s recollection of them could not be adequately tested. The fairness of the trial had necessarily been impaired by the long delay (see  
         Jago v District Court (NSW)  
         (1989) 168 CLR 23) and it was imperative that a warning be given to the jury. The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     74 Further, support for the ground of appeal was sought to be obtained by the appellant from the judgment of Williams J in R v Peel (1999) 2 Qd R 400 esp at 410.  
      
       
     75 Peel was appealing from his conviction, inter alia, on one count of attempted arson of a dwelling house at Townsville.  
      
       
     76 The Crown case was that Peel had thrown a Diet Coke bottle filled with a flammable substance at the house. Investigating police located a number of broken pieces of glass from a Diet Coke bottle at the scene including one piece which still retained the label. The appellant’s fingerprints were located on the label.  
      
       
     77 The appellant elected not to give evidence and the trial judge gave the jury a direction in accordance with Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217 to the effect that the jury might draw inferences adverse to Peel more readily by considering that he, being in a position to deny or explain or answer how his fingerprints came to be on the bottle has failed to do so.  
      
       
     78 Williams J said, at 410: 
      
       
        
         
         “One can readily understand the dilemma faced by an innocent person in the position of this appellant. Was it the Coke bottle I placed in the rubbish bin at home on 1 September 1995 after consuming its contents? Was it the Coke bottle I picked up at the supermarket on 15 September 1995 but returned to the shelf because it was not cold enough? Was it the Coke bottle I had used for some to store fuel for the motor mower before discarding it at the rubbish dump? And so on. How could it be said that any person whose fingerprints happened to be found on the label of a Coke bottle was in possession of knowledge as to how those fingerprints came to be there when there was no other evidence linking the person to the coke bottle (particularly where the question was raised for the first time many months after the fingerprints had been deposited). 
         
        
        
         
         The simple fact is that there was no basis at all for the learned trial judge concluding that this appellant had knowledge as to how his fingerprints came to be on the Coke bottle in question. For that reason it was not a  
         Weissensteiner 
          situation. 
         
        
        
         
         In effect what the learned trial judge was saying in this case was that because the appellant’s fingerprints were on the bottle he was under some obligation to go into the witness box and swear on oath that he did not commit the crime. That, and that alone, is the only material question which could have been asked of the appellant; did you prepare or throw this Molotov cocktail?  
         Weissensteiner  
         clearly does not compel an accused person to do that. The  
         Weissensteiner 
          direction in this particular case completely eroded the appellant’s rights.” 
         
        
       
     79 This view did not obtain the support of the other judges on the Court of Appeal, McMurdo P and Pincus JA, who both took the view that a Weissensteiner direction was appropriate.  
      
       
     80 Of course the first observation to be made here is that in the instant case the judge did not give a Weissensteiner direction and, indeed, made no comment at all with regard to the election by the appellant not to give evidence or to call evidence. Her Honour made it clear to the jury that the appellant relied upon his denials in the ERISP and the alleged deficiencies in the Crown case. 
      
       
     81 There is a clear difference between a Diet Coke bottle, of which there were no doubt countless in Townsville at the time of the offences alleged to have been committed by Peel, and the case of the book “Solo” in the instant case. At all relevant times there was only one copy of the book “Solo” held by the Deniliquin Library. 
      
       
     82 I do not consider that the present appellant obtains any real assistance from Peel’s case so far as the subject ground of appeal is concerned.  
      
       
     83 When one considers Longman’s case, it must be remembered that the delay between the alleged offences and the complaint which motivated police officers to interview Longman was to the order of twenty years. This was, of course, a vastly longer period of delay than in the instant case. 
      
       
     84 In considering whether there was any obligation on Judge Latham to give a direction of the nature outlined in this ground of appeal it is appropriate to consider briefly some authority relating to the cogency of fingerprint evidence.  
      
       
     85 In R v Castleton (1909) 3 Cr App R 74, a conviction for breaking and entering was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal when there was no other evidence of identity of the accused. Castleton is still cited in the current editions of “Cross on Evidence” and “Phipson on Evidence”.  
      
       
     86 In Parker v The King (1912) 14 CLR 681 the High Court was concerned with an application for special leave to appeal from a decision of the Court of General Sessions at Melbourne. The applicant had been convicted of breaking into a shop and dwelling and stealing therefrom the contents of a safe. 
      
       
     87 The only evidence against the applicant depended upon a comparison of one of several fingerprints found on a bottle which was in the shop during the relevant period with a print of the middle finger of the applicant’s left hand which was taken in gaol.  
      
       
     88 The High Court (Griffith CJ, Barton and Isaacs JJ) refused leave. In refusing leave the Chief Justice said, on behalf of the Court: 
      
       
        
         
         “We think that leave must be refused. We are asked to allow the point to be argued whether, when evidence of finger prints is the only evidence of identity, it is sufficient to support a conviction. Leave is asked in the hope that the rule may be laid down that it is not. Signatures have been accepted as evidence of identity as long as they have been used. The fact of the individuality of the corrugations of the skin on the fingers of the human hand is now so generally recognized as to require very little, if any, evidence of it, although it seems to be still the practice to offer some expert evidence on the point. A finger print is therefore in reality an unforgeable signature. That is now recognized in a large part of the world, and in some parts has, I think, been recognized for many centuries. It is certainly now generally recognized in England and other parts of the British Dominions. If that is so, there is in this case evidence that the prisoner’s signature was found in the place which was broken into, and was found under such circumstances that it could only have been impressed at the time when the crime was committed. It is impossible under those circumstances to say there was no evidence to go to the jury.” 
         
        
       
     89 A recent judgment in some respects similar to the instant case is that of Moreshead v Police [1999] SASC 162 (16 April 1999). In that case Debelle J was concerned with an appeal against conviction by a magistrate of the appellant for illegal interference with a motor vehicle.  
      
       
     90 Mr and Mrs Henshelwood, the owners of the motor vehicle, operated a shop in Mt Gambier. The car had been parked in the front yard of their house overnight. The next morning Mr Henshelwood noticed that someone had interfered with the car. Two doors had been opened. The contents of the glove box and a tray in the dashboard were strewn over the floor and seats of the car.  
      
       
     91 Three pieces of paper were later removed from the front seat and were examined for fingerprints. One was a facsimile copy of a price list. It was not disputed before the magistrate that the price list bore a thumb print identical with the print of the appellant’s left thumb. The prosecution case was the only explanation for the fingerprint being upon the price list was that the appellant was the person who had illegally interfered with the car.  
      
       
     92 Evidence was given by Mr Henshelwood that the price list was a confidential document which was kept in a position within the shop so that it could not have been seen by or handled by customers.  
      
       
     93 The appellant gave evidence that he was a frequent customer at the shop. The magistrate said that the appellant was not able to suggest that he had any specific memory of a time when he could have innocently touched the price list and put his thumb print on it. All that he said was that it could have happened on one of those occasions when he was visiting or a customer at the shop.  
      
       
     94 His Honour referred to the fact that the magistrate rejected the explanation of innocent touching, stating that it was “so remote as to be fanciful”.  
      
       
     95 The magistrate concluded that the prosecution had excluded any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the appellant’s evidence. In dismissing the appeal, Debelle J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The magistrate’s conclusion was clearly open to him. The prosecution had proved the practices adopted by Mr Henshelwood and his staff in running the shop. The price list was a confidential document which would not be left in a place where it could be seen, let alone touched, by customers. The magistrate accepted Mr Henshelwood’s evidence. It was highly unlikely that the appellant could have inadvertently and innocently touched the price list. Furthermore, a thumb print suggests more than a mere inadvertent brushing against the document. Instead it points to the price list being held between the thumb and fingers. 
         
        
        
         
         The magistrate rejected the appellant’s evidence. In any event, the appellant had not adduced any evidence to show how he might have innocently touched the price list. The appellant did not, of course, have to prove anything but it is relevant to note that there was no evidence from the appellant on that issue. In short, the magistrate was justified, on those facts, to conclude that there was a reasonable possibility that the appellant had innocently touched the price list. The effect of the appellant’s case required that there be some contact with the price list in the shop. The appellant’s evidence does not seriously allow for that possibility. The appellant’s case required that, of all the paperwork which was generated in the shop business, it was this price list which came to be in the vehicle and that it was the very price list which the appellant had touched. That is a long line of coincidence, so long that it stretches human credulity to breaking point. 
         
        
        
         
         The magistrate was, in my submission, correct to conclude that the explanation offered was fanciful. He was justified in concluding that the prosecution had excluded any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the appellant’s innocence. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Smith, who appeared for the appellant on this appeal, submitted that the magistrate had erred in that he had treated the evidence of the accused as hypothetical and, on that basis, had wrongly rejected in on that ground alone. He relied on the observations of Fullagar J in  
         Giles v Dodd 
          (1974) VLR 465 at 468 to 469. That was a case depending on its own facts. Furthermore, the magistrate’s reasons indicate that he relied on other grounds. He was not prepared to accept the evidence of the appellant. The explanation of innocent touching had not been supported by evidence and he was entitled to reject it as fanciful. The appeal against the conviction must, therefore, be dismissed. 
         
        
       
     96 The above cases emphasise the cogency which the criminal law attributes to fingerprint evidence.  
      
       
     97 It was unfortunate in the present case that there was a delay of almost sixteen months before the appellant was interviewed. However, I do not consider that the delay, or other circumstances of the case, called for the warning which the appellant contends should have been given consistent with Longman. 
      
       
     98 In my view it would, in the light of all the evidence, have been unrealistic for her Honour to have given the direction suggested. Fairness to the appellant did not require such a direction. No direction along these lines was sought by trial counsel and I do not consider that the appellant should be given leave to rely upon this ground. 
      
       
     99 Ground 4 is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “A miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury as to the manner in which they might deal with the failure of the defence to call evidence.” 
         
        
       
     100 It was submitted that there was a significant danger in this case that the jury might engage in an impermissible line of reasoning relating to the failure of the appellant to give evidence.  
      
       
     101 Further, it was argued there was a significant danger that the jury might engage in an impermissible line of reasoning relating to the failure of the appellant to provide an explanation for the fingerprints on the book. It was submitted that the need for a direction was made all the more necessary by reason of the following comment by her Honour, prior to counsel addressing the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “So when I say you’re not entitled to speculate about matters that haven’t been the subject of evidence what I mean is you can’t go off thinking about things that perhaps could have been done in relation to the semen weren’t done because if there was anything that was relevant I assure you it would have been placed before you.” (T 99) 
         
        
       
     102 In the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 931 at 941, their Honours said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the course of argument of the present matters it was suggested that if a judge said nothing to the jury about the fact that an accused had not given evidence, the jury may use the accused’s silence in court to his or her detriment. Plainly that is so. It follows that if an accused does not give evidence at trial it will almost always be desirable for the judge to warn the jury that the accused’s silence in court is not evidence against the accused, does not constitute an admission by the accused, may not be used to fill gaps in the evidence tendered by the prosecution, and may not be used as a make weight in assessing whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
     103 Again no request for such a direction was sought by the appellant at the trial. Nevertheless, the omission on the part of her Honour to direct the jury in relation to the election of the appellant not to give evidence was said to be a critical defect in the trial. 
      
       
     104 Specifically, in the circumstances it was argued that it was appropriate for her Honour to direct the jury and to warn them that the appellant’s silence in court was not evidence against him; that his silence did not constitute an admission; that his silence may not be used to fill gaps in the evidence tendered by the prosecution and that his silence may not be used as a make-weight in assessing whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. In this particular context, the jury should have been reminded that the onus of proof was always on the Crown to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt in relation to all the essential elements of the charges which it must prove. It is quite impossible to conclude how the jury used the fact that the appellant did not enter the witness box in determining whether the Crown had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  
      
       
     105 In Azzopardi the High Court did not state that such a direction was mandatory in every case. Obviously some element of discretion was left to the trial judge. It is not every case in which counsel for the defence would necessarily consider that his or her client was well served by such a direction. Particularly, as here, where effectively the record of interview was constituted by denials.  
      
       
     106 Indeed this is a case where it would not have been surprising if the Crown had sought a Weissensteiner direction. It is not without significance that defence counsel did not seek any direction in the terms of Azzopardi. This may have well been a sound tactical decision in view of the consistent denials in the ERISP. 
      
       
     107 It may well be that her Honour took the view (and one can understand why she would) that the safer and fairer course would be to make no reference at all to the election by the appellant not to give evidence or call any evidence. 
      
       
     108 I am not persuaded that the appellant has made out a case for an entitlement to leave under Rule 4 to rely upon ground 4 because I do not consider the absence of any direction along the Azzopardi lines constituted a possible miscarriage of justice. Reference may be made to the recent decision of this Court in R v Richards [2002] NSWCCA 38 (28 February 2002) where the same approach was taken. I would therefore refuse leave to the appellant to rely upon this ground. 
      
       
     109 The third ground of appeal is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “A miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the trial judge’s failure to properly direct the jury in relation to circumstantial evidence and the burden of proof.” 
         
        
       
     110 Her Honour gave the following direction in relation to circumstantial evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown case in respect of proof of the identity of Mrs Hutchins’ assailant, being the accused, depends on what we call circumstantial evidence. What that means is that there is no direct evidence in the form of a witness who says ‘I saw the accused commit this crime’. In other words Mrs Hutchins does not come along here and say ‘It was the accused who broke into my flat, it was the accused who stood by my bed, it was the accused who did these things to me’. She does not say that. All she can do is describe the person who did these things. So there is no direct evidence that it was the accused who assaulted her. 
         
        
        
         
         Instead the Crown sets out to prove certain circumstances, that is facts and events which the Crown says, when taken together, prove beyond reasonable doubt, that he is guilty because there is no other reasonable explanation. 
         
        
        
         
         Now it is a perfectly legitimate way for the Crown to prove its case. And just while I am on the subject, Mr Rolfe made a submission to you a short time ago that the Crown called the librarian because they really did not believe their own case. Well I suppose that is one way of looking at it, but really there is a duty upon the Crown to call evidence of matters of that nature, that is who belonged to the library, who borrowed books, when was the last time they borrowed books, things of that nature. The Crown has a duty to call that evidence, in this type of case, in order to exclude all the things that you would naturally think were reasonable explanations consistent with innocence. 
         
        
        
         
         So let me go on to tell you a little bit more about how the Crown proves a circumstantial case. Circumstantial evidence is not necessarily any less reliable than direct evidence, in fact in some cases it can be more compelling than direct evidence. However the point about it is this, before you can find an accused person guilty of a crime on the basis of circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied that such a finding is not only reasonable, but that it is the only reasonable finding to make. 
         
        
        
         
         It follows then that if there is another finding which is reasonably open on the evidence, that is a reasonable explanation which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, then it would be your duty to find the accused not guilty 
         . Now when you consider circumstantial evidence you do so in the light of all the material in the trial. (My italics.) 
         
        
       
     111 Particular criticism was directed to the italicised words in the last paragraph,  
      
       
     112 It was argued that because this direction relates to a “finding” and an “explanation”, it was unfair because the appellant did not give an explanation in evidence or in his interview of how the fingerprint came to be on the book. He vigorously denied the charge but provided no “explanation”. The case for the appellant was essentially that the Crown had not excluded the possibility that the appellant came into contact with the book in the month preceding the assault, somewhere other than in the library and other than in the complainant’s premises (ROS 12-13). 
      
       
     113 It is suggested that her Honour erred in that she has placed some onus on the appellant to explain away or establish his innocence as distinct from the obligation being upon the Crown to eliminate any hypothesis inconsistent with the guilt of the accused. 
      
       
     114 There is authority to the effect that it is preferable to formulate the circumstantial evidence direction by reference to guilt rather than innocence. Reference may be made, for example, to R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298. 
      
       
     115 On the other hand, as counsel for the appellant fairly conceded, there is much authority to justify the direction along the lines which her Honour gave. However, he contended that in the context of this case where there was no warning of the sort referred to under ground 9; where there was no direction about how the jury should deal with the failure of the appellant to testify, and where the judge directed the jury in terms of whether or not an explanation is a reasonable one, that situation in totality created an unfair trial and created a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     116 It was argued that her Honour’s reference to a reasonable explanation consistent with the innocence of the appellant focussed the jury’s mind upon the absence of any explanation from the appellant, and in the absence of any directions about the failure to testify and the absence of any warnings, such as were referred to earlier, created in combination a risk of a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
     117 Counsel for the appellant made it clear that he did not rely upon the third ground of appeal in isolation but necessarily linked it up with the other grounds which I have already referred to and dealt with. For my part, the appellant’s case on ground 3 has been significantly weakened necessarily by the views which I have formed in relation to the earlier grounds of appeal.  
      
       
     118 Nevertheless, I have considered the thrust of the appellant’s argument and noted there was an absence of the directions and warnings which he sought in the earlier grounds of appeal which I have dealt with. I am, however, quite unpersuaded that the manner in which her Honour dealt with circumstantial evidence and the burden of proof could have constituted a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly I would refuse leave to rely upon ground 3. 
      
       
     119 Grounds 7 and 8 are in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “7. A miscarriage of justice occurred in that the trial judge failed to refer the jury to the evidence concerning possible hypotheses consistent with innocence. 
         
        
        
         
         8. A miscarriage of justice occurred in that the trial judge failed to adequately put the defence case to the jury.” 
         
        
       
     120 It was contended under these grounds that a direction concerning how the jury might use the ERISP and view the defence case should have been given. There was no direction in the summing-up as to how the interview might be used by the jury.  
      
       
     121 It was submitted that the absence in the photographs of a mole/freckle on the appellant’s shoulder blade should have been the subject of a specific direction. 
      
       
     122 No direction was given relating to the possibility that a person may not know when or how they had touched an object on which their fingerprint was found. Reliance was sought to be placed in this regard upon the judgment of Williams J in Peel, to which I have earlier referred. 
      
       
     123 Then it was said no direction was given drawing the attention of the jury to the fact that although the appellant did not go to the library to read books as stated in his ERISP, he did attend the library to use the computer thus affording access to the book and the possibility of touching it.  
      
       
     124 It was submitted that the jury should have been directed that they had to consider the possibility (rather than any explanation) that the appellant had touched the book and that there may have been many occasions, given the fact that he attended the library, together with the size of the population of Deniliquin, when he could have been in innocent contact with the book. 
      
       
     125 This Court does not have the benefit of transcript of counsel’s addresses at the trial. Therefore the detail of the matters relied upon by defence counsel is not available.  
      
       
     126 In the summing-up her Honour made it perfectly clear to the jury that the complainant did not identify the appellant as the person who broke into her flat and assaulted her. 
      
       
     127 Her Honour summarised the defence case (without objection from trial counsel) as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Now as to these circumstances the accused says the following. Firstly the accused points to the fact that Mrs Hutchins describes the assailant’s hair as orange or lemony, as opposed to Detective Mercer’s description, which was blonde. Whether or not that is a material inconsistency is a matter for you. 
         
        
        
         
         I have already pointed to the fact that it was the practice of male youths in Deniliquin at that time to dye their hair in that fashion, although Detective Mercer said nothing about the colour, merely that it was the fashion to dye the top of the head in some form or other. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused points says, or points out rather, through his counsel, that he was 17 at the time of these assaults, not 23 to 25. Again whether you think that is a material difference in terms of the description given by Mrs Hutchins and the accused’s appearance is a matter for you. 
         
        
        
         
         Also, the accused points out that the substance of the answers given by the accused in the record of interview, and all of the investigations conducted by the Crown in order to exclude the possibility that the accused had handled this book in some innocent fashion prior to 9 August, all of those investigations and questions were focused on whether or not he borrowed books from that library or read books from that library. There was never any question asked of him which could have ascertained whether he had touched that book at some period prior to 9 August 1998. 
         
        
        
         
         In effect the accused’s case is that the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the accused came into contact with that book in the month preceding the assaults, somewhere other than the library, and other than in Mrs Hutchinson’s (sic) premises, that is sometime before it was borrowed by Mrs Hutchins. That is essentially the accused’s case.” 
         
        
       
     128 It seems to me that her Honour has, in these passages, fairly summarised the crucial aspects of the defence. I am not satisfied that these grounds of appeal have been made out and I would reject them. 
      
       
     129 Finally I turn to the first ground of appeal, which is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
          “A miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the absence at the trial of new evidence.” 
         
        
       
     130 The appellant relied, for the purposes of this ground, upon an affidavit dated 27 May 2002 of the solicitor who represented the appellant at the trial. In pars 2 and 3 of that affidavit, he deposed: 
      
       
        
         
         “I believe that this trial was about the second or third District Court trial I had conducted as advocate. On this occasion I had attempted to brief a public defender to appear in the matter but no public defender was available. 
         
        
        
         
         I did not consult a fingerprint expert in this matter. I spoke to a police officer stationed in the local area who has some expertise on the subject of fingerprints. I also conducted some research of my own. This research was in relation to the identification of fingerprints only. It did not occur to me to consider getting a fingerprint expert’s report in relation to the age of the fingerprints.” 
         
        
       
     131 The appellant also filed an affidavit of Terence Leslie Nesbitt, an independent fingerprinting expert, which contains a report dated 4 March 2002. 
      
       
     132 Mr Nesbitt does not challenge the finding of Detective O’Sullivan that the thumb prints were those of the appellant. However, he seeks to contradict the proposition that the fingerprints found were four weeks or less old. The particular passage in the affidavit upon which the appellant relies is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “The answers given by Detective O’Sullivan are based on subjective speculation and are unlikely to be the result of anybody’s research. His opinion is based on a premise that is misleading because he cannot reliably judge the age of the fingerprint impressions based on the manner in which the fingerprint develops or its appearance after development. The manner in which a fingerprint develops is indicative of its composition and not its predictable chronological age. A fingerprint deposited in sebum or other body secretions could well have an extended life and if the fingerprint is deposited in foreign matter such as oil, grease or food material it (may) well have an indefinite life, save subsequent mechanical damage and may still appear strong and fresh when later developed giving a false indication of its age.” 
         
        
       
     133 Detective O’Sullivan prepared a report responding in detail to the criticisms found in Mr Nesbitt’s report. As to the most significant aspect of the report, being the section relied upon which I have quoted above, Detective O’Sullivan replied as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “To add to that I always carry out examinations with the aid of a strong torch. On some surfaces, such as plastic, this enables me to see latent fingerprints before they are developed. In this case the latent fingerprints were not clearly visible with the use of the torch. This indicated to me that the latent fingerprints were not heavily contaminated by a foreign substance such as hand cream, food or other similar material. It is always my practice to lift fingerprints, that is the use of an adhesive item such as fingerprint lifting tape to remove the developed latent fingerprint from the surface on which it was developed. When lifting fingerprints developed using grey powder I attempt to redevelop the latent fingerprints using black powder because I have a preference for looking at black ridges, so much so that I use black powder on glass. On this occasion the latent fingerprint would not redevelop, this was because there was insufficient material left on the surface. It is the situation that heavy latent deposits can be redeveloped on several occasions because of the amount of material available. Considering the clarity of the original developed latent fingerprint this lack of redevelopment further indicated to me that the latent impression was not heavily contaminated and supports my prior observations and comments.” 
         
        
       
     134 The Crown gave to the Legal Aid Commission notice that it required Mr Nesbitt for cross-examination and the Legal Aid Commission indicated that it required Detective O’Sullivan for cross-examination.  
      
       
     135 This Court agreed to the evidence of Mr Nesbitt and Detective O’Sullivan being taken, but reserved the question whether Mr Nesbitt’s evidence was admissible as fresh evidence consistently with the authorities and the circumstances of this case.  
      
       
     136 It is convenient, despite their length, to quote the following passages from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Gallagher v The Queen, (1985-1986) 160 CLR 371 at 395-396: 
      
       
        
         
         “In a case such as the present, when there was no wrong decision of any question of law or other irregularity at the trial, and the verdict of the jury was not unreasonable or insupportable having regard to the evidence at the trial, it is apparent that the Court of Criminal Appeal can allow the appeal only if it considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred by reason of the fact that the evidence now adduced was not called at the trial. Although many cases have provided a gloss on the words of s 6 and similar provisions, it is important to remember that the fundamental question is whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and that the principles that may be extracted from the authorities ‘should not … regarded as absolute or hard and fast rules’:  
         Green v The King  
         (1939) 61 CLR 167 at 175. The circumstances of cases may vary widely, and it is undesirable to fetter the power of Courts of Criminal Appeal to remedy a miscarriage of justice. I respectfully agree with the statement of King CJ in  
         Reg v McIntee 
         , (1985) 38 SASR 432 at 435, that ‘appellate courts will always receive fresh evidence if it can be clearly shown that failure to receive such evidence might have the result that an unjust conviction or an unjust sentence is permitted to stand’. 
         
        
        
         
         The authorities disclose the three main considerations which will guide a Court of Criminal Appeal in deciding whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred because evidence now available was not led at the trial. The first of these, that the conviction will not usually be set aside if the evidence relied on could with reasonable diligence have been produced by the accused at the trial, is satisfied in the present case, and need not be discussed, although it should be noted that this is not a universal and inflexible requirement: the strength of the fresh evidence may in some cases be such as to justify interference with the verdict, even though that evidence might have been discovered before the trial. Two other matters that should be taken into consideration are whether the evidence is apparently credible (or at least capable of belief) and whether, if believed, the evidence might reasonably have led the jury to return a different verdict. Although I have stated the matters in that way, it will be seen that there has been some difference of expression, if not of opinion, in the judicial discussion of these questions. The combined effect of the two considerations was stated by Rich and Dixon JJ in  
         Craig v The King 
          (1933) 49 CLR 429 at 439, as follows: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘A Court of Criminal Appeal has thrown upon it some responsibility of examining the probative value of the fresh evidence. It cannot be said that a miscarriage has occurred unless the fresh evidence has cogency and plausibility as well as relevancy. The fresh evidence must, we think, be of such a character that, if considered in combination with the evidence already given upon the trial the result ought in the minds of reasonable men to be affected. Such evidence should be calculated at least to remove the certainty of the prisoner’s guilt which the former evidence produced. But in judging of the weight of the fresh testimony the probative force and the nature of the evidence already adduced at the trial must be a matter of great importance.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Perhaps no more elaborate statement of the position can usefully be made.” 
         
        
       
     137 In essence the real issue between the two experts is that Mr Nesbitt does not accept Detective O’Sullivan’s firmly expressed view that the appellant’s fingerprints could not have been placed on the subject book more than four weeks prior to the offences having been committed.  
      
       
     138 During their evidence in chief and cross-examination both experts adhered to the views that they had expressed in their reports and in Detective O’Sullivan’s case, his evidence. 
      
       
     139 There were, however, two particularly significant matters which arose during the course of Mr Nesbitt’s evidence. 
      
       
     140 Firstly, he adhered to the view that mechanical damage can destroy a fingerprint. In this regard the following evidence is relevant and was given during the course of his examination in chief: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. If I can go back to Sergeant O’Sullivan’s response to your report. Page 6, going over to page 7, there is a discussion by him of a process called polymerisation or depolymerisation? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He has explained on page 7 why he expressed the opinion that he did that the plastic surface will destroy a fingerprint in time. It’s virtually an enemy of fingerprints. Do you see that on page 7 of his report? 
          
         A. Yes, I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What’s your response to that? 
          
         A. I think it’s an unknown quantity in this case as to how long a fingerprint would last on that surface. I don’t think sufficient studies have been done into it to determine how long a fingerprint would last. I believe that a fingerprint would last an indefinite amount of time depending on its composition on a surface such as this. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What factors would influence the speed with which a process of destruction referred to here, might take place? 
          
         A.  
         Mechanical damage; subsequent handling of the item can very well impact on its duration 
         ; the very nature of its composition. If composed of very volatile body waste, it could have a short life. Should it be contaminated or composed of other items that have a longer life, then the predictable life of the fingerprint could be unlimited.” (My underlining.) 
         
        
       
     141 This reference to mechanical damage, which was repeated later in Mr Nesbitt’s evidence, is very important in the context of the subject case where the relevant object upon which the fingerprints were found was a frequently handled library book. 
      
       
     142 Secondly, Mr Nesbitt conceded that being able to look at a latent print at a crime scene is the best evidence. During the course of his cross-examination he gave the following evidence (T 30): 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no substitute for being able to go and have a look at a latent print at a crime scene, is there? 
          
         A. I wouldn’t say that.  
         It’s certainly the best evidence 
         . I have examined and conducted thousands of examinations at crime scenes and I have also had an opportunity as a consultant from both sides. I have worked for the prosecution, I have worked for the Royal Commission, I have worked for both sides of the Winchester case. I have had a rare opportunity for a police officer to actually see both sides of both the prosecution and the defence. I have even done cases where I have been on both the prosecution and the defence at the same time, there being no ownership in an expert.” (My underlining.) 
         
        
       
     143 The question then is even if Mr Nesbitt’s evidence could be categorised as fresh evidence, does it have cogency and plausibility as well as relevancy? Would it be of such a character that, if considered in combination with the evidence already given at the trial, the result ought in the minds of reasonable people, be affected? Would such evidence be calculated at least to remove certainty of the appellant’s guilt which the former evidence produced? 
      
       
     144 I am unable to conclude that Mr Nesbitt’s proposed evidence could satisfy these somewhat demanding tests. The potential for mechanical damage to destroy a fingerprint must necessarily render it unlikely that a fingerprint on a frequently handled library book would last for any great duration. In this context of course consideration must be given to Ms Chaplin’s evidence relating to the cleaning and recovering procedures in the library. 
      
       
     145 Secondly, Mr Nesbitt fairly concedes that Detective O’Sullivan had an advantage which he did not have, namely, of examining the latent print at the crime scene which would admittedly be the best evidence. 
      
       
     146 In any event, at the end of the day the evidence led by the Crown at the trial that the fingerprints could not have been on the book for longer than four weeks was not a critical aspect of the Crown case. The Crown had excluded any rational possibility that the appellant had come into contact with the book at any stage prior to the commission of the alleged offences. I am unable to see therefore that Mr Nesbitt’s evidence would have had any realistic impact upon the strength of the Crown case. 
      
       
     147 Thus, in my view, even if the evidence of Mr Nesbitt could have satisfied the primary test of being fresh evidence (which it is not necessary to decide), the evidence, even if believed, would not in my view have reasonably led the jury to return a different verdict or different verdicts. 
      
       
     148 I might say, parenthetically, that in his report Mr Nesbitt made the following observations: 
      
       
        
         
         “Possible deposition scenarios for the two left thumb impressions could be: 
         
        
        
         
         1. gripping the book with the left hand as the perpetrator snatched the book from the victim’s hands as described by the victim. This scenario is consistent with the version of events given by the victim, ie, with the perpetrator holding the knife in his right hand and snatching the book in his left; 
         
        
        
         
         2. holding the book to lift, carry, hand over or receive it either singly or in a pile of other books; 
         
        
        
         
         3. resting the left hand on the rear of the book.” 
         
        
       
     149 Thus the first of the three scenarios adumbrated by Mr Nesbitt precisely fits in with the Crown case. 
      
       
     150 I would reject the first ground of appeal.  
      
       
     151 In my view the appeal should be dismissed. **********

      Judgment 
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
      
       
     2 WOOD CJ at CL: Robert John Grant appeals against convictions recorded, and sentences imposed, following a trial before his Honour Justice Hulme and a jury in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 22 June 2001 at Dubbo. The Appellant was convicted on one count of murder (s. 19A Crimes Act 1900) and on one count of shooting with intent to murder (s. 29 Crimes Act 1900). In respect of the charge of the murder of Ross Shersingh (Count 1) his Honour sentenced the Appellant to imprisonment for 18 years, to commence on 28 November 2001 and to expire on 27 November 2019, with a non-parole period of 13 years, to commence on 28 November 2001 and to expire on 27 November 2014. In respect of the charge of shooting with intent to murder Daniel Bradford (Count 2), his Honour sentenced the Appellant to a fixed term of imprisonment for 5 years, commencing on 28 November 1999 and expiring on 27 November 2004. 
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
     3 The Appellant was born on 29 January 1956, and was aged 43 at the time of the offences. He had been employed, up until a few months before 27 November 1999, at the Lightning Ridge Motor Village, also known as the Newton Hotel or Nobby’s, which was a hotel combined with a caravan park. He had been dismissed from this position after an altercation when he had been intoxicated. He remained a resident of the Lightning Ridge caravan park after his employment ceased. 
      
       
     4 The appellant had spent most of 27 November drinking alcoholic cider and shortly before the events which led to the charges, he had been refused service at the Lightning Ridge Bowling Club because of his intoxicated state. After this he had returned to his caravan where he remained for some little time before re-emerging, shortly after midnight, armed with a rifle. 
      
       
     5 It was the Crown case, in summary, that he was seen at this stage to walk toward Ross Shersingh, Daniel Bradford and Anthony Leeder, as they were talking, and drinking beer, at the rear of a Nissan Patrol utility parked in the car park of the hotel/caravan park. Anthony Leeder noticed him walking toward the car park from the direction of his caravan, carrying something which Mr Leeder first thought to be a broom, or stick, but which was later seen to be a rifle.  
      
       
     6 On the Crown case, the appellant, while holding a rifle at his hip, first shot and killed Ross Shersingh from a distance of about 20 to 25 feet. Its case in respect of this shooting was presented to the jury upon the basis of specific intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, and upon the alternative basis of reckless indifference to human life, and his Honour summed up to the jury accordingly. 
      
       
     7 Having shot Mr Shersingh, the Crown asserted that the appellant chased Mr Bradford around the utility behind which the men had been standing, with the gun aimed at him, until Mr Bradford was able to make good an escape to the nearby drive-through bottle shop. It alleged that, in the course of this pursuit around the utility, a shot was fired by the appellant at Mr Bradford, with intent to kill him. 
      
       
     8 The evidence indicated that two shots were fired, the first of which struck and killed Mr Shersingh and the second of which became lodged in the door of a Mercedes Benz sedan which was parked nearby. The projectile recovered from the deceased was of .22 calibre and, upon testing, it was shown to have been fired by one of the rifles owned by the appellant. The appellant, and at least one other witness, said that they heard two shots fired, with other witnesses saying that they only heard one. Mr Bradford himself said, in his evidence, that he did not recall hearing a second shot, however in a statement, made to police shortly after the shooting, he indicated that he was aware of a second shot having been fired 
      
       
     9 There was evidence from one eyewitness that, at the time of the shots being fired, a male voice called out “you big-noting opal mining cunts”. Both Bradford and Leeder were involved in opal mining. The appellant had recently tried his hand at this activity without any success. 
      
       
     10 The appellant was indicted in respect of the second shooting, with the offence of shoot with intent to murder, and in the alternative with maliciously discharge a loaded firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm.  
      
       
     11 It was the appellant's case at trial, in summary, that he had been drinking since the morning of 27 November 1999 with a friend. Later that day he continued to drink alcoholic cider at the Lightning Ridge bowling club, where he remained until closing time, with the exception of the period between 6.30 and 7.00 pm. During that period he claimed to have returned to his caravan, on the way meeting two men known as Lionel, and Gary Evans, to whom he then lent his guns and some bullets. He asserted that he had lent these two men guns in the past, on a number of occasions, to be used for pig shooting. 
      
       
     12 After lending the guns to the men, he said that he returned to the bowling club, where he remained until approximately 12.09 am. After returning to his caravan and going to bed, he heard a couple of shots outside the caravan, and then went outside to urinate. When he came back inside, he observed that his rifles, a .22 calibre Vostock long rifle, and a Lithgow brand .22 calibre shortened rifle which police later found under a Doona on his bed, had been returned, along with a jacket which he had not seen before. He put the jacket on, in an attempt to ward off mosquitos. It was found to have firearm residue, and a .22 calibre bullet cartridge was found in a pocket. He denied any involvement in the shootings.  
      
       
     13 The appeal against conviction relates to both offences. It is convenient to deal first with the single ground of appeal which concerns the conviction for the murder of Ross Shersingh. 
      
       
        
       Appeal Against Murder Conviction 
        
       
     14 The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in the direction which was given in relation to the relevance of intoxication for a charge of murder where that is dependent upon proof of reckless indifference. The point at issue arises by reason of an amendment to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which in 1995 inserted a new Part 11A into the Act. 
      
       
     15 The directions which his Honour gave to the jury, in relation to the state of mind required for murder, including that involved in reckless indifference were relevantly, for present purposes, as follows: 
      
       
        
        
         
         “ 
         The [appellant] should be found guilty of murder if, and only if, the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt each of the ingredients (i), (ii) and (iii) and one of the elements in subparagraph (iv) below. 
         
        
        
         
         (i) that Ross Shersingh has died. 
         
        
        
         
         AND 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) that his death was caused by a deliberate act; 
         
        
        
         
         AND 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) that the deliberate act was an act of the [appellant] 
         
        
        
         
         AND 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) that at the time the act was done, it was done with -  
         
        
        
         
          (a) an intention to kill; or 
          
          (b) an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, or 
          
          (c) reckless indifference to human life. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         An act is done with  
         reckless indifference to human life 
          if the person doing it –  
         
        
       
     · Then realised that his act was likely to cause death, and· Was prepared to take that chance. 
      
       
        
         
          
         In this context  
         likely 
          means that there was a substantial or real chance as distinct form a mere or remote possibility. The word 
           
         likely 
          is not intended to suggest that death was (or must have been thought to be) more probable than not.  
         
        
        
         
         Intoxication 
           
         – Intoxication of the [appellant] can be taken into account on the question of whether he had one or other of the intentions referred to in subparagraph (iv) (a) and (b) but for no other purpose 
         . 
         ” [Emphasis added]. 
         
        
       
     16 The written directions in relation to manslaughter were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “  
         Manslaughter 
          
          
         If the Crown has not satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt of the ingredients of murder but establishes beyond reasonable doubt each of ingredients (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) below, you should find the accused guilty of manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         (i) that Ross Shersingh has died,  
          
         AND 
          
         (ii) that his death was caused by a deliberate act; 
          
         AND 
          
         (iii) that the deliberate act was an act of the accused, 
          
         AND 
          
         (iv) that the act was both unlawful and dangerous as explained below. 
         
        
        
         
         Unlawful and Dangerous Act 
         
        
        
         
         Included in  
         unlawful 
          acts is the deliberate application of force to another person without that person’s consent. 
         
        
        
         
         An act is  
         dangerous 
          if it is such that a reasonable person in the position of the Accused, i.e. a 43 year old man, apparently experienced in the use of guns, but not intoxicated would have realised that, by that act, the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable (or significant) risk of serious injury. 
         
        
        
         
         Note:  
          
         The “act” referred to is not the death of Ross Shersingh which, in this context, is at most a consequence. 
         
        
        
         
         Intoxication cannot be taken into account in relation to manslaughter. 
         ” 
          
         
        
       
     17 These direction were supplemented by the oral directions which his Honour gave, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         I will start off with the ingredients of murder. Before you can convict of that charge the Crown must establish to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt each of the matters listed in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii), and one of the elements in paragraph (iv) on the first page of the written directions. 
         
        
        
         
         So far as the fourth ingredient on that page is concerned, let me draw your attention to the following matters. Firstly, you need to be satisfied of only one of the three elements in the subparagraph numbered (iv). Secondly, you do not all have to be satisfied of the same one. AS I have said earlier, you do not all have to reach a result in the same way. Thirdly, you do not individually have to be able to choose between the three possibilities so long as you are satisfied that one of them exists… 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Let me also draw to your attention that all of the elements listed in that subparagraph involve a consideration of the accused’s state of mind.  
         
        
        
         
         In the circumstances of this case there is no direct evidence, at least evidence favourable to the prosecution of that state of mind. There is no evidence he said to anyone, before or after the shooting, “I’m going to kill” or “I did kill Mr Shersingh”. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown case depends on your being willing to infer from what he did, assuming that you find it was he that did it, that one or other of the elements listed in subparagraph (iv) existed at the relevant time. 
         
        
        
         
         You could not convict the accused merely because death resulted from any actions of his. If you find it was the accused who was responsible for the death of Mr Shersingh you must consider the question of what his intention was, or intentions were, at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         The third ingredient under subparagraph (iv) is reckless indifference to human life, and that is explained in the notes at the foot of the page. 
         
        
        
         
         Again, you are required to consider the accused’s state of mind, what he was thinking. Did he realise that his act was likely to cause death. Did he go ahead regardless, or prepared to take the chance. 
         
        
        
         
         I draw your attention, also, to the explanation of the word ‘likely’. It is not sufficient if the accused merely realised that death was a possible consequence.  
         
        
        
         
         The final note on page 1 concerns intoxication. It will not surprise you to know that being drunk is not an excuse for all acts otherwise criminal which might be committed in that state. However, parliament, and indeed the law over centuries, has recognised that intoxication is relevant at times. 
         
        
        
         
         One example relevant here, is where it is suggested that a person has a specific intent, for example an intent to kill. If he is so drunk that his mind does not permit him forming any intent at all, it would be wrong to convict as if he did have such an intent. 
         
        
        
         
         What the final note on page 1 does is to confine exhaustively the extent intoxication can be taken into account so far as the charge of murder is concerned.  
         
        
        
         
         On this topic of intoxication there is one further point I should make. Because it is relevant to an issue that the Crown must establish, namely intent, it is not a case of the accused having to prove he was intoxicated, or that his intoxication was significant.  
         It is a case of the Crown proving that, despite whatever evidence of intoxication there is, the accused had the requisite intent as set out in the written directions. Or, although intoxication is not relevant to this, acted with reckless indifference, as indicated. 
         
        
        
         
         I will just repeat that. It is a case of the Crown proving that despite whatever evidence of intoxication there is the accused had the requisite intent. 
         
        
        
         
         That, I think, covers all I need to say by way of directions of law on the ingredients of murder.” 
         
        
       
     18 His Honour then went on to deal with manslaughter by substantially repeating the matters contained in the written directions, including the instruction: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Finally you will note that any intoxication of the accused is irrelevant so far as manslaughter is concerned. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     19 When directing the jury in relation to the offences, which were charged in the alternative, in relation to Mr Bradford, his Honour gave an instruction, both in writing and orally, that 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Intoxication of the accused can be taken into account on the question of whether he had the intent referred to but for no other purpose. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     20 As a result, the jury were directed that intoxication could be taken into account, in this case, in relation to the appellant’s state of mind for murder dependent upon intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, as well as in relation to the counts involving Mr Bradford, but not in relation to murder dependent upon reckless indifference, or in relation to manslaughter.  
      
       
     21 It was submitted, by the appellant, that his Honour should not have drawn the distinction which he did, in the written and oral directions, between an offence of murder dependent upon intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, on the one hand, and one dependent upon reckless indifference, on the other hand. The direction, which it is suggested should have been given, was to the effect that the jury should also have had regard to the appellant’s state of intoxication, when considering whether he had formed the state of mind required for reckless indifference. 
      
       
     22 Although the transcript of the proceedings appears to be incomplete in relation to the discussion between trial counsel, and his Honour, concerning the written directions, we were informed that the point now in issue was specifically taken by defence counsel, and supported then by the Crown Prosecutor. Notwithstanding that consensus, his Honour declined to accede to the submission which was advanced. The Crown, it may be observed, now wishes to take a contrary position to that adopted at trial.  
      
       
     23 Since it cannot now be ascertained whether or not the jury verdict was based upon a finding of specific intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, or upon a finding of reckless indifference, the appellant contends that any misdirection relating to the relevance of intoxication for reckless indifference, could have cost him a chance of an acquittal of the offence of murder.  
      
       
     24 In passing, it may be noted that, for the purpose of sentencing, his Honour found that the appellant had not shot Mr Shersingh with any intention of killing him, but as between an intent to do grievous bodily harm and reckless indifference, he said that he was unable to decide.  
      
       
     25 In these circumstances, the appellant is clearly entitled to rely upon this ground of appeal and does not need leave to argue it.  
      
       
     26 The point at issue is deceptively simple, but it involves a fundamental question of principle, which seems not to have been considered by those responsible for the amendment.  
      
       
     27 In the Second Reading Speech, the Honourable Paul Whelan MLA said that the effect (purpose) of the introduction of Part 11A was to “remove self induced intoxication as a basis for escaping liability in relation to certain offences”: Hansard Legislative Assembly, 6 December 1995, 4278-4279. 
      
       
     28 The explanation for the proposed amendment continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The present law in New South Wales is that a person charged with a criminal offence, including murder, might be acquitted altogether if there is evidence that the accused was so intoxicated at the time of committing the act that there was a reasonable doubt whether the accused had acted intentionally or voluntarily. This reflects the common law as stated by the High Court in the Queen v O’Connor (1981) 146 CLR 64. It reflects the principle that a person should not be held criminally responsible for an act in the absence of proof that the accused acted voluntarily and with the required mental element for an offence. This is also the law in the other common law jurisdictions of Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. 
         
        
        
         
         By contrast, in the case of Regina v Majewski 1977 AC 443, the House of Lords in England held that evidence of self-induced intoxication may be considered in relation to offences of specific intent only, and cannot be considered in relation to offences of basic intent. The Majewski approach reflects generally the position in the code jurisdictions, as well as Canada and the United States of America. An offence of basic intent is an offence which simply requires an intention to perform some act – such as striking a person – rather than one requiring an intention to bring about some consequences, such as striking a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. An offence of specific intent is thus one involving an additional purposive element, that is, a specific purpose or an intention to achieve a particular result. Murder is such an offence.  
         It requires proof that the accused acted with an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm 
         . By contrast, an offence of basic intent requires proof only that the accused intended to commit the act proscribed. Manslaughter is such an offence. It requires proof only that the accused committed an unlawful or dangerous act. 
         
        
        
         
         The effect of Majewski is that a person who kills another while in a state of gross intoxication may be found not guilty of murder but might still be guilty of manslaughter. For the purpose of determining guilt on a manslaughter charge, the accused’s intoxication would not be able to be taken into account. The effect of O’Connor, on the other hand, is that intoxication may be considered in relation to both offences such that a person might be acquitted outright. In 1994 the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General endorsed the Majewski approach in preference to the O’Connor approach for incorporation in the model criminal code. Majewski has consequently been adopted by the Commonwealth in the Criminal Code Act 1995, which codifies chapter 2 of the model criminal code on the general principles of criminal responsibility. 
         
        
        
         
         The preference for the Majewski approach is based on important public policy considerations. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, in particular, took the view that to excuse otherwise criminal conduct in relation to simple offences of basic intent – such as assault – because the accused is intoxicated to such an extent, is totally unacceptable at a time when alcohol and drug abuse are such significant social problems. The standing committee considered that if a person voluntarily  
         takes 
          the risk of getting intoxicated then he or she should be responsible for his or her actions. This Government agrees with and strongly supports this approach. The proposed amendments therefore essentially reflect the approach taken in Majewski, as well as that taken by the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995, which enacts the principles of the model criminal code. 
         
        
        
         
         Under the proposal, intoxication will mean intoxication whether by means of alcohol or drugs. The intoxication must be self-induced. Clearly it would be unfair for intoxication to be disregarded where a person becomes intoxicated due to fraud, reasonable mistake, duress or force. For example, it would be unfair not to allow evidence of intoxication to be considered where a person may unknowingly have had his or her drinks spiked. 
         
        
        
         
         The proposed section 428B lists examples of offences in the Crimes Act which are offences of specific intent for which evidence of intoxication may be taken into account. Murder is listed as an offence of specific intent. In conformity with Majewski, intoxication will not be able to be taken into account on a charge of manslaughter. Some of the specific intent offences are very serious offences, for example, assault with intent to have sexual intercourse. It should be noted, of course, that although evidence of intoxication can be taken into account on such an offence, such evidence will not be able to be considered in relation to a basic offence of assault.” 
         
        
       
     29 The emphasised passage would suggest, on its face, that attention had not been given to the fact that the offence of murder includes cases of reckless indifference and of felony murder, in addition to cases of specific intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm.  
      
       
     30 The amendment takes its context, for present purposes, in the light of the statutory definition of murder. That offence is defined in section 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW): 
      
       
        
         
         “18 Murder and manslaughter defined 
          
           
           (1) (a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be  
            manslaughter. 
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (2) (a) No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section.  
           
          
          
         (b) No punishment or forfeiture shall be incurred by any person who kills another by misfortune only 
         .” 
         
        
       
     31 It is made punishable by s 19A, which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         19A(1) a person who commits the crime of murder is liable to… imprisonment for life” 
         
        
       
     32 In order for an accused to be convicted of a charge of murder dependent upon intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, the Crown has to prove that his or her act (or omission) was intended, that it was voluntary and that it was done (or omitted) in circumstances where he or she had formed the requisite intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. As was pointed out by Gibbs J in Viro v The Queen (1978) 141 CLR 88 at 111-112, the issue in relation to the specific intent “is not whether the accused was incapable of forming the requisite intent, but whether he had in fact formed it”. 
      
       
     33 In order for an accused to be convicted of murder by reckless indifference to human life, the Crown needs to show that he or she knew that the probable result of his or her act (or omission), in this case the act of firing the gun, was to cause the death of another, and knowing of that likelihood (which has to be a substantial or real chance as distinct from a mere possibility) he or she went ahead and did the act regardless: Crabbe v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 464; Royall v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 378; Boughey v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 10 (a code case). To prove murder by reckless indifference to human life, an accused need not be shown to have specifically intended or wanted death to result, only that he or she comprehended that there was a real or substantial likelihood of it occurring, and went ahead regardless. As such, it is strictly not a crime of specific intent (see the decisions on the equivalent offence in Code States such as Regina v Masnec (1962) Tas SR 254 and Vallance v The Queen  (1961) 35 ALJR 182). The Crown must still however show that the accused intended to do the physical act (or omission) involved, and that such act (or omission) was voluntary.  
      
       
     34 Of importance is the circumstance that an awareness or foresight of the consequence of the act (or omission), on the part of the accused personally, is essential for proof of the offence. It is not sufficient that an ordinary or reasonable person would have foreseen the probability of the occurrence being the death of another: Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107. There is, accordingly, an additional element affecting the subjective mental state of the accused, which is to be established in the case of murder by reckless indifference, and which goes beyond the basic intent to do (or omit) the act which brings about death. The mens rea for this form of offence, as was pointed out in Crabbe v The Queen at 470-471, is the knowledge of the offender that death is the probable consequence of his or her act (or omission), to which I would add the decision to go ahead regardless of that consequence. 
      
       
     35 Before the amending legislation, intoxication was a matter which a jury was required to take into account, in accordance with the principles established in The Queen v O’Connor (1981) 146 CLR 64, both in relation to the voluntariness of the act (or omission) bringing about the victim’s death, and in relation to the state of mind of the accused, in whatever form murder was charged. 
      
       
     36 In passing it may be noted that, Barwick CJ observed in O’Connor (at 86) that “… murder does not fit the definition of a crime of specific intent; but yet it is consistently so treated.” 
      
       
     37 That intoxication was relevant, in relation to murder by reckless indifference, not only for the basic intent to do the physical act (or omission) involved, and for voluntariness, but also for the state of mind required for that form of the offence was well established on the authorities: R v Stones (1956) 56 SR (NSW) 25 per the Court at 34; R v Farrell (1964) NSWLR 1143; R v Solomon (1980) 1 NSWLR 321 per Begg J at 343; R v Peterkin (1982) 6 A Crim R 351 per Street CJ at 355; La Fontaine v The Queen (1976) 136 CLR 62; and Royall v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 378. 
      
       
        
       
     38 In relation to the offence of manslaughter, the Crown does not have to prove that the act or omission was done (or omitted) with any specific intent, or that the accused personally appreciated or foresee that the act (or omission) was a dangerous one. The test of dangerousness in this regard, is an objective one, the relevant question being whether a reasonable person, in the position of the accused, would have realised that, by his or her act (or omission), the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable risk of really serious injury: Wilson v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313. 
      
       
     39 Prior to the introduction of Part 11A, it was however necessary for the Crown to establish, where any question of intoxication arose in relation to a charge of manslaughter, (as was the case for murder in its various forms), that notwithstanding its effects, the act (or omission) of the accused bringing about death, was both voluntary and intended (i.e. deliberate): R v Martin (1983) 9 A Crim R 376 and on appeal (1984) 58 ALJR 217. Absent such proof the accused was entitled to an acquittal (The Queen v O’Connor (1980) 146 CLR 64). 
      
       
     40 In the light of that background, I turn to Part 11A of the Crimes Act which draws a clear distinction between offences of which an intention not only to do the relevant act, but also “an intention to cause a specific result”, is an element, and offences which require only proof of an intent to do the relevant act. 
      
       
     41 S 428C provides in relation to “offences of specific intent” that: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Evidence that a person was intoxicated (whether by reason of self-induced intoxication or otherwise) at the time of the relevant conduct may be taken into account in determining whether the person had the intention to cause the specific result necessary for an offence of specific intent. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) However, such evidence cannot be taken into account if the person: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) Had resolved before becoming intoxicated to do the relevant conduct, or  
          
         (b) became intoxicated in order to strengthen his or her resolve to do the relevant conduct. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     42 In the present case there was no evidence to suggest that the appellant had resolved, before becoming intoxicated, to shoot anyone, or that he had become intoxicated, so as to acquire “courage”, i.e. to strengthen his resolve to do so. It was not a case, accordingly falling within the ss (2) exception. 
      
       
     43 The definition section (s 428A) provides that an offence of specific intent “is defined in section 428B”, which in turn provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) an “offence of specific intent” is an offence of which an intention to cause a specific result is an element 
         . 
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the offences referred to  
         in the Table to this section are examples of offences of specific intent. 
          
          Table 
          
         (a) an offence under the following provisions of this Act:

          (c) any other offence by or under any law (including the common law) prescribed by the regulations.” 
          
         
        
       
     44 The primary definition in s 428A(1) appears to have been borrowed from the judgment of Gibbs J in The Queen v O’Connor (1980) 146 CLR 64 at 91, where his Honour observed that “a crime of special intent is a crime of which an intention to cause a particular result is an ingredient.” (Emphasis added). 
      
       
     45 Express provision is then made, by s 428E of the Act, in relation to intoxication in the case of a person who is acquitted of murder, by reason of evidence of his or her intoxication, at the time of the relevant conduct giving rise to that charge: 
      
       
        
        
         
         428E Intoxication in relation to murder and manslaughter 
          
         If evidence of intoxication at the time of the relevant conduct results in a person being acquitted of murder: 
          
          
         (a) in the case of intoxication that was self-induced—evidence 
          
           
           of that intoxication cannot be taken into account in determining whether the person had the requisite mens rea for manslaughter, or 
           
          
         (b) in the case of intoxication that was not self-induced— evidence of that intoxication may be taken into account in determining whether the person had the requisite mens rea for manslaughter. 
         ” 
          
         
        
       
     46 This provision had a direct relevance for the present case, since there was no suggestion, upon the evidence, other than that the appellant’s intoxication was self-induced. For this reason, the direction that intoxication could not be taken into account for the offence of manslaughter, which was left as an alternative, was clearly correct.  
      
       
     47 That intoxication has no relevance in relation to the test for dangerousness of the act (or omission), which is an element of the offence of manslaughter, is also made clear by s 428F of the Act, which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         428F. 
          If, for the purposes of determining whether a person is guilty of an offence, it is necessary to compare the state of mind of the person with that of a reasonable person, the comparison is to be made between the conduct or state of mind of the person and that of a reasonable person who is not intoxicated. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     48 Similarly it is made clear by Part 11A that, for neither murder or manslaughter, is self induced intoxication relevant in relation to the voluntariness of the act (or omission) which is charged as giving rise to the offence. In that regard, s 428G provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         428G.  
         (1) In determining whether a person has committed an offence, evidence of self-induced intoxication cannot be taken into account in determining whether the relevant conduct was voluntary. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) However, a person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the relevant conduct resulted from intoxication that was not self-induced.” 
         
        
       
     49 It may be noted that, in relation to the mens rea required for offences other than those of specific intent, s 428D provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         428D.  
         In determining whether a person had the mens rea for an offence other than an offence of specific intent, evidence that a person was intoxicated at the time of the relevant conduct: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) if the intoxication was self-induced – cannot be taken into account, 
          
         or 
          
         (b) if the intoxication was not self-induced – may be taken into account. 
         ” 
          
         
        
       
     50 Finally, it is to be noted that s 428H provides that: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The Common law relating to the effect of intoxication on criminal liability is abolished 
         .” 
         
        
       
     51 In the first way in which the appellant put his case, reliance was placed upon the simple fact that murder was included within the offences referred to in part (a) of the Table to s 428B(2), as an example of an offence of specific intent, without any qualification as to any of the forms or ways in which that offence may be committed. 
      
       
     52 That submission has some force when regard is had to the circumstance that murder was included in part (a), and not as one of the part (b) offences, which are similarly listed in the table, as examples of offences of specific intent, but which are included only “to the extent that an element of the offence requires a person to intend to cause the specific result necessary for the offence”. 
      
       
     53 On the other hand, the primary definition is contained in s 428B(1), which defines an offence of specific intent as “one of which an intention to cause a specific result is an element”; whereas s 428B(2) is, on its face, a provision which gives examples of such an offence “without limiting the generality” of the s 428B(1) definition.  
      
       
     54 The alternative or supplementary submission turns upon the proposition that, under the pre-existing law, no relevant distinction was made in this State in relation to the effects of intoxication upon the state of mind required for murder by reckless indifference. So it was observed in R v Stones (1956) 56 SR (NSW) 25 at 34, in relation to the state of mind of the accused, that: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         If he applied his mind to the consequences, and without concluding that they would probably happen (which is criminal intent) his state of mind was that he did not care whether they happened or not, that is recklessness. The task of a jury is to infer to what extent the accused appreciated the consequences of his act. It seems to us that to be recklessly indifferent to human life, as stated in s 18, the state of mind of the accused is relevant and requires proof of a high degree of malice in the doer, going beyond mere negligence or a dangerous act, unless in the latter case, the act is one of violence, e.g. rape, which comes within the latter part of s. 18(1)(a) which, if death ensues, necessarily constitutes a malicious homicide. Drunkenness of a high degree, therefore, may in rare cases operate to rebut reckless indifference to human life, although as the onus is on the prosecution, it is not strictly speaking a rebuttal 
         , but as it involves a state of mind, it becomes relevant in the same way as in the specific intent cases. We think also a practical result is thus achieved, for otherwise directions which a trial judge would be bound to give a jury would become unnecessarily complex and difficult for laymen to understand if a distinction was to be drawn, in cases where drunkenness was raised, between malice inferred from intent on the one hand and constructive malice to be inferred from a reckless indifference to consequences on the other 
         . 
         ” (Emphasis added). 
         
        
       
     55 This passage provides some support for adopting a parity of approach for cases dependant respectively upon malice inferred from intent, and upon malice inferred from reckless indifference. That relates to the fact that the mental state required, in each instance, goes beyond that involved in basic intent, as well as to the fact that jurors may have considerable difficulty, if required to differentiate in relation to the effects of intoxication in cases where both forms of murder are left – as occurred in the present case. 
      
       
     56 It should be observed, additionally, that the problem identified is not confined to murder by reckless indifference. A similar problem can arise in relation to felony murder, as is indicated by a consideration of the circumstances in which it can arise. 
      
       
     57 For that form of murder, there is similarly no requirement for the Crown to prove that the accused intended to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. What is required is that: 
      
       
        
       (a) the accused had the basic intent to commit the act which caused death; 
        
       (b) such act was done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission by the accused (or some accomplice) of “ 
       a crime which is itself punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years 
       ”; and that 
        
       (c) the accused had the mens rea required for an attempt to commit such other crime, or for the crime itself. 
       
     58 There are very many “crimes” which are punishable under the Crimes Act (NSW), by imprisonment for life or for 25 years. For convenience a table of such offences is attached by way of an annexure to these reasons. While most of them are themselves crimes of specific intent, not all of them are. Some, for example s 32 (impeding endeavours to escape a shipwreck), s 46 (causing bodily injury by gunpowder etc) and s 204(b) (destruction of or damage to an aircraft or vessel) are made out by proof that the accused acted “maliciously”, or with “reckless indifference”. The Crimes Act provides, in relation to the definition of an act “done maliciously” that:  
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         5 Maliciously 
         : Every act done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, or done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure some person or persons, or corporate body, in property or otherwise, and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and of every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient in the crime.” 
         
        
       
     59 Neither s 32 or s 46 are mentioned in part (a) or (b) of the table to s 428B(2), but s 204 is, however, included in part (b) of that table.  
      
       
     60 As was made clear in R v Stones (1956) 56 SR (NSW) 25 and R v Cunningham (1957) 2 QB 396, and, as s 5 of the Crimes Act also makes clear, crimes of malice require either intention or recklessness, each of which calls for a foresight of the consequences, in addition to the mental element required for basic intent. 
      
       
     61 The interpretation advanced by the Crown upon appeal would exclude some, but not all, forms of felony murder as offences of specific intent and would accordingly introduce another possible area of complexity in the directions which might, potentially, need to be given to a jury.  
      
       
     62 The issue before the Court comes down essentially to the question whether, as a matter of construction, bearing in mind the background to the amending legislation, murder, in all its forms, including cases of reckless indifference, and of felony murder, are to be regarded as coming within the operation of s 428B(1) and s 428C. 
      
       
     63 In support of the proposition that this question should be answered in the affirmative, counsel for the appellant placed some reliance upon the passage in Crabbe v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 464, where the Court said (at 469): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         … on one view, a person who does an act knowing its probable consequences may be regarded as having intended those consequences to occur 
         ”. 
         
        
       
     64 That observation no doubt reflected the much criticised, although often quoted presumption of fact that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts (for a criticism of its use see Smyth v The Queen (1957) 98 CLR 163, and Stapleton v The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 365. 
      
       
     65 In He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 527, Brennan J, after noting the distinction in mental states between voluntariness and general (basic) intent, and between general and specific intent, made reference to this passage, in the course of observing at p 570: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Both general intent and specific intent may be established by knowledge: the former by knowledge of the circumstances which give the act its character, the latter by knowledge of the probability of the occurrence of the result to which the intent is expressed to relate. But existing circumstances can be known more certainly than the probability of the occurrence of a future result, and therefore specific intent is usually established by proof of a desire or wish to cause the prescribed result, whereas general intent is usually established by proof of knowledge of circumstances prescribed by the statute as defining the act involved in the commission of the offence. Of course, proof of an actual desire or wish to do an act of the prescribed character is proof of general intent (cf Reynhoudt (1962) 107 CLR 381 at 398-399; Morgan at 210), but for practical purposes knowledge of the circumstances which give the act its character when an act is voluntarily done is the ordinary form of an intent to do it.  
         A specific intent to cause a prescribed result can be, but is not ordinarily, established by knowledge that such a result will probably (or is likely to) occur:  
         Crabbe (1985) 59 ALJR 417. Just as knowledge of the probable (or likely) results of an act establishes a specific intent to cause those results, so the doing of an act with knowledge that he circumstances are probably such as to make the act criminal establishes a general intent to do an act of that character.”  
         (Emphasis added). 
         
        
       
     66 These passages, and particularly that in He Kaw Teh, do need to be understood in their context. It is the case that a relevant state of mind, such as knowledge, or specific intent, can be inferred from conduct, or from the circumstances in which an act is done: see The Queen v Pereira (1988) 35 A Crim R 382 at 385. It does not, however, follow that intent and knowledge are synonymous, or equivalent states of mind for all purposes. 
      
       
     67 While the purposive rule of interpretation is embodied in s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) and the provision contained in s 428H of the Crimes Act must be given full effect, so must the presumption that a beneficial interpretation is to be given to criminal legislation, when there is an ambiguity: R v Morgan (1993) 67 A Crim R 526 at 534 per Mahoney JA. Additionally, it is appropriate to have regard to the history of the development of the relevant law and the source from which the amending legislation was derived, here the decision in Regina v Majewski (1977) AC 443.  
      
       
     68 The justification for the creation of a distinction in relation to the offence of murder, between cases of specific intent, on the one hand, and reckless indifference, on the other hand, so far as the effects of intoxication are concerned, is not easy to see, and was not directly addressed in Regina v Majewski. So far as the House of Lords there dealt with the offence of murder, it was in the context of an offence charging an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. To that decision I will however return, since it needs to be understood in its historical context, and in the light of the policy considerations which appear to have prevailed over the illogicality in the development of the law which some of the Law Lords noted.  
      
       
     69 As Underwood J (as he then was) observed in Attorney-General’s Reference No 1 of 1996: re Weiderman (1998) 7 Tas R 293 at 308-309, a code case which accordingly raised somewhat different considerations in relation the question there referred to the court: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         In early times, drunkenness was a circumstance of aggravation, not an excuse for criminal conduct. This attitude gradually ameliorated over the years so that drunkenness was neither a circumstance of aggravation nor amelioration until the mid 19th Century when there began to emerge in the common law a doctrine that drink might be pleaded in mitigation; but the limits of the doctrine were far from clear until R v Meade [1909] 1 KB 895 and a decade later, Beard [Director of Public Prosecutions v Beard (1920) AC 479]. In the latter case, Lord Birkenhead stated these conclusions at 501-502: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           “ 
           2 That evidence of drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts proved in order to determine whether or not he had this intent. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           3 That evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.”” 
           
          
         
        
       
     70 As Wright J also noted in Weiderman, at 316: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Although Beard deals with intent and not with knowledge, it seems to me that the basic legal policy (there) acknowledged…should apply to all situations…where a subjective mental element is an ingredient of the crime alleged.” 
         
        
       
     71 It may be noted that, at common law, knowledge was not an ingredient of the crime of murder: R v Moloney (1985) AC 905; and additionally, that Beard was rejected by the High Court in O’Connor v The Queen as stating the common law in Australia, particularly so far as the test was stated in terms of the capability of the accused forming intent.  
      
       
     72 The form of the offence, which involves reckless indifference to human life, has been regarded in this country as no less heinous than that which arises out of intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. In Boughey v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 10 (albeit a code case in which murder is defined in a significantly different way), Brennan J said (at 43): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Although we have accepted in this country that an intention to kill is not necessarily the same mental state as knowledge that death will probably result, we have regarded the two mental states as comparable in heinousness. We have understood that to be the orthodox view of the common law. 
         ” 
         
        
        
         
        
       His Honour continued: 
        
        
         
         “ 
         In England, where the House of Lords has been astute to ensure that the doctrine of Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith [1961] AC 290 should not be revived in a new garb, their Lordships have relegated knowledge of the probability of death to the field of evidence, treating it merely as a foundation for an inference of an intention to cause death. In R v Hancock [1986] AC 455, at p 472, Lord Scarman noted that in R v Moloney [1985] AC 905, the House of Lords had ‘made it absolutely clear that foresight of consequences is no more than evidence of the existence of the intent; it must be considered, and its weight assessed, together with all the evidence in the case. Foresight does not necessarily imply the existence of intention, though it may be a fact from which when considered with all the other evidence a jury may think it right to infer the necessary intent.’ In this country we have followed a different path by declining to follow R v Smith and by acknowledging the separate mental states of intent and knowledge of likely consequences. But the notion which underlies both the judgment of this Court in Crabbe (1985) 156 CLR 464 and the speeches in Moloney and Hancock is that that the mental state which is necessary to establish the crime of murder when the accused does not actually wish that death should result from what he does is knowledge (or foresight) that that result is so probable or likely that the doing of the fatal act is as heinous as if the accused had wished that result. In either case the accused compasses the death of the person killed or of some other person. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     73 The absence of any logical basis for arbitrarily differentiating between the various forms of murder in terms of their seriousness, or between the public policy interests which make them punishable in accordance with s 19A of the Crimes Act, also has support in sentencing decisions such as Regina v Mills NSWCCA, 3 April 1995, Regina v JB and RJH (1999) NSWCCA 93 (in relation to felony murder); and Regina v Ainsworth (1994) 76 A Crim R 127, and Regina v Aiton  (1993) 68 A Crim R 578 (in relation to reckless indifference). 
      
       
     74 As I have observed, the decision in Director of Public Prosecutions v Majewski (1977) AC 443, which was expressly not followed in O’Connor v The Queen, became the source for Part 11A. It was a case concerned with charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault on a police officer in the execution of his duty. The defence of the accused was that the offences had been committed while he was suffering from the effects of alcohol and drugs. The question of law certified for the House of Lords was “whether a defendant may properly be convicted of assault notwithstanding that, by reason of his self-induced intoxication, he did not intend to do the act alleged to constitute the assault”. That question was answered by all of the Law Lords, who sat on the appeal, in the affirmative. 
      
       
     75 The argument focussed upon the question whether the rule at common law, that self induced intoxication was not a defence, although mitigated for offences where special intent had to be proved, was still an effective rule. In the course of considering that question, considerable attention was given to the judgment of Lord Birkenhead LC with whom the other members of the Appellate Committee had agreed, in Director of Public Prosecutions v Beard (1920) AC 479, and, in particular, to the passage at p 504, which some commentators have suggested was contradictory of the primary thesis advanced by His Lordship as being confirmatory of the continued existence of the rule.  
      
       
     76 Consideration was also given to the logical and ethical basis for the distinction, which had been accepted between cases of specific and general intent. That, similarly, was a matter which had attracted critical comment, and in some jurisdictions, of which Australia became one, after the law was declared in O’Connor v The Queen (and see earlier Regina v Keogh (1964) VR 400 and Regina v Haywood (1971) VR 755); Scotland was another (Regina v Winchester, 1955, Unreported, and Her Majesty’s Advocate v Kinnison [1870] 1 Coup 457; as was New Zealand (Regina v Kamipeli, unreported). 
      
       
     77 That the offence of assault is to be considered as an offence of basic intent, even though the striking is done with hostile intention, was seen by Lord Elwyn-Davies LC (at 471) and by Lord Edmund-Davies (at 487), to have support in the observations of Lord Simon of Glaisdale in Regina v Morgan [1976] AC 182 at 216: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         By ‘crimes of basic intent’ I mean those crimes whose definition expresses (or, more often, implies) a mens rea which does not go beyond the actus reus. The actus reus generally consists of an act and some consequence. The consequence may be very closely connected with the act or more remotely connected with it: but with a crime of basic intent the mens rea does not extend beyond the act and its consequence, however, remote, as defined in the actus reus. I take assault as an example of a crime of basic intent where the consequence is very closely connected with the act. The actus reus of assault is an act which causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. The mens rea corresponds exactly. The prosecution must prove that the accused foresaw that his act would probably cause another person to have apprehension of immediate and unlawful violence, or would possibly have that consequence, such being the purpose of the act, or that he was reckless as to whether or not his act caused such apprehension. This foresight (the term of art is ‘intention’) or recklessness is the mens rea in assault.” 
         
        
       
     78 The much cited passage in the speech of Lord Birkenhead LC (at 504), was to the effect that the course of decisions had established that: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         where a specific intent is an essential element in the offence, evidence of a state of drunkenness rendering the accused incapable of forming such an intent should be taken into consideration in order to determine whether he had in fact formed the intent necessary to constitute the particular crime. If he was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent required he could not be convicted of a crime which was committed only If the intent was proved. … In a charge of murder based upon intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm, if the jury are satisfied that the accused was, by reason of his drunken condition, incapable of forming the intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm…he cannot be convicted of murder. But nevertheless unlawful homicide has been committed by the accused, and consequently he is guilty of unlawful homicide  
         without malice afterthought 
         , and that is manslaughter: per Stephen J. in Reg. V. Doherty (1887) 16 Cox C.C. 306, 307.”  
         (Emphasis added). 
         
        
       
     79 Thereafter his Lordship added, in a passage which has attracted judicial and academic comment, and a degree of puzzlement: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         I do not think that that the proposition of law deduced from these earlier cases is an exceptional rule applicable only to cases in which it is necessary to prove a specific intent in order to constitute the graver crime – e.g., wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm or with intent to kill. It is true that in such cases the specific intent must be proved to constitute the particular crime, but this is, on ultimate analysis, only in accordance with the ordinary law applicable to crime, for, speaking generally (and apart from certain special offences), a person cannot be convicted of a crime unless the mens was rea. Drunkenness, rendering a person incapable of the intent, would be an answer, as it is for example in a charge of attempted suicide.” 
         
        
       
     80 This passage was regarded as explicable by Lord Salmon (at 483), upon the basis that all His Lordship was intending to do was to “point out that drunkenness was relevant to all cases in which it was necessary to prove a specific intent or was not confined to those cases in which, if the prosecution failed to prove such an intent, the accused could still be convicted of a lesser offence”. To similar effect were passages in the speeches of Lord Russell of Killowen (at 499), with which Lord Elwyn-Jones and Lord Diplock (at 473, 476) agreed. That the distinction between cases of general and specific intent was lacking in logic, was recognised, in particular, by Lord Solomon (at 482-483), by Lord Edmund-Davies by Lord Russell of Killowen (at 498), and in passing by Lord Elwyn Jones LC (at 469). Possibly, it was best articulated by Lord Salmon (at 482): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         As I understand it, the argument runs like this: Intention whether special or basic (or whatever fancy name you choose to give it) is still intention. If voluntary intoxication by drink or drugs can, as it admittedly can, negative the special or specific intention necessary for the commission of crimes such as murder and theft, how can you justify in strict logic the view that it cannot negative a basic intention, e.g., the intention to commit offences such as assault and unlawful wounding? The answer is that in strict logic this view cannot be justified. But this is the view that has been adopted by the common law of England, which is founded on common sense and experience rather than strict logic.” 
         
        
        
       
     81 The illogicality thus identified, was, in part, resolved by reference to the pragmatic approach which had been taken arising out of the harshness of the penalties of capital punishment or transportation, which attached to murder and to serious offences such as wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and by recognition of the sympathy attracted, for example, in cases of attempted suicide (per Lord Elwyn-Jones LC at 472 and Lord Salmon at 481). 
      
       
     82 Otherwise, it appears that justification for the distinction was seen in the long and uninterrupted course of precedent (per Lord Elwyn-Jones LC at 473, Lord Salmon at 482-483, Lord Edmund-Davies at 490-491), and in the policy which placed paramount weight on the protection of the public from violence attributable to self induced intoxication, particularly in the light of the recent increase, within the community, of the use of narcotic and hallucinatory drugs. 
      
       
     83 Lord Elwyn-Jones said, in this respect, at 474/5: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         I do not for my part regard that general principle as either unethical or contrary to the principles of natural justice. If a man of his own volition takes a substance which causes him to cast off the restraints of reason and conscience, no wrong is done to him by holding him answerable criminally for any injury he may do while in that condition. His course of conduct in reducing himself by drugs and drink to that condition in my view supplies the evidence of mens rea, of guilty mind certainly sufficient for crimes of basic intent. It is a reckless course of conduct and recklessness is enough to constitute the necessary mens rea in assault cases: see Reg. V. Venna [1976] Q.B. 421, per James L.J. at p. 429. The drunkenness is itself an intrinsic, an integral part of the crime, the other part being the evidence of the unlawful use of force against the victim. Together they add up to criminal recklessness.” 
         
        
       
     84 That approach, His Lordship considered to be : 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         in line with the American Model Penal Code (s. 2.08 ‘When recklessness establishes an element of the offence, if the act, or due to self-induced intoxication, is unaware of a risk of which he would have been aware had he been sober, such unawareness is immaterial’)”  
         (at 475).  
         
        
       
     85 To similar effect were the observations of Lord Simon of Glaisdale at (476, 477 and 478), but most particularly at 479-480 where His Lordship said: 
      
       
        
         
         “…  
         I do not in fact believe that the distinction drawn by Stephen J. and the Earl of Birkenhead L.C. between the effect of self-induced intoxication on crimes of basic intent, on the one hand, and on crimes of specific intent, on the other, is juristically unjustifiable and to be supported only on historical and practical grounds. 
         
        
        
         
         The concept of mens rea goes back to the Laws of Henry I and is clearly stated in its mature form in Coke. The argument for the appellant (that, if self-induced intoxication may negative specific intent, it must logically be capable of negativing basic intent) would mean that jurists from Coke to the Earl of Birkenhead L.C. (including Hale, Blackstone, and Stephen) not only formed a fallacious view of the law, but failed to recognise that there was even any problem posed by their formulation. So too, later, with Lord Denning. This seems to me inherently improbable. 
         
        
        
         
         As I have ventured to suggest, there is nothing unreasonable or illogical in the law holding that a mind rendered self-inducedly insensible (short of M’Naghten insanity), through drink or drugs, to the nature of a prohibited act or to its probable consequences is as wrongful a mind as one which consciously contemplates the prohibited act and foresees its probable consequences (or is reckless as to whether they ensue). The latter is all that is required by way of mens rea in a crime of basic intent. But a crime of specific intent requires something more than contemplation of the prohibited act and foresight of its probable consequences. The mens rea in a crime of specific intent requires proof of a purposive element.” 
         
        
       
     86 In even stronger terms Lord Salmon said (at 483): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         As I have already indicated, I accept that there is a degree of illogicality in the rule that intoxication may excuse or expunge one type of intention and not another. This illogicality is, however, acceptable to me because the benevolent part of the rule removes undue harshness without imperilling safety and the stricter part of the rule works without imperilling justice.” 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
          
         “ 
         Absolute logic in human affairs is an uncertain guide and a very dangerous master. The law is primarily concerned with human affairs. I believe that the main object of our legal system is to preserve individual liberty. One important aspect of individual liberty is protection against physical violence.  
         
        
        
         
         If there were to be no penal sanction for any injury unlawfully inflicted under the complete mastery of drink or drugs, voluntarily taken, the social consequence could be appalling.  
         (at 484). 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         If, as I think, this long standing rule was salutary years ago when it related almost exclusively to drunkenness and hallucinatory drugs were comparatively unknown, how much more salutary is it today when such drugs are increasingly becoming a public menace? My Lords, I am satisfied that this rule accords with justice, ethics and common sense, and I would leave it alone even if it does not comply with strict logic.”  
         (at 484). 
          
         
        
       
     87 Lord Edmund-Davies also noted the policy considerations which had led to the judiciary developing a “more sympathetic attitude toward the plea that the crime was committed under the influence of drink”, observing (at 488-489): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         So it was that in 1887 Stephen J. said (Reg. V. Doherty, 16 Cox C. C. 306, 308): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘A drunken man my form an intention to kill another, or to do grievous bodily harm to him, or he may not; but if he did form that intention, although a drunken intention, he is just as much guilty of murder as if he had been sober…; but if his drunkenness prevented his forming such an intention he would be guilty of manslaughter, and not murder, though such an act in a sober man would prove an intention to do grievous bodily harm.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         As professor Jerome Hall observed (General Principles of Criminal Law, 2nd ed. (1960), p. 544), it is easy to understand what led Stephen J. and judges before him to rely on specific intent, 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘ 
           as the most acceptable means of achieving mitigation and they formulated the rule which achieved a degree of exculpation upon it. Whatever the attitude in earlier years, in modern times it is commonly felt that an injury inflicted under gross intoxication ought to be distinguished from a similar injury committed by a sober person.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Nevertheless, the earlier attitude persisted to the extent that it was considered that complete exculpation of crimes committed under the influence even of gross intoxication could not be allowed. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘The rules on criminal intent lay closest at hand to suggest a plausible mediation. Most of the harms met in these cases were homicides and aggravated assaults, and here the accepted distinction concerning ‘general’ and ‘specific’ intent could operate to produce the desired end in England and a minority of States where the resulting liability of the homicide was manslaughter.’” 
           
          
         
        
       
     88 His Lordship returned to this consideration (at 495): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Illogical though the present law may be, it represents a compromise between the imposition of liability upon inebriates in complete disregard of their condition (on the alleged ground that it was brought on voluntarily), and the total exculpation required by the defendant’s actual state of mind at the time he committed the harm in issue. It is at this point pertinent to pause to consider why legal systems exist. The universal object of a system of law is obvious – the establishment and maintenance of order. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘the first aim of legal rules is to ensure that members of the community are safeguarded in their persons and property so that their energies are not exhausted by the business of self-protection.’” 
           
          
         
        
       
     89 He added (at 496): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The merciful relaxation of the old rule that drunkenness was no defence appears to have worked reasonably well for 150 years. As to the complaint that it is unethical to punish a man for a crime when his physical behaviour was not controlled by a conscious mind, I have long regarded as a convincing theory in support of penal liability of harms committed by voluntary inebriates, the view of Austin, who argued (Lectures on Jurisprudence, 1879, pp. 512-513) that a person who voluntarily became intoxicated is to be regarded as acting recklessly, for he made himself dangerous in disregard of public safety.  
         
        
        
         
         But, to my way of thinking, the nearest approach to a satisfactory refutation of charges of lack of both logic and ethics in punishing the most drunken man for actions which, were he sober, would call for his criminal conviction is that of Stroud, who wrote (Mens Rea (1914), p. 115): 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         … drunkenness is not incompatible with mens rea, in the sense of ordinary culpable intentionality, because mere recklessness is sufficient to satisfy the definition of mens rea, and drunkenness is itself an act of recklessness. The law therefore establishes a conclusive presumption against the admission of proof of intoxication for the purpose of disproving mens rea in ordinary crimes. Where this presumption applies, it does not make ‘drunkenness itself’ a crime, but the drunkenness is itself an integral part of the crime, as forming, together with the other unlawful conduct charged against the defendant, a complex act of criminal recklessness. This explanation affords at once a justification of the rule of law, and a reason for its inapplicability when drunkenness is pleaded by way of showing absence of full intent, or of some exceptional form of mens rea essential to a particular crime, according to its definition.” 
         
        
       
     90 And, (at 497): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         .. in my judgment little can properly be made out of the criticisms that a law which demands the conviction of such persons who behave as the appellant did is both illogical and unethical. It may be that Parliament should look at it, and devise a new way of dealing with drunken or drugged offenders. But, until it does, the continued application of the existing law is far better calculated to preserve order than the recommendation that he and all who act similarly should leave the dock as free men.” 
         
        
       
     91 The importance of preserving public order was also a theme taken up by Lord Russell of Killowen, who said (at 498): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         A man who has no knowledge of what he does cannot, it is said, be a guilty man, whatever may have deprived him of that knowledge. There is, at least superficially, logic in that approach: but logic in criminal law must not be allowed to run away with common sense, particularly when the preservation of the Queen’s Peace is in question. The ordinary citizen who is badly beaten up would rightly think little of the criminal law as an effective protection if, because his attacker had deprived himself of ability to know what he was doing by getting himself drunk or going on a trip with drugs, the attacker is to be held innocent of any crime in the assault. Mens rea has many aspects. If asked to define it in such a case as the present I would say that the element of guilt or moral turpitude is supplied by the act of self-intoxication reckless of possible consequences 
         ”.  
         
        
       
     92 Of somewhat more direct relevance to the present appeal is the observation of Lord Russell of Killowen, in relation to the second aspect of Lord Birkenhead’s speech in Beard (a case of murder consequent upon , or in the course of, a rape) which has similarly attracted critical attention, so far as the Lord Chancellor there appeared to have suggested (at 504 and 507) that “the charges would not have been made good had the accused been too drunk to form the intent of committing rape”. Lord Russell said in this regard (at 500): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         In my opinion these passages do not indicate an opinion that rape is a crime of special intent. All that is meant is that conscious rape is required to supply ‘the felonious intent which murder involves.’ For the crime of murder special or particular intent is always required for the necessary malice aforethought. This may be intent to kill or intent to cause grievous bodily harm: or in a case such as Beard of constructive malice, this required the special intent consciously to commit the violent felony of rape in the course and furtherance of which the act of violence causing death took place. Beard, therefore, in my opinion does not suggest that rape is a crime of special or particular intent.” 
         
        
       
     93 The decision in Majewski, which was not regarded with favour in O’Connor, but which now has immediate relevance since it was the source of the amending legislation, is, in many ways, troubling. It accepts the existence of an illogicality, in legal principle, in drawing a distinction between offences of general and specific intent, so far as the effects of intoxication are concerned. In relation to reckless indifference there is a significant element of intent involved in a state of mind which requires first an awareness or foresight that the probable consequence of one’s act is death, and secondly a conscious decision to proceed regardless. Why that should be regarded as significantly different, or less deserving of punishment, than an act which is done with intent to cause serious bodily harm, but which results in death, is clearly debatable.  
      
       
     94 The preservation of that illogical distinction appears to have been justified in Majewski out of respect for long established precedent, and by reference to the public interest in ensuring that those who commit criminal offences under the influence of alcohol or drugs, do not go unpunished. For murder, and for more serious wounding offences involving special intent, it appears to have been of some relevance that an accused would remain criminally responsible for some lesser offence of basic intent, in the event of the effects of intoxication being permissibly taken into account as negating specific intent, where that is an essential element of the more serious charge.  
      
       
     95 There is at least a hint, in the concluding passage in the speech of Lord Russell, that there may be offences involving special malice aforethought, for which the effects of self induced intoxication remain relevant. In that regard, a distinction may properly be recognised between recklessness where a person does not apply his or her mind at all before undertaking an act, and where that person does apply his or her mind, and foreseeing the specific risk involved, nevertheless goes ahead regardless of it.  
      
       
     96 So understood, as the source for the amending legislation, I do not consider that Majewski necessarily calls for the narrow interpretation pressed by the Crown, which would call for a distributive application of s 428C in relation to the various forms of malice aforethought, or constructive malice, required for murder. Particularly is that so when it is recalled that, for manslaughter self induced intoxication provides no defence, a proposition for which there is long standing precedent: Regina v Doherty 16 Cox C.C. 306., and that Lord Birkenhead’s test was specifically phrased in terms of crimes calling for “malice afterthought”.  
      
       
     97 Bearing in mind the existence of the express provision (s 428E) relating to the offence of manslaughter, which prevents an accused, whose intoxication is self induced, from escaping criminal responsibility (as might formerly have occurred), the potential complexity for a jury where a case is left upon the alternative bases of specific intent, and reckless indifference and/or manslaughter, the comparable degree of heinousness which attaches to murder however committed, the nature of the malice aforethought involved, and the terms in which s 428B(2) is framed, I have reached the conclusion that the legislature should be taken as having intended that murder, in all of its forms, should come within the operation of s 428C. Had it been intended to apply a distributive effect to it, so that s 428C was applicable only to murder dependent upon intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, then it might have been expected that it would have been included in part (b) of the table to s 428B(2), rather than in part(a).  
      
       
     98 For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the jury were misdirected in relation to the relevance of intoxication for the charge of murder, so far as the Crown relied upon reckless indifference. 
      
       
     99 I would accordingly propose that the appeal be allowed in relation to Ground 1, with the consequence that the conviction and sentence for the count of murder should be quashed and a new trial ordered.  
      
       
        
       Appeal Against Conviction for Shooting with Intent to Murder 
        
       
     100 It was submitted by the appellant that there was insufficient evidence to prove that a shot had been fired by the appellant at Mr Bradford, with the intention of killing him. 
      
       
     101 This ground of appeal accordingly focuses upon s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), in particular upon the question whether there was a miscarriage of justice in that the jury verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. 
      
       
     102 As has been established in M v The Queen (1993) 181 CLR 487 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 72 ALJR 78, the Court must undertake an independent examination of the relevant evidence to determine the answer to the question, which has been formulated, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Could it be said that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt, so as to support the quashing of the conviction and the entry of a verdict of acquittal?” 
         :  
         Regina v Giam  
         (1999) NSWCCA 53 and  
         Fleming v The Queen  
         (1998) 158 ALR 379. 
         
        
       
     103 In addressing this question it is proper that the Court accept that any doubt, which it might experience, after reading the transcript, may be resolved by the fact that the jury was better placed than it, in having had the advantage of seeing and hearing the relevant witnesses give their evidence: M v The Queen at 494 and Mackenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 365 to 368. 
      
       
     104 It is necessary to return, in a little more detail, to the evidence in the trial concerning the second shooting. 
      
       
     105 The shooter, who was identified as the appellant, was seen by Mr Leeder, as he walked across the car park, carrying a rifle, towards Allen Hobden’s Nissan utility, at the rear of which he (Mr Leeder), Mr Shersingh and Mr Bradford were standing. Mr Leeder said, upon realising that the appellant was carrying a rifle, that he crouched down on the passenger side. The appellant, he said, approached the vehicle on the roadway and stopped in front of it. Mr Shersingh, he said, was standing at the rear of the Nissan on the driver’s side when he was shot.  
      
       
     106 On the driver’s side of the vehicle he said there was parked a Mercedes Benz sedan. On the other side (that is, the passenger’s side of the Nissan), there was a four wheel drive vehicle, which appeared to have been the Jeep Cherokee owned by Mr and Mrs Tishler. 
      
       
     107 After the shot was fired which hit the deceased, Mr Leeder said that he rolled under the four wheel drive vehicle, and then ran off towards the area where a party was underway, in order to get help. As he ran he heard a second shot. At that time he saw Mr Shersingh making his way back towards the hotel, where he later collapsed. 
      
       
     108 Mr Bradford similarly said that he and Mr Leeder were standing at the rear of the Nissan utility, on the passenger’s side, with Mr Shersingh on the driver’s side. He first saw the appellant about 30 feet away heading for the utility from in front of it. At a distance of about 20 feet away the appellant, he said, fired a shot which hit Mr Shersingh. 
      
       
     109 After this shot he saw that the appellant was pointing the rifle at him. He then began running and ducking along the side of the vehicle until such time as he was able to make good his escape over to the bottle shop. At one stage he said that the appellant was “chasing [him] around the ute”. He acknowledged, in cross-examination, that he was in shock and did not know whether he ran around the vehicle or not, although he added: “I was running all over the place”. He did not remember hearing a second shot, or being on the driver’s side of the vehicle while he was being chased. In an initial statement to police he had placed himself on that side, but he had subsequently corrected that statement, so as to place himself on the other side.  
      
       
     110 A small portion of lead material, which appeared to be the remains of a projectile, and a small projectile hole were found in the rear passenger side of the Mercedes Sedan. The projectile remains were not suitable for comparison purposes due to their damaged condition. The owner of the vehicle, Mr Middleton, however, said that he had not seen the bullet hole in the vehicle before this night.  
      
       
     111 It was the Crown case that this bullet was fired at Mr Bradford, a fact that depended upon him having been pursued around to the driver’s side of the utility, and the shot having been fired from the passenger’s side. It is accordingly necessary to look at any other evidence which was directed to the relative positions of the shooter and Mr Bradford. 
      
       
     112 Peter Riley gave evidence of hearing a shot and seeing a man walking from the public car park. He then looked over into the car park and saw a man standing near a Nissan utility on the passenger’s side. The man who he first saw, he said, came back a few seconds later and started chasing the man, who had been standing near the utility, and who had short blonde hair (as had Mr Bradford) around it once or twice. That second man, he said, appeared to be dodging something, adding “every time the other man came around one side he would go the opposite way trying to keep out of the way”. The pursuer, he said, had something like a bar in his hand, which he raised while standing next to the tray on the passenger’s side of the utility. After that happened he heard a crack. The man who was on the other side of the utility dodged behind the cab. The man with the bar then walked off into the shadows and caravan park. In cross-examination he made it clear that the two men kept changing sides as the man with the bar was “chasing him”, indicating with his hands circular and semi circular movements.  
      
       
     113 Phillip Riley gave evidence of looking out from the caravan, where he was seated, after hearing a gunshot. He said that he saw a “bloke dodging around” a utility, a manoeuvre which he described as “moving around from the back to the passenger side and back again”, and as “dodging and trying to crouch down a bit”. While this was happening he said that he heard another shot, at a time when the person who was doing the dodging, was towards the back of the truck.  
      
       
     114 There was also evidence from police witnesses, particularly from Detective Senior Sergeant Hobson and Senior Constable Buining as to the existence of a series of scuff marks in the soil around the Nissan utility which were described as being “consistent with running and stop-start motions”. Detective Senior Sergeant Hobson gave evidence of finding a .22 calibre fired cartridge case under the front driver’s side of the utility. Its location was equivocal since it may have been the casing for the first shot, or it could have been ejected at some time after the first shot, or even kicked into the position where it was found by any one of the several persons who went to the area after the shooting. The hole in the rear passenger’s side door of the Mercedes Benz, Detective Senior Sergeant Hobson said, was of similar appearance to that attributable to a .22 calibre bullet, and the lead fragment, he also said, was of similar appearance to a .22 calibre projectile. He also described the subsequent finding, of a fired cartridge case in a pocket of the jacket taken from the deceased. 
      
       
     115 The ballistics, and firearm discharge residue tests, in relation to the hands of the appellant, the residue found on his jacket, the .22 fired cartridge cases found under the Nissan utility and in the pocket of the appellant’s jacket, the impact damaged projectile recovered from the body of the deceased, the damaged projectile recovered from the Mercedes sedan, and the Vostok .22 calibre long rifle and the shortened Lithgow single shot .22 calibre rifle recovered from the appellant’s caravan, revealed that : 
      
       
        
       (a) the projectile recovered from the deceased, and the .22 fired cartridge case found under the Nissan utility were shown to have matching characteristics with test fired cartridges from the appellant’s long rifle; 
        
       (b) the projectile recovered from the Mercedes sedan could not be used for comparison purposes by reason of its damaged state; 
        
       (c) the scrapings taken from the fired cartridge cases each included lead, barium and silicon, but could not be directly linked to the gunshot residue particles found on the jacket, although in one case there might have been a possibility of a link; 
        
       (d) the fired cartridge case taken from the jacket was excluded, by reason of class characteristics, from having been fired by the appellant’s Vostok long rifle; and while it displayed similar class characteristics to cartridge cases test fired by the shortened Lithgow rifle, there was otherwise insufficient detail for a positive identification. 
        
       
     116 Firearm discharge residue was not discovered on the hands of the appellant, although before samples were taken he had been allowed to wash his hands, preparatory to fingerprints being taken. Moreover, the shooting had occurred more than 8 hours before Detective Senior Sergeant Hobson was able to conduct the gunshot residue examination of his hands. 
      
       
     117 There was evidence from Detective Senior Constable Elkins that each of the long and short rifles found under the doona in the appellant’s caravan had a round chambered. The bolt action was open in each weapon. There were a number of .22 calibre rounds found in the caravan, on the bench adjacent to the entrance door; similar ammunition was found in a black bag in the annexe.  
      
       
     118 The evidence given by the witnesses was summarised in considerable detail by his Honour, in the course of which the jury’s attention was directly and carefully focused upon the significance of the respective positions of the appellant and Mr Bradford, in relation to the Nissan utility, and the Mercedes. 
      
       
     119 The issue which arose as to whether the weapon had been pointed and discharged at Mr Bradford from the passenger’s side of the Nissan, across that vehicle in the direction of the Mercedes Benz, was clearly articulated on more than one occasion. His Honour made it clear that, in order to convict on this count, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the second shot was fired at Mr Bradford, with intent to kill him.  
      
       
     120 In determining that issue, it was important that Mr Bradford had a distinct recollection of the appellant pursuing him and pointing the gun at him. It was also important that, while Mr Bradford could not remember, in his understandable state of shock, running around to the drivers side of the utility, Peter Riley, who was observing the scene from a position of safety, described the shooter as chasing the blond headed man, who must have been Mr Bradford, around the vehicle, in the clockwise and anticlockwise directions which he indicated. He also made it clear that he saw the shooter on the passenger side of the utility, from which position, he said, a shot was fired at the man on the opposite side of the vehicle.  
      
       
     121 The firing of a shot, in the circumstances described by those witnesses, where the weapon had been pointed at Mr Bradford, where he was being pursued, and where he was ducking and weaving and crouching down, was in my view properly capable of supporting the jury verdict. 
      
       
     122 So far as there may have been any imprecision or uncertainty in Mr Bradford’s evidence, or any inconsistency between his evidence and that of Mr Riley, that was quintessentially a matter for the jury to determine, with the benefit of having seen and heard each witness. In resolving any question which arose, the jury were also entitled to take into account the conduct of the appellant preceding the firing of the second shot, as well as the evidence of Constable Larkin, as to the contemporaneous statement of Mr Bradford made to her that night, to the effect: “he pointed a gun at me. I ran around the car and he missed me.” 
      
       
     123 The absence of a match between the cartridge case found in the jacket of the appellant and the long rifle is not fatal to the Crown case. Two possibilities remain open: first, that the second shot was fired from the shortened rifle; and secondly, that the cartridge case for the second shot was ejected at some point away from the scene and never found. Of more direct relevance is the fact that two shots were fired in close proximity, by a man who was positively identified as the appellant, who was seen to have fired the shot which struck Mr Shersingh, and who was then seen to pursue Mr Bradford, and to fire another shot while the latter was taking action to get away from him.  
      
       
     124 That there were two shots fired is beyond doubt. The Mercedes Benz had not been struck by a bullet previously to this night, and the damage to it could not be explained by the bullet which was fired at Mr Shersingh, since it was recovered from his body. 
      
       
     125 There was clear evidence of identification of the appellant as the shooter by two men who already knew and recognised him. Moreover, his account of the weapon having been borrowed by two men, who none of the many witnesses called had seen, or even heard of, and then having been mysteriously returned to the caravan, without him noticing, bordered on the absurd. 
      
       
     126 I am not persuaded that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, this ground has not been made good. I would dismiss the appeal against conviction in relation to the second count.  
      
       
        
       Proviso in Relation to Ground 1  
        
       
     127 By reason of the conclusion which I have reached in relation to the second count, it is necessary to return to Count 1, in order to determine whether the case is one to which the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act should apply. That arises by reason of the consideration that the jury must have rejected intoxication in relation to the state of mind required for Count 2, giving rise to the question whether a similar view would have been taken in relation to the first count, so far as it depends upon reckless indifference.  
      
       
     128 While the jury were directed to take intoxication into account in relation to the second count, in determining whether the appellant had, at the time when the shot was fired at Mr Bradford, the intent to kill him, it does not automatically follow that its findings in relation to that count should be carried over to the first count. The appellant was entitled to have the matter of intoxication correctly and separately left in relation to each count. The case is not one which calls for an application of the proviso. 
      
       
        
       Sentence  
        
       
     129 Since I am of the view that the appeal should be upheld in relation to Count 1, but dismissed in relation to Count 2, it is necessary to consider the sentence imposed for that count. That arises by reason of the circumstance that the appellant was sentenced, in respect of Count 2, to a fixed term, no doubt in recognition of the fact that it would be wholly absorbed in the sentence imposed for Count 1, which was partially cumulative upon it. His Honour, it may be assumed, in accordance with Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 fixed a sentence which he otherwise considered appropriate for Count 2, being one which would require a period of full time imprisonment of 5 years. That sentence has not been challenged as being too severe. 
      
       
        
       
     130 If the Court were now to set a non parole period in relation to this count, it would result in a sentence that was manifestly lenient for a serious offence of shooting with intent to murder. In these circumstances, and taking into consideration ss 44(1) and 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I would accordingly decline to now vary the sentence imposed by fixing a non parole period. 
      
       
     131 Accordingly, I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
     1. The appeal against conviction in respect of Count 1 be allowed;2. Conviction and sentence for Count 1 be quashed;3. A new trial be directed in relation to Count 1;4. The appeal against conviction and sentence in respect of Count 2 be dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 STEIN JA: The applicant, Terryl Lance-Joseph Woolery, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him by Freeman DCJ in the District Court on 29 June 2001. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 ½ years with a non-parole period of 4 ½ years, each to date from his arrest on 17 November 2000.  
      
       
     2 The applicant had pleaded guilty to one count under s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) by the importation of a commercial quantity of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in powder form (commonly known as ecstasy or MDMA). The quantity (1570.2 grams) is in excess of three times the commercial quantity specified under the Customs Act. The powder, which was strapped to the applicant’s body when he was apprehended at Sydney airport on 17 November 2000, was calculated as being capable of producing 14,900 tablets of 30% purity with a potential street value of $745,000. 
      
       
     3 The applicant readily admitted that the packages contained ecstasy, and that he had obtained them in Amsterdam. He told Federal police that he was given money for his air ticket and told that he would be paid US$10,000 for delivering the drug in Australia. 
      
       
     4 The applicant pleaded guilty before the Local Court on 7 May 2001 and adhered to his plea before Judge Freeman on 29 June 2001. The Crown accepts that the applicant entered the plea of guilty at the earliest practical opportunity. 
      
       
     5 There are two grounds of appeal. First, that his Honour failed to properly characterise the applicant’s criminality. Second, that his Honour undervalued the applicant’s plea of guilty. 
      
       
        
       Characterisation of applicant’s criminality 
        
       
     6 I turn first to the contention that his Honour mischaracterised the criminality of the applicant. After discussing The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         What this prisoner did was effect an importation which, without him, would not have taken place, at least at that time. One may hypothesise that somebody else would have been found, some other time may have been the occasion but the fact is  
         that in terms of this importation he was the central character 
         . Without him and the drugs wrapped around his waist this substance would not have reached Australian shores on 17 November 2000. [My emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     7 His Honour continued, and I quote this because it is important for the purpose of understanding Freeman DCJ’s reasoning and also the way in which the applicant puts his case on appeal. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         I accept that there is no evidence that he was involved in manufacture or acquisition and that he was not likely to be involved in disseminating it, other than perhaps to a single collector in Australia, but I am concerned with the importation not the other elements which surround it both before and after the act of bringing it in. 
         
        
       
     8 On behalf of the applicant, Mr Boulten submits that his Honour erred in not taking into account the circumstances enumerated in that passage as mitigating factors.  
      
       
     9 I do not see that the judge’s remarks should be so understood. His Honour did not ignore the particular factors in coming to the sentence that he imposed on the applicant. In effect what his Honour did, in my view properly, was to dismiss those factors as aggravating features of the offence.  
      
       
     10 It is plain that his Honour was characterising the applicant’s role as a principal in the importation. His Honour accepted, as I have said, that the applicant was not involved in the manufacture or acquisition of the drug, nor likely to be involved in dissemination, except for the initial delivery in Australia.  
      
       
     11 It is submitted on behalf of the applicant that on the evidence the applicant had a limited role in the enterprise and was ‘merely a courier’. This, it was submitted, was the extent of his involvement. It follows, in the submission of Mr Boulten, that his Honour’s starting point of 15 years was too high and that the applicant was entitled to some reduction for being a mere courier. 
      
       
     12 In the sense that the applicant carried the goods to Australia, he was a courier. But this does not mean that he cannot also be a principal. Clearly he was a principal in the importation of the drug and his Honour was entitled to describe the applicant as ‘the central character’ in the importation. 
      
       
     13 His Honour’s approach is entirely consistent with Olbrich. Their Honours (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ) provided useful comment on the distinction between ‘couriers’ and ‘principals’ and what they had to say is I believe apposite to repeat here. 
      
       
     14 Their Honours said (at 279 – 280): 
      
       
        
         
         19. Sometimes, when drugs are imported into this country, more than one person connected with the importation of those drugs (or subsequent dealings with them) is prosecuted. Sometimes, those persons will be charged with different offences under the  
         Customs Act 
         . One may be charged with importing the drugs; others may be charged with conspiracy to import prohibited imports, or being knowingly concerned in the importation of such imports. If several of those persons are convicted of, or plead guilty to, the offences with which they are charged, it will, of course, be necessary to identify any feature that should lead to imposing a different sentence on one from that imposed on another. In that context, a distinction between “couriers” and “principals” may prove a useful shorthand description of different kinds of participation in a single enterprise. And it may be that in the circumstances of a particular case, different levels of culpability might be identified by adopting those terms. But this was not such a case. Further, it is always necessary, whether one or several offenders are to be dealt with in connection with a single importation of drugs, to bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. Characterising the offender as “courier” or a “principal” must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did. 
         
        
        
         
         20. There are, of course, cases in which only one offender is prosecuted but it is clear that the importation is part of a business venture that is organised hierarchically. In such a case a distinction between courier and principal might be useful to indicate where an offender fitted into the hierarchy of the organisation. And that, in turn, might assist in identifying the nature of that offender’s criminality. But there was no evidence, one way or the other, to suggest that this was such a case. There was nothing before the primary judge which revealed that the respondent was part of any business venture of that kind. All that was known was that the respondent asserted that he was to be paid $15,000 for importing the heroin. That is, the respondent asserted that the importation of such a large quantity of heroin was for his financial gain rather than for some other purpose such as his own use. 
         
        
        
         
         21. Whether others stood to gain from the respondent’s conduct does not, it seems to us, affect what sentence should have been passed on him. That depended on what  
         he  
         had done and who  
         he  
         was, not on what others may have hoped to gain from his activity. But even if this were thought to be a useful inquiry, it was one that could not be pursued in this matter because there was no evidence about it.  
         
        
       
     15 In my opinion no error has been demonstrated and this ground of appeal must fail. 
      
       
        
       Undervalue of plea of guilty 
        
       
     16 I turn therefore to the second ground of appeal, that his Honour undervalued the applicant’s plea of guilty. I have already noted that the applicant pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and his Honour found that he had shown contrition. However, Freeman DCJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         … I do not think his plea qualifies at anything like the top level of the scale between 10 and 25 per cent which Mr Webb suggests. He was after all caught absolutely red-handed. It is difficult to see how the Crown case can get much stronger but nonetheless he is entitled to 10 per cent or say 12 months in round terms of that sentence.  
         
        
       
     17 The sentencing judge also allowed the applicant a discount of 18 months for his assistance to the authorities. This meant that his Honour was giving a combined discount of 25% for the plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities. 
      
       
     18 On behalf of the applicant it is submitted that his Honour was in error in allowing only a 10% discount for the plea of guilty. This was at the bottom of the range for utilitarian value alone (R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383). Counsel also seeks to contrast the 10% discount with a 15% discount given by his Honour for the applicant’s assistance to the authorities. 
      
       
     19 Thomson and Houlton applies to State offences and not to Commonwealth offences. Further, as the High Court made clear in R v Wong and Leung (2001) 185 ALR 231, the promulgation of a guideline such as Thomson and Houlton would not be permissible for Commonwealth offences. 
      
       
     20 In my opinion, it cannot be said that the 10% discount allowed by his Honour for the guilty plea was inappropriate. The applicant pleaded guilty because he was caught red-handed with the drugs strapped to his body. He readily admitted his guilt and the sentencing judge was right to conclude that the Crown case was overwhelming.21 Looking at the sentence as a whole (including the 25% combined discount), it cannot be concluded that it is unreasonable, plainly unjust or manifestly excessive, nor was there any error of law. The sentence appears to be well within the range of penalties imposed for similar offences, see the Crown’s submissions on sentence before Freeman DCJ. I can see no error in his Honour’s sentencing discretion which would cause this court to intervene.  
      
       
     22 Leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal against sentence should be dismissed. 
      
       
     23 GREG JAMES J: I agree. 
      
       
     24 HOWIE J: I also agree.

     3 CARRUTHERS AJ: GMS appeals against his conviction at the Wollongong District Court on 26 October 2001 upon one count of sexual intercourse without consent pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 which offence carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. 
      
       
     4 The appellant was arraigned before his Honour Judge Goldring DCJ and a jury of twelve at the Wollongong District Court on 15 October 2001 upon an indictment which contained one count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, namely being in the company of PJK, pursuant to s 61IJ(1), (2)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900. The Crown relied upon the statutory alternative of sexual intercourse without consent in the event that the appellant was acquitted of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. The offence was alleged to have occurred on 6 October 2000 when the complainant was aged fifteen.  
      
       
     5 A co-accused, PJK, was charged with the same offence in relation to a separate act of intercourse, alleged to have been committed by him immediately after the act relied upon against the appellant. 
      
       
     6 The appellant and the co-accused each pleaded not guilty. The trial concluded on the ninth day, namely 26 October 2001, on which date the jury returned verdicts of not guilty to the primary charge in relation to both accused. However, the jury found the appellant guilty of the alternative count of sexual intercourse without consent. PJK was found not guilty of the alternative count. 
      
       
     7 On 7 December 2001 his Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a term of three years and six months to commence on 26 October 2001 and to expire on 25 April 2005. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of two years and three months to commence on 26 October 2001 and to expire on 25 January 2004. 
      
       
     8 The complainant was born on 17 December 1984. At the time of the alleged offence she attended a local school.  
      
       
     9 The appellant was born on 25 September 1972 and was at the date of alleged offence employed as a welder’s assistant.  
      
       
     10 The Crown case and the defence case were summarised in written submissions to this Court by counsel for the Crown, as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The complainant and a group of female school friends went to a park on the evening of Friday, 6 October 2000. They had been in contact with the appellant by mobile phone. He and the co-accused joined the girls at the park later in the night. They brought bourbon and Coke, which they and the girls shared. The co-accused bought another bottle of bourbon later in the night. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant became affected by alcohol and she got into an altercation with a young man who was in the park, but not part of their group. She wanted him to tell her where one of her friends had gone. After this incident, the complainant wondered where her friend had gone and the Appellant pointed towards a dark area of the park and indicated that the friend was over there. He and the complainant went in that direction. One of the complainant’s female friends joined them, but was called back. This left the complainant and the Appellant alone. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant alleged that the appellant then grabbed her and forced her to the ground, then had penile-vaginal intercourse against her will. She said that she told him ‘No’ on many occasions, but he continued. The co-accused joined them and tried to put his penis in her mouth. The appellant ejaculated and was not wearing a condom. The co-accused then had penile-vaginal intercourse against her will. During that time, the appellant remained with them and touched and kissed her. Friends of the complainant eventually came over and she was helped to an area near a school and then to a toilet block where she was sick and then complained to several of her female friends that she had been raped by the two men. By this stage, the men had left. The complainant was taken to the Wollongong Hospital. It is apparent that she was in a distressed state and was not examined until approximately 10.15 am on Saturday, 7 October 2000. She had bruising to her arms and thigh and lacerations on her lower vagina, consistent with the history of sexual assaults by the two men that she gave to the medical officer. The DNA from semen samples taken from her trousers was consistent with the appellant’s DNA.” 
         
        
        
         
         Both accused gave evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         “The appellant agreed that he had penile-vaginal intercourse with the complainant but said that it was consensual. He agreed that he was alone with the complainant in the park after they had started to look for one of the complainant’s friends. He said they started kissing under a lamp, the complainant did not object to this, he felt her under her pants and again she did not object. She kissed him back. They moved to another part of the park and got on the ground where they had consensual penile-vaginal sexual intercourse after he had performed oral sexual intercourse upon her vagina. During the intercourse, she mentioned that she should not be doing this because she had a boyfriend, but on two occasions when the appellant asked her if it was alright to continue she indicated to him that he should continue. The co-accused came up to them and she agreed for him to have penile-vaginal intercourse as well. The appellant tried to help the complainant after her friends came over by offering her a drink and helping to put one of her shoes back on. He and the co-accused left the area to return to a hotel, where they had been planning earlier in the night to go and watch a band and buy CDs.” 
         
        
       
     11 There are four grounds of appeal. The first ground is that the verdict of guilty is unreasonable and cannot be supported in light of the verdict of not guilty in relation to the co-accused. It is convenient if I leave this ground until after I have dealt with the remaining three grounds. 
      
       
     12 Ground 2 is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the trial judge’s failure to direct the jury as to the significance of an acquittal to the credibility of the complainant.” 
         
        
       
     13 This ground was not the subject of a request for a direction by defence counsel at the trial and accordingly leave is sought to rely on the ground pursuant to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
      
       
     14 To support this ground counsel for the appellant relied particularly upon the following passage from the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at 122. 
      
       
        
         
         “It will often be appropriate to direct a jury that where they entertain a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of a complainant’s evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant’s evidence generally.” 
         
        
       
     15 The Chief Justice had earlier referred in his judgment (at p 121) to observations by Fitzgerald JA in R v Robinson (2000) 111 A Crim R 388 at 390 to the same effect. 
      
       
     16 The first matter to note in this regard is that the Chief Justice did not express the view that in every case where there is more than one count a direction along the above quoted lines is necessary.  
      
       
     17 In the instant case his Honour gave the jury a specific direction that they should examine the complainant’s evidence “with great care”. His Honour is recorded (at SU 22-23) as having stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “Now in this case one witness is essential to the proof of the Crown case namely, [the complainant]. Her evidence is the only evidence led by the Crown to satisfy you that she did not consent to the sexual intercourse and that  
         each of the accused did not know she was consenting 
          and for that reason, because it is the only evidence, you should examine and scrutinise her evidence with great care before you decide that a verdict of guilty should be brought in, if at all and you should only find each of the accused guilty, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the evidence of [the complainant]. 
         
        
        
         
         I should also say of [the complainant] that if you accept Dr Perl’s evidence you will find that she was affected in many ways by the alcohol that she consumed. One of the things that was affected was her memory and it would be dangerous to bring in a verdict of guilty against either of the accused without scrutinising her evidence with very great care.” 
         
        
       
     18 Obviously there is a corruption in the transcript. The italicised words should read “each of the accused did know that she was not consenting”. 
      
       
     19 I might say that the above was a particularly favourable direction so far as the appellant is concerned because, as I shall point out later, there was considerable evidence supporting the complainant’s evidence that she did not consent. 
      
       
     20 As I shall point out subsequently when dealing with the first ground of appeal, this was not a case where the verdicts of not guilty in relation to the aggravated sexual assault charges of both accused, and the acquittal of the appellant’s co-accused in relation to the alternative count, necessarily flowed from a reasonable doubt on the part of the jury concerning the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant’s evidence. 
      
       
     21 I think it is important when considering the second ground of appeal to note that his Honour gave the jury the following customary direction (SU 14):  
      
       
        
         
         “There is no rule you must or should put any witness and his or her evidence in a compartment as being either reliable or unreliable. You have a right as judges of the facts to say of any witness that you accept all of his or her evidence, that you reject all of his or her evidence, or that you accept some part and reject other parts. You may decide that any witness is accurate on some matters and inaccurate or mistaken in respect of others.” 
         
        
       
     22 Thus the credibility or otherwise of the complainant was the subject of significant directions by the learned trial judge and I am quite unconvinced in the circumstances of this case that any possible miscarriage of justice could have arisen by reason of the fact that his Honour did not give a direction in the terms suggested by the Chief Justice in Markuleski as quoted above. Accordingly, I would not grant the appellant leave to rely upon this ground. 
      
       
     23 The third ground of appeal is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the trial judge’s failure to adequately warn the jury of the dangers of relying on the evidence of the complainant.” 
         
        
       
     24 I have already referred in par 15 above to the strong direction which his Honour gave in relation to the credibility of the complainant. At the conclusion of the summing-up Mr Pearsall of counsel for the appellant asked his Honour to supplement the above quoted direction. Counsel said (at SU 54): 
      
       
        
         
         “Your Honour other aspects that might be mentioned to the jury to indicate reasons of her potential unreliability apart from just the consumption of alcohol, your Honour, are that she has given accounts on her oath which must be wrong.  
         
        
        
         
         She’s given an account on her oath to the police about the movements of [the co-accused] on the night which she concedes to be incorrect. She also gives a sworn account about what was taking place with Eddy, that is that she wasn’t involved in hitting Eddy, she was pretty clear about that. But on the evidence of Eddy and Amanda and maybe some others …” 
         
        
       
     25 His Honour interrupted counsel by stating “That’s a matter for the jury Mr Pearsall”. 
      
       
     26 In this regard counsel sought to develop the submission but his Honour declined to add further to the direction which he gave. 
      
       
     27 In essence the criticism by counsel for the appellant of the warning which his Honour gave was that it was restricted to the effect of the consumption of alcohol on the complainant’s memory as a factor potentially making her evidence unreliable to the exclusion of other factors. Thus, for example, the jury should have been informed that it may have affected her judgment and emotional lability. 
      
       
     28 It was submitted that this was a situation to which s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 applied, in that the complainant’s evidence was of a kind that may be unreliable. The judge was therefore remiss, it was argued, in that having been requested to give an appropriate direction to the jury in accordance with s 165(2)(b) his Honour did not adequately discharge the responsibility which subs (2)(b) imposed upon him, namely to inform the jury of matters that may cause the complainant’s evidence to be unreliable. 
      
       
     29 The Crown submitted in reply that the warnings which his Honour did give were adequate and focussed upon the phrase “One of the things that was affected was her memory”, in the warning quoted at par 15 above, to support the contention that his Honour clearly was not confining the warning to the effect which alcohol would have had on the complainant’s memory. 
      
       
     30 The Crown referred the Court to the following passage from the summing-up where his Honour expanded upon the evidence of Dr Perl. Specifically his Honour directed the jury (at SU 38) that the effect of Dr Perl’s evidence was that alcohol may have: 
      
       
     · impaired the complainant’s ability to make judgments;· caused the complainant to take risks that she would not take had she not consumed alcohol;· affected the complainant’s ability to perceive;· affected the complainant’s cognitive skills, and· impaired the complainant’s memory. 
      
       
     31 So far as the question of the effect of the alcohol consumed by the complainant is concerned I am of the view that his Honour’s directions were quite adequate.  
      
       
     32 Counsel for the appellant contended that further matters should have been the subject of warnings by his Honour. Those matters included inconsistencies in the testimony of the complainant, the difficulty in testing the complainant’s evidence due to the effect of alcohol on her memory, the reasons why the complainant might give a false version of events and the youth of the complainant. The jury should also have been warned, it was argued, that false complaints are sometimes made for reasons which may not be apparent and may never become apparent. As trial counsel did not specifically request directions in the above form, the Crown contends that Rule 4 applies. 
      
       
     33 I am not persuaded that his Honour failed adequately to warn the jury in the context of this particular case of the factors which might impair the credibility of the complainant.  
      
       
     34 In my view his Honour gave to the jury a very fair and balanced summing-up that included a very careful survey of the evidence and the appropriate directions of law. 
      
       
     35 It is important to bear in mind that his Honour carefully advised the jury that if they wished any part of the evidence to be re-read to them that could immediately be arranged. Further, that his Honour was available and anxious to provide any further explanation of the relevant principles of law and how they applied to the evidence before the jury.  
      
       
     36 I might add that the complainant was cross-examined in such detail and so expansively that her cross-examination extended over eighty-seven pages of transcript. The jury had ample opportunity therefore to make an assessment of her reliability. In the circumstances I would allow the appellant to rely upon this ground of appeal but I would reject the ground. 
      
       
     37 The fourth ground of appeal is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the Crown Prosecutor’s cross-examination of the appellant.” 
         
        
       
     38 This ground of appeal is based upon the following questions and answers in the cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown Prosecutor: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q: Do you recall Detective Warren saying words, ‘I am investigating a sexual assault that occurred at Lang Park, South Beach near Marine Drive, Wollongong either late in the evening of Friday 7 October or early hours of Saturday 8 October. I want you to understand that you do not have to say anything further, as anything that you say or do will be recorded and may be used in evidence, do you understand that?’. Detective Warren says that you remain silent for a short time and Detective Warren said, ‘Do you understand that?’. Then you said, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about’, do you remember a conversation along those lines? 
         
        
        
         
         A: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: When you said, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about’, were you trying – did you want to not let him know that you were actually at the park at that time? 
         
        
        
         
         A: No, it wasn’t. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: It (sic) said you remained silent for a short time. You understood what he was saying, though, didn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION: (Pearsall)” 
         
        
       
     39 The last question was objected to and no answer was given. However, the appellant contends that the damage was in the question, not in any possible answer. 
      
       
     40 In support of this ground the appellant sought to rely upon s 89 of the Evidence Act, which relevantly provides that in a criminal proceeding, an inference unfavourable to a party must not be drawn from evidence that the party failed or refused to answer one or more questions, or to respond to a representation put or made to the party in the course of official questioning. Further, subs (2) provides that evidence of that kind is not admissible if it can only be used to draw such an inference. 
      
       
     41 The appellant seeks to rely upon an affidavit by defence counsel at the trial in which he deposes that having objected to the last-mentioned question, he did not seek a discharge of the jury because, in his view, the trial as a whole was proceeding as well as it could be expected for the appellant. Further, that he did not believe that overall it was in the appellant’s interest to seek a discharge, notwithstanding the damage which may have been done “by the improper question”. 
      
       
     42 Detective Warren gave evidence in chief, without objection, of the conversation with the appellant, and his reaction, which formed the basis of the opening question quoted above. 
      
       
     43 His Honour, during the summing-up, made it perfectly clear to the jury that they must under no circumstances draw any inference adverse to the appellant by reason of the fact that he declined to answer questions posed to him by police officers.  
      
       
     44 This ground of appeal is misconceived in that no question of a breach of s 89 arises. 
      
       
     45 When the appellant stated “I don’t know what you’re talking about”, this was clearly a reference to the alleged sexual assault at Lang Park which the officer said he was investigating. The phrase used by the appellant was effectively a protestation of innocence and having made that protestation he rendered himself liable to cross-examination on it. 
      
       
     46 I do not consider that a possible miscarriage of justice arose on this occasion and I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     47 I turn then to the first ground of appeal that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable and could not be supported in light of the verdict of not guilty in relation to the co-accused. It was, understandably in light of the evidence, not argued that the Crown failed to establish sufficient evidence upon which the jury could have returned a verdict of guilty against the appellant. The argument was confined to the submission that the verdict of guilty against the appellant could not stand with the verdict of not guilty in relation to the co-accused. The appellant and the co-accused both admitted intercourse. Both said it was consensual. The complainant in evidence denied consent to intercourse with either accused.  
      
       
     48 It was argued that the acquittal of the co-accused represented a rejection of a critical aspect of the evidence of the complainant. A reasonable jury, it was then argued, would necessarily have also experienced a doubt as to the complainant’s evidence in relation to the appellant.  
      
       
     49 Particular reliance was placed by counsel for the appellant on the judgment of the majority of the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, especially at 494; Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and R v Markuleski (2000) 52 NSWLR 82, in which Spigelman CJ undertook an analysis of the reasoning in Jones and conducted an extensive review of the cases in which it had been applied. 
      
       
     50 The Chief Justice concluded in Markuleski (at 100) that the circumstances of a particular case may lead to the conclusion that a jury which has found that it had a reasonable doubt with respect to a complainant’s evidence on one count, ought to have had such a doubt with respect to other counts. However, the Chief Justice said, it does not follow that that must necessarily be the case.  
      
       
     51 It was argued that in the present case the counts against the appellant and the co-accused were part of a single episode. There was no relevant distinction, it was said, “between the counts against the appellant and the co-accused in relation to the availability of other evidence which might cast doubt on the complainant’s account. Nor was there any relevant distinction in the quality of the evidence relating to the different counts”.  
      
       
     52 In Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR at 316, McHugh J explained the approach required of an appellate court when considering whether a conviction should be set aside by reason of an apparent inconsistency in the jury’s verdicts. At pp 357-358 his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “When there is no legal or technical inconsistency in the verdicts, a conviction can only be set aside where the inconsistency in the verdicts demonstrates that no reasonable jury who had applied their minds to the evidence could have arrived at the two different verdicts. In such a case, the Court of Criminal Appeal sets aside the conviction because it is unsafe or unsatisfactory. 
         
        
        
         
         In determining whether the inconsistency points to an unsatisfactory conviction, the appellate court must consider the evidence, the issues, and the  
         directions 
          which the jury were given. In a case where the accused claimed that his conviction should be set aside because of the inconsistency of verdicts, McGarvie J said ‘[i]n considering this question it is vital to consider the way in which the trial Judge charged the jury’. An examination of the directions, issues and evidence may confirm that apparently inconsistent verdicts are in fact inconsistent and demonstrate that the conviction is unsafe. Just as frequently, however, examination of the issues, evidence and directions may show that apparently inconsistent verdicts are not inconsistent and that there has been no failure in the reasoning process of the jury.” [Citations have been omitted.] 
         
        
       
     53 It is necessary then to consider the relevant directions, issues and evidence touching upon this question in the instant case.  
      
       
     54 The onus rested upon the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that at the time and place alleged, the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant; without the complainant’s consent and knowing that the complainant did not consent. 
      
       
     55 There was no dispute at the trial in relation to each accused with regard to the first element.  
      
       
     56 As to the second and third elements, his Honour gave the jury the direction (inter alia) set out in par 15 above. 
      
       
     57 This was a particularly favourable direction so far as the accused were concerned because there was (with respect) significant evidence supporting the testimony of the complainant that she did not consent.  
      
       
     58 Firstly, there is the evidence of immediate complaint. After the alleged assaults the complainant was assisted to a nearby toilet where she vomited. Immediately she came out from the toilet she said to her girlfriend, JS, “They raped me and they wouldn’t stop and I said No” (T 17.10.01 p 192). The complainant said that the co-accused tried to “stick his penis in her mouth … and that they wouldn’t stop” (T 17.10.01 p 192). 
      
       
     59 Another young girlfriend, RP, gave evidence that when she came out of the toilet the complainant said, “They raped me”. When asked “Who raped you?”, the complainant said, “Those two guys that were just with us just then” (T 18.10.01 p 274). This witness said that as the complainant was being assisted toward the toilet she noticed that one of the complainant’s shoes was off and one of the accused was trying to put it back on her foot (T 18.10.01 p 275). 
      
       
     60 Another girlfriend, AS, saw the complainant near the toilet after the alleged offences. She deposed that the complainant looked “very upset”, was crying and shaking and “She told me that she was just with two blokes and she didn’t want to because she kept saying no because she had a boyfriend” (T 17.10.01 p 177). The witness described the complainant as being “in tears” and “she wouldn’t stop moving and she was like running around and she just kept screaming ‘I said no, but he wouldn’t stop’” (T 18.10.01 p 240). 
      
       
     61 Another girlfriend, TM, gave evidence that earlier in the evening it was clear to her that the appellant liked the complainant and was interested in her. She deposed that she heard him say to the complainant “I am going to get you drunk so I can take advantage of you”. The complainant replied, “I don’t think so” (T 18.10.01 pp 238-239). 
      
       
     62 Another young female friend, RP, went into the toilet with the complainant. She said in evidence of the complainant, “She was crying and she was mumbling something and I told her to like settle down a bit and just, she started relaxing and then she just mumbled something again and I go like, ‘What are you saying?’, and she goes ‘They raped me’”, then she started crying. The witness asked her, “Who raped you?” and she replied, “Those two guys that were just with us just then” (T 18.10.01 p 274). 
      
       
     63 More direct evidence was given by JS. She observed the following events when she came across the alleged assault. She said she saw the complainant on the ground and the appellant on top of her “and she was like fidgeting …”, and she saw the complainant’s legs move “like she didn’t want to be there”.  
      
       
     64 The witness observed that “one of her legs pants (sic) was off and one of her shoe (sic) was on and the other wasn’t”. She then went to contact one of the other girls (T 17.10.01 p 188). 
      
       
     65 The two accused left the scene and the complainant was driven to the Wollongong Hospital. The complainant gave evidence that she had fingerprint bruises on the tops of her arms, her back was swollen and there was a big bruise on the inside of her right leg (T 15.10.01 pp 12-13). 
      
       
     66 Evidence was given that the complainant arrived at the Emergency Department of the Wollongong Hospital around about 1 am on the morning of 7 October accompanied by her friend JS. She was seen by a doctor at 1.45 am, a sexual assault counsellor, and was found to be in a confused, agitated state and unable to give a verbal consent for forensic examination at that time.  
      
       
     67 At 10.15 am on 7 October the complainant was examined by Dr Jill Timbs, a legally qualified medical officer attached to the Sexual Assault Services, Wollongong. Dr Timbs observed the complainant was dishevelled. She was drowsy but able to give a clear history. The complainant said that she had some memory blanks and some details were confused.  
      
       
     68 Dr Timbs gave evidence of bruising which she found on the complainant’s body.  
      
       
     69 Examination of the external genitalia revealed several small lacerations on the left introitus. Foreign material present in the vulva was collected.  
      
       
     70 Dr Timbs concluded that the pattern of injuries to the complainant’s body was consistent with the history which the complainant gave of sexual assault by two men and lacerations of the introitus. She was of the opinion that the findings on examination were consistent with a history of sexual assault as detailed to her.  
      
       
     71 In cross-examination Dr Timbs said: “Yes it’s true that robust sex can cause those injuries” (T 17.10.01 p 170). 
      
       
     72 Dr Judith Perl, a member of the Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit with the New South Wales Police Service gave evidence. Dr Perl is a highly qualified pharmacologist.  
      
       
     73 Reviewing the case notes, Dr Perl noted that upon her admission to the Emergency Unit at the hospital, the complainant appeared “confused, agitated, fearful and was crying”. She was sedated with five milligrams of diazepam at 2.25 am and a further five milligrams was administered about 5.15 am. 
      
       
     74 A blood sample was taken from the complainant some time after 10.15 am on 7 October. That was analysed and in relation to alcohol in that blood sample there was an amount of 0.031 grams per 100 millilitres of blood. 
      
       
     75 Dr Perl deposed that the residual blood alcohol concentration found in the complainant’s blood after 10.15 am on the following morning suggested that:  
      
       
        
         
         “She was grossly intoxicated by alcohol earlier that night, especially when one considers that she vomited several times shortly after the incident. Vomiting would have expelled a significant amount of unabsorbed alcohol from her stomach, thus had she not vomited she probably would have had an even higher blood alcohol level.” 
         
        
       
     76 Dr Perl calculated that at about 1 am the complainant’s blood alcohol concentration would have been around 0.17 grams per 100 millilitres.  
      
       
     77 Dr Perl said: 
      
       
        
         
         “At this blood alcohol concentration all people, but in particular a young person relatively inexperienced with alcohol, would be significantly impaired in cognitive and motor functions. I would expect very significant impairment to have been present in the victim including impaired memory, impaired judgment and decision making, impaired co-ordination and impaired reactions.” (T 17.10.01 p154) 
         
        
       
     78 Dr Perl added that in addition to the impairment of those functions emotional lability is common. Further, there would be slurred speech and most likely very incoherent speech. For someone who was inexperienced with alcohol at that sort of level “They’d be sort of semi conscious”. Also the process of reasoning would be affected. (T 155) 
      
       
     79 DNA analysis of semen samples taken from the complainant’s underpants at the Wollongong Hospital on 7 October 2000 and the appellant’s blood (which he voluntarily gave after his arrest) showed that the DNA in the semen samples was consistent with the appellant’s DNA.  
      
       
     80 It is important to note in the context of Dr Perl’s evidence, that the complainant said during the course of her evidence that she just kept “like blacking out, like I was really scared and stressed” (T p 10). She said that she could not recall the co-accused saying anything before he placed his penis in her vagina. She was asked what happened after that. She replied,  
      
       
        
         
         “Then, it’s more blurry after that, like I can remember them like, them just keep talking and changing and things like that but I’m not like full sure after that, it was more, like it got blurry and, but then I remember (the co-accused) just on top of me and then after a while then I remember [J and R] coming over to me.” (T p 11) 
         
        
       
     81 I turn then to the directions which his Honour gave in relation to the third element which the Crown was required to prove to establish the subject offence. His Honour said relevantly (SU pp 6-8): 
      
       
        
         
         “The third ingredient of what the Crown must prove against each accused is knowledge. The Crown must prove to you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that the complainant did not consent. … 
         
        
        
         
         However, if you are satisfied that she did not consent then the Crown must also prove that each accused … knew that [the complainant] did not consent. 
         
        
        
         
         And this is a subjective, not an objective test, it is not what a reasonable person might think, it is what [the appellant] thought, what [the co-accused] thought. 
         
        
        
         
         You might ask, in the absence of an admission by the accused, if the Crown can prove that he was aware that she did not consent and the Crown ask you to infer that from other facts which it has set out to prove. If you find that [the complainant] did not in fact consent then [the appellant’s] state of mind at the time of the act of intercourse must be that he knew, actually, that she was not consenting and if the Crown satisfies you that that was the state of [the appellant’s] mind at the time of the act of intercourse then the third element of the charge has been made out. The same applies of course to [the co-accused]. 
         
        
        
         
         On the other hand an accused person’s state of mind might be that he honestly, though wrongly, believed that [the complainant] was consenting to the intercourse. That is not a guilty state of mind. It is for the Crown to prove that the accused had a guilty mind and if the Crown has failed to prove that at the time of intercourse each of the accused did not honestly believe that the complainant was consenting, then you would have to say that this element of the offence is not made out and return a verdict of not guilty of this charge against that accused.” 
         
        
       
     82 The Crown has led evidence on which the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to intercourse with either accused. The Crown also placed before the jury cogent evidence from which they could find to the requisite standard that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting. It is significant that the appellant was the first of the two accused to have intercourse with the complainant.  
      
       
     83 To my mind the acquittal of the co-accused can only reasonably be explained by the fact that the jury were not satisfied to the requisite standard that the co-accused subjectively knew that the complainant was not consenting to intercourse with him.  
      
       
     84 As the complainant kept blacking out and her speech was slurred and incoherent due to the effects of the excessive consumption of alcohol, the jury may have allowed for the possibility that the co-accused believed there was no significant resistance by her to his having intercourse with her. To my mind this is a rational explanation for the apparent inconsistency in the verdicts.  
      
       
     85 If, as I consider likely, this was the approach taken by the jury it does not require a conclusion that the jury had doubts about the credibility of the complainant.  
      
       
     86 In my view, to adopt the words of McHugh J in Osland, examination of the issues, evidence and directions shows that the apparently inconsistent verdicts are not inconsistent and there has been no failure in the reasoning process of the jury. I would therefore reject this ground of appeal.  
      
       
     87 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

     3 LEVINE J: The appellant (born 29 January 1935) stood for trial in the District Court at Parramatta before his Honour Judge Bellear and a jury having pleaded not guilty to an indictment containing six counts. The counts were: counts 1,2 and 5, indecently assault female under the age of 16 years (s76 Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty imprisonment for 6 years); count 3, carnal knowledge by father of female under the age of 17 years (s73, maximum penalty 14 years); count 4, buggery (s79, maximum penalty 14 years); and count 6, commit act of indecency on female under the age of 16 years (s61E (2), maximum penalty imprisonment for 2 years). 
      
       
     4 The appellant was found guilty on all counts and was sentenced on each of counts 1, 2 and 5 to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years from 11 August 2000; on count 3 to a fixed term of imprisonment for 4 years to commence on 11 August 2000; on count 4 a head sentence of 7 years was imposed to commence on 11 August 2000 and a non-parole period of 4 years was fixed commencing on that date to expire on 10 August 2004; on count 6, to imprisonment for 9 months by way of fixed term to commence on 11 August 2000.  
      
       
     5 The trial from the outcome of which the appellant appeals commenced before his Honour and the jury on 3 August 2000. It was the third trial, the earlier two having aborted on preceding days. The trial giving rise to the appeal was conducted with a remarkable lack of complication. The explanation for this lies in various matters which were raised before his Honour in the antecedent aborted second trial. The position of the parties was that “rulings” made by his Honour in connection with the second trial would apply to the third trial. It is, inter alia, those “rulings” which give rise to many of the grounds of appeal.  
      
       
        
       Course of trial - evidence 
        
       
     6 The Crown case was as follows (based upon its useful summary). The complainant, CPB, (born 7 February 1966) was the natural daughter of the appellant, TAB. In 1974 she moved to Numa Road, North Ryde, with her parents and her younger sister, SAB, (born on 15 February 1971). 
      
       
        
       Count 1 
        
        
       One day in 1977, before Easter, the appellant, while the complainant’s mother (PJA) was at work, put SAB outside to play and locked the door. He shut the curtains and pulled down the blinds. He sat on the lounge without any trousers or underpants and told the complainant to kneel in front of him. He guided her hands around his testicles and told her to rub his erect penis, which had Vaseline or baby oil on it. The appellant then told her to suck his penis and he put her hand around his testicles to rub there at the same time as she had her mouth over his penis. He told her she had to swallow, because it made a man feel good and feel like a real man. 
        
        
       The appellant told the complainant not to tell her mother because she would not like it and she would be upset with her. She did not know that it was wrong, just that she did not like it. The appellant did not intimate that it was wrong, but rather implied that her mother was snobbish and that she would not like it. Similar incidents occurred a number of other times in the same room, but not more than ten. They occurred about once every couple of weeks. The appellant always used Vaseline or baby oil and he always sent SAB into the yard or to the neighbours two doors down, the Robsons.  
        
        
       Counts 2, 3 and 4 
        
        
       At Easter time the complainant’s mother went away for the weekend to the Bathurst Motor Bike Races. SAB was sent outside and the Appellant closed the curtains in the lounge room and the bedroom. He told the complainant to get undressed and to lie on the bed on her back. He started sucking her breasts in turn and asked her which one was more sensitive. He said that women usually have one breast more sensitive than the other and then he started to rub her vagina with his hands and then his penis. Eventually she told him her left breast was more sensitive, not because it was, but to stop him from asking her. He got up to get the Vaseline from the bedside table and put some on his penis. He lay on top of her and put his penis in her vagina. This hurt her and she felt squashed under him and could not breathe properly. It seemed to go in about halfway. He then put his penis in her anus. After the appellant took his penis out of her anus she went to the toilet. When she wiped her vagina there was blood on the toilet paper. She thought she was having her first period but that did not occur until the following year. She did not wipe her anus. 
        
        
       Similar incidents happened on two or three other occasions prior to the appellant leaving the Numa Road home. Her parents’ relationship was deteriorating and the appellant told the complainant that her  
       “mother wouldn’t go to bed with him anymore and that a man needed to have it and that he loved [her] very much, that’s why he was doing this to [her] and that…it was an educational thing…that he was teaching her how to please a man” 
       . 
        
        
       After the appellant left the family home the complainant did not see him for a few months. In early 1979 she moved to Starkey Street, Forestville with her mother and sister. Her father then lived in a converted garage at Jersey Road, Wentworthville. It was about the size of a two-car garage, lengthwise. She visited him there from 1979 until sometime in 1982 when she convinced her mother that she had too much homework and that she would be better off staying at home to do her studies. She was supposed to go every second weekend but the appellant was unreliable so she went between 15 and 20 times a year, staying overnight every second or third visit. There was one double bed. The appellant slept on one side, SAB on the other side, and the complainant slept in the middle.  
        
        
       Count 5 
        
        
       At Wentworthville in 1979, after SAB was asleep, the appellant touched the complainant on the vagina. She had her pyjamas on when she got into bed and did not know how they were removed. The appellant rubbed her very lightly on the vagina at first and then firmer and faster until she had an orgasm. He then had her masturbate him until he had an orgasm. 
        
        
       Similar incidents of mutual masturbation occurred every time she stayed overnight until 1982 when she stopped visiting him in Wentworthville.  
        
        
       Count 6 
        
        
       Between late 1981 and very early in 1982 there was an incident where she put her hand on his penis and masturbated him. She did not recall anything else having occurred at the same time. 
        
        
       Sometime in 1981 the complainant spoke to her friend from church and school, Rosalyn Cole, telling her that her father had abused her and was still abusing her. She asked Rosalyn to keep it confidential but Rosalyn told her mother. The complainant also spoke to a friend of her sister’s, Jacqueline Pascoe. 
        
        
       On 15 January 1998 the complainant received a telephone call from her father. He said he had had a phone call from her mother the night before. The complainant asked why he was ringing her and he said,  
       “Oh, I thought this was all swept under the carpet”.  
       She said  
       “I don’t want to talk to you”  
       and he said,  
       “I was young and silly then” 
       . He said,  
       “You wouldn’t cause me any trouble, would you?”  
       and  
       “Think of what you’d have to go through” 
       . 
        
        
       Between 1982 and 1988 the complainant had contact with her father and his girlfriend, Wanda, at Christmas and perhaps one or two other times a year. The appellant would drop into her house about once or twice a year. The complainant liked Wanda so she and her husband would visit occasionally if they were invited. She said she continued to see her father and to send him cards because her family did not know about the abuse. If she cut off contact with him she would have had to explain herself, so she kept contact to a minimum. The appellant did not give her away at her wedding because she refused to let him; she did not know who took the video of her wedding. She agreed that she gave evidence in one of the earlier trials that she did not recall Wanda assisting her father by putting a bed on the floor for her and her sister when they stayed the night at Wentworthville. She did not agree that the bed at Wentworthville was a single bed. 
        
        
       In cross-examination the complainant said that she prepared a nine-page statement at Glebe Police Station on 5 February 1998. There was material that she volunteered to the police that was not put into the statement. She volunteered the material in the committal hearing. She provided an additional statement on 27 July 2000 which clarified some of the things she had said in her statement of 5 February 1998. 
        
        
       She said she was about 14 when she realised what her father was doing was wrong, but she already considered her relationship with her father to be vile, so realising it was wrong did not make any difference. She agreed that she spoke to him on the phone on various occasions and she and her husband attended barbecues with her father and his partner. 
        
        
       The complainant said she had had about ten discussions with Mrs Cole around 1981 – 1982 about the allegations against her father. She had said to Mrs Cole something to the effect:  
       “things happen and I cannot control my body once it gets to that point”  
       and that she, Mrs Cole, had understood what was meant. Rosalyn was not present at these discussions nor was Minister Cole, Rosalyn’s father. Mrs Cole suggested the complainant tell her mother. 
        
        
       The complainant agreed that four cards were addressed to her father. On one card were 18 kisses and 18 hugs, but she did not agree that they were under her name. She agreed that she and her husband sent a number of postcards to her father and his partner, Wanda, from overseas between 1991 and 1996. She agreed that her father took photographs of her between 1991 and 1997, some of them with her children after 1995. She agreed she went to dinner in Chinatown with her father on one occasion but she did not remember the date. She agreed her father provided her with a car when she worked at Qantas. 
        
        
       Jacqueline Pascoe met the complainant around 1980 to 1981. They began having private conversations around mid to late 1981. They spoke about ethical issues as teenage Christian girls. On one occasion when they were discussing sexual behaviour the complainant told Ms Pascoe that her father had raped her. Ms Pascoe asked her if it was more than once and she said  
       “Yes, lots of times”.  
       Ms Pascoe asked when it began and the complainant told her that she was about eight. She told Ms Pascoe that she thought that he had turned to her when his sexual relationship with her mother had broken down, and that they had sex whenever they were left alone in the house together and, after he had left the family home, whenever she had to go to his house on access visits. 
        
        
       Ms Pascoe and the complainant had many conversations over years, or at least over one year, about this issue. On one occasion the complainant told her that she was compelled to go to her father’s house and she was afraid that it would happen again and she would not be able to say no. When Ms Pascoe saw her again the complainant was upset and said that it had happened again, she couldn’t stop him. The complainant’s half-sister, SES, was eleven years older than the complainant. She gave evidence that she visited her father when he lived at Wentworthville a half dozen times. He had a double bed in the centre of the room. It was very cramped. 
        
        
       Rosalyn Davis (nee Cole) moved to Forestville in 1977. Her father was the local Anglican minister there. She became good friends with the complainant and also knew Jacqueline Pascoe. In mid to late 1981 the complainant told her, in effect, that her father had had sex with her a number of times from when she was little. Ms Davis asked if she had told her mother and the complainant said she had not, and swore her to secrecy. The second occasion they spoke about it was at a church youth camp in 1982. The complainant was upset about her parents divorcing, and Ms Davis was confused because she thought it would be a good thing for the complainant. The complainant was also upset because she wasn’t a virgin and she made it clear that this was because of her father. 
        
        
       They had another discussion later in 1982. The complainant was upset about having to go to stay with her father for a weekend. When she came back she told Ms Davis that he had tried to attack her again. The complainant wrote a note to Ms Davis in 1982 in which she referred to a discussion that they had had in Bible study which had upset her because she was concerned that she wasn’t acceptable to God because she was not a virgin and was not pure. Ms Davis was asked about the question in the note  
       “Why?”  
       and Ms Davis said,  
       “Yes, she asks ‘Why did God let this happen to me?’ ” 
       .  
        
        
       Pamela Cole was the mother of Rosalyn Davis and the wife of the Forestville Anglican Minister. The complainant was frequently in her home visiting Rosalyn. The complainant spoke to her one day in the church grounds, or in the house, and told her that she had to go to stay with her father for the weekends and that she did not want to go. She asked Mrs Cole to keep what she said to herself. The complainant told her that her mother insisted that she go and that the reason she didn’t want to go was that her father had insisted in the past that she sleep in a double bed with him. Mrs Cole told her she should tell her mother why she did not to want go but she said she would not tell her mother. They may have had other conversations about this but she did not recall. In cross-examination she agreed that, if the complainant had complained to her about a sexual assault by her father, she would have considered it very serious. She did not agree that she would have told her husband. She said that she considered the complainant  
       “of an age to make a decision”.  
       She would have respected her request. 
        
        
       The complainant’s mother (PJA) was married to the appellant in April 1974 after living with him in a de facto relationship. Shortly after they were married they moved to Numa Road, North Ryde. The appellant worked some of the period they lived there and she worked full-time, both during the day and at night. She employed a babysitter who came to the house some time after school and left around 6-6.30pm. There were occasions when the two girls were left alone with the appellant. In 1976-77 the marital relationship deteriorated badly. In 1977 she went to the Bathurst races for the Easter weekend. Some time in 1979 she and her two daughters moved to Forestville. After the appellant left the house in North Ryde in 1978, he did not see the two girls for about three or four months, and then he saw them periodically mainly on weekends. It was not more than six months until they saw him because there were financial matters relating to the separation that had to be dealt with. The girls often stayed overnight. PJA insisted that they see him because he was their father. They did not have a set arrangement; he saw them at different intervals such as after four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks. When the complainant was in Year 10 or 11 she refused to go. She said it was because she had so much study to do. When the complainant married she had insisted that her father not give her away. In cross-examination PJA agreed that the wedding ceremony had commenced with the wedding party standing in a line in a room at the complainant’s house. 
        
        
       SAB, the complainant’s younger sister, gave evidence that when she and the complainant stayed with their father at Wentworthville they slept in a double bed with him. In cross-examination he said that she remembered seeing Wanda Freeman at the Wentworthville address. She said neither her father nor Ms Freeman ever put bedding on the floor for her and the complainant. 
        
        
       Detective Senior Constable Natalie Antaw took the statement from the complainant on 5 February 1998. Detective Antaw had completed a specialist training course in relation to complaints of a sexual nature (Initial Response Officer’s Course). After the statement was taken it was forwarded to another police officer for further investigation. The officer taking the statement makes some judgment as to what is put in; it can take all day to make a statement. She did not have a recollection of being given Mrs Davis’ name. It was more than likely that if she had she would have put it in the statement. In cross-examination she said that she did not recall the complainant telling her that her father had masturbated her to orgasm but it would have been considered relevant to her statement. Detective Antaw agreed that if the complainant had said that between late 1981 and early 1982 at Wentworthville he had put her hand on his penis and made her masturbate him, that would have been relevant. She agreed that if a person’s name had been mentioned those particulars would have been detailed if she considered that it was relevant. In re-examination she said that she understood that in relation to complaint evidence she would not necessarily put it in the statement if she perceived that the complaint was not recent. 
        
       
     7 The appellant’s case was that none of the incidents alleged ever occurred and that the complaints were fabricated. He sought to show that he had a good relationship with the complainant which had been ongoing. He gave evidence that he did not remember his wife going to the Bathurst races at Easter 1977. When he moved to Wentworthville in 1978 he took only a suitcase. The garage, which had been converted into a granny flat, contained one single bed. He did not see his daughters until the end of 1979. They did not have structured access, but he saw them as often as possible, every few weeks or every month, sometimes every couple of months. They only stayed overnight twice. 
      
       
        
       On the first occasion that the girls stayed overnight they slept in the single bed and he slept on the floor. Ms Freeman helped to make up a bed of blankets on the floor. Subsequently his landlady told him if they stayed again he could sleep in her front room in her house on the property. The second time they stayed he slept in the front room of his landlady’s house whilst the girls slept in his single bed. The complainant had stopped coming to visit him because of her need to study. They spoke on the telephone often. They had a very good relationship. After she left school and started work she started to come over and they would visit her. She asked his advice about which job to accept. He gave her an unregistered Toyota not long after she started work at Qantas and helped pay for the registration. He took a number of photographs of the complainant and her young family over the years. He photographed the complainant’s son in his backyard at Pendle Hill while Ms Freeman, the complainant and her husband were in the house. 
        
        
       The appellant had met Wanda Freeman in 1974 and was her business manager until 1983 when they commenced a personal relationship. There were a number of social occasions with the appellant and Ms Freeman, and the complainant and her husband. The appellant said he had received a telephone call from the complainant’s mother (PJA). She was screaming and she sounded as though she may have been intoxicated. On 15 January 1998 he spoke to the complainant on the phone. He spoke to her along the lines:  
       “that I thought this was all over with your mother and don’t tell me she’s going to have another crack at me”,  
       referring to financial matters.  
        
        
       In cross-examination he agreed that he was a keen photographer and he liked to take videos. He denied that he ever sent SAB out to play by herself. To his knowledge SAB never went down to the Robsons’ herself. He denied that he told the complainant that he was doing certain things because he loved her and was educating her. He said in cross-examination that the first time the girls stayed overnight at Wentworthville was in late 1979 or early 1980 and the second and last time was in early 1980. He said he was very sick during the whole of 1978 and could not work. He said the bed that he and Wanda made up on the floor was between the bed and the window. Later he said the bed on the floor was alongside the bed, which ran along the wall. The bottom of the bed was approximately 2’ 6” from the doorway. After the complainant stopped going to Wentworthville he saw her when she was available. She went on day trips with him and SAB on rare occasions because she had too much study. He did not know about school holidays. He agreed that he took photographs of the complainant’s son on three occasions over two years but he only took photographs on special occasions. He said that the reason he rang the complainant after her mother had rung him was because she was in contact with her mother all the time and she might know something. He denied that he said the words alleged by the complainant in that phone call. He said that he had more cards from the complainant but he had thrown them out and kept only a few as memorabilia. After viewing the wedding video, the appellant agreed that he was wrong that the wedding party had lined up. They had walked in. He did not agree that the person presiding over the wedding was a Minister of religion. 
        
        
       Wanda Freeman (Majchrzak) was an entertainer when she met the appellant in the mid 1970s. He became her business manager. She visited him when he lived at Numa Road, [North Ryde] and saw the two girls there once or twice. She gave evidence that there was a single bed there. She was there in around 1980 when the girls stayed overnight a couple of times. They slept on the bed and the appellant slept on the floor or at his landlady’s house on the property. She said they made a bed for the appellant near the kitchen. She did not sleep the night there but would come back the next morning. 
        
        
       After Ms Freeman and the appellant commenced a relationship and the complainant was married, there was social contact between the four of them. Between the wedding in 1991 and 1997 there were approximately ten or eleven occasions when the two couples saw each other socially. When the complainant married, the appellant and Ms Freeman received an invitation. She gave evidence that when the complainant started work at Qantas she asked the appellant to help her get a car and he gave her one of his.  
        
        
       In cross-examination she said the appellant was sick on and off during 1978. In 1979 Ms Freeman had a job singing six nights a week. She called in to see him during the day. The job finished at the New Year and did not go into 1980. She said that the appellant did not have the children overnight during that period. She said that when she said, “ 
       I always made the bed up”  
       she only meant the two occasions the girls slept over, which were within a couple of months of each other. After they had slept over the two occasions they told their father that it was not comfortable, they were squashed up, so it was better if they did not sleep there. She said it was the manner of her speech when she said  
       “generally” 
        or  
       “the next morning” 
        and did not indicate that the girls had slept over on more than the two occasions, or that the appellant had slept on the floor on more than one occasion. She agreed that when the police spoke to her on 23 March 1999 at Merrylands Road, Merrylands she told them that the appellant was not at home. She did not agree that she saw a police officer at the front of the house and at the back of the house when she told them she had to go out. She went to the Post Office and when she returned ten to fifteen minutes later the police knocked on the door again. She told them he was not at home and at the same time he called out  
       “Who’s that?”  
       She denied that he had come back in the time she was out. She said that the complainant came to visit right through until she finished school. She disagreed that from early in 1982 the complainant stopped coming to Wentworthville. 
        
        
       Grounds of appeal 
        
       
     8 The first ground of appeal is in general terms to the effect that the trial miscarried. The fourteenth ground of appeal is the notification of leave to appeal against sentence. The following are the substantive grounds of appeal: 
      
       
     (2) The trial judge erred in permitting the prosecution to present an indictment containing a sixth count alleging that between 14 July 1981 and 7 February 1982 the accused had committed an act of indecency upon the complainant, she being under the age of 16, to wit, 15 years. 
      
       
     (3) The trial judge erred in ruling on 31 July 2000 that if the appellant raised character the prosecution was entitled to cross-examine the accused in respect to other allegations. 
      
       
     (4) The trial judge erred in permitting the prosecution to call “relationship evidence”. 
      
       
     (5) The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury in respect to the “relationship evidence” prior to, during or immediately after the giving of such evidence. 
      
       
     (6) The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury in respect of the “relationship evidence”. 
      
       
     (7) The trial judge erred in permitting the prosecution to lead evidence of “complaints” as prior consistent statements. 
      
       
     (8) The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury in respect of the “complaints”. 
      
       
     (9) The trial judge erred in rejecting the application of the accused for further directions on failure to complain. 
      
       
     (10) The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that evidence admissible on one count could not be used in respect to another count. 
      
       
     (11) The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of part of the contents of documents and opinion evidence. 
      
       
     (12) The trial judge incorrectly summed up the evidence of Rosalyn Davis. 
      
       
     (13) The trial judge erred in taking a verdict while a jury question remained unanswered. 
      
       
        
       As to ground (2) – act of indecency - 6th count 
        
       
     9 There were only five counts in the indictment when the appellant stood for what I gather to have been the first trial on 31 July 2000. The sixth count was included when the appellant was indicted on Wednesday 2 August 2000 and when further indicted on 3 August 2000 (the trial presently appealed from). 
      
       
     10 The sixth charge was that between 14 July 1982 and 7 February 1983 at Wentworthville in the state of New South Wales, he did commit an act of indecency with CPB, the said CPB then being under the age of 16 years, to wit, 15 years. 
      
       
     11 The evidence given by the complainant was:  
      
       
        
         
         “Q. During the period of time that you were visiting your father at Wentworthville, do you recall something happening between late 1981 and very early in 1982? 
          
         A. Yes, I can recall an incident where I put my hand on his penis and masturbated him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you know on that occasion if anything else occurred? 
          
         A. I can’t recall anything else having occurred”. 
         
        
       
     12 It was argued for the appellant that the act evidenced and relied upon to constitute the offence in the indictment was in fact one which amounted to an indecent assault and, subject to a statutory bar, should have been charged as such pursuant to the law in force at the time namely s76 Crimes Act as opposed to the section under which it was charged namely s61E (2). S78 of the Act, however, prevented any prosecution for such an offence where the complainant was over the age of 14 and under the age of 16 years after the expiration of 12 months from the time of the alleged commission of the offence. It was submitted that the offence here being an indecent assault, the charge of committing an act of indecency could not be brought under the present s61E(2) in an endeavour to avoid the statutory bar provided by s78. The decision of the High Court in Saraswati v The Queen (1990 –91) 172 CLR 1 was relied upon. 
      
       
     13 The subject matter of this charge had been discussed on 31 July 2000 and 1 August 2000 – that is, antecedent to the trial appealed from. As far as one can understand it from the transcript of the former, there was some indication that the Crown Prosecutor was conscious of what I will describe as the Saraswati difficulty. This however appears to have been in the context of the discussion of complaint evidence in respect of which, apparently, on 1 August 2000 his Honour ruled that it was not “fresh in the memory” and would not allow evidence as to that which became the substance of the sixth charge as complaint evidence. As I understood the submissions for the appellant, a further component was that in some way the sixth charge otherwise made admissible complaint evidence which his Honour had previously excluded. This matter (which counsel for the appellant conceded was “perhaps the least of the prisoner’s problems”) was developed with the benefit of hindsight which incorporated not only the substantive trial appealed from but the antecedent proceedings and any “rulings” contained in them. The real issue was whether in the light of the evidence extracted above the appellant had been properly charged according to law. 
      
       
     14 The evidence was of an act which in my view at law did not constitute an indecent assault as there was no assault. This is not a case to which Saraswati applies. Relevantly the facts in Saraswati (leaving aside carnal knowledge) involved the touching of the complainant’s breasts, buttocks and vagina which were held to constitute an indecent assault. Thus the reasoning of the High Court was that the legislation introducing the offence of an act of indecency was designed to cover a gap in the law in which indecent behaviour short of an indecent assault was not an offence (see McHugh J at 24-25). It was not permissible to charge an act of indecency when the matter really was an indecent assault, a fortiori, to circumvent the time bars in s78. 
      
       
     15 The events the subject of the charge occurred between late 1981 and early 1982 when the complainant was 15 years of age, no issue of consent arose and constituted, in my view, an act of indecency for which, in 1974, the Crimes Act was amended (Crimes and Other Acts (Amendment) Act, 1974) to include s61E(2) to cover this very situation. The appellant was properly charged. There is no substance in this ground viewed discretely.  
      
       
     16 As to ground 3, the “character” ruling, this was the subject of subsequent evidence during the course of the appeal, and was a matter of substance. I will return to it in due course.  
      
       
        
       Grounds 4, 5 and 6 - the relationship evidence  
        
       
     17 On 31 July 2000 there is recorded over pages 11-29 discussion arising from an application clearly made by trial counsel for the accused to have “relationship” evidence excluded. His Honour had available to him a statement made by the complainant, which is amongst the material before this Court, namely that of 5 February 1998. By reference to that statement the Crown agreed to “focus”, as it were, the evidence of the complainant, thus leading his Honour to “rule”: “So what you are saying is that those matters that you have left unmarked [i.e. in the statement] are matters that the Crown quite properly could put towards relationship evidence and that’s the way I certainly rule”.  
      
       
     18 The grounds for appeal complain of the judge erring in permitting the prosecution to call “relationship evidence” (Ground 4); of the judge erring in failing to direct the jury in respect of the “relationship evidence” prior to, during or immediately after the giving of such evidence (Ground 5); and the trial judge erring in his directions to the jury in respect to the “relationship evidence”. 
      
       
     19 The “relationship evidence” ultimately admitted was that similar incidents to those described in Count 1 occurred in the lounge room at Numa Road North Ryde up to about ten times. Having given evidence of the occasion the subject of Count 1, the complainant gave this evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did anything else like that on similar occasions? (sic) 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Are you able to say approximately how many times, I’m talking about the lounge room at Numa Road, North Ryde? 
          
         A. I don’t know how many other times. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. One other time or more than one? 
          
         A. More than one other time?  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Are you able to give a rough or a vague estimate? 
          
         A. A number of times, but not more than 10”. 
         
        
       
     20 Incidents similar to those the subject of Counts 2, 4 and 5 (touching of the breasts, vaginal and anal intercourse) are said to have occurred in the bedroom at North Ryde two or three times. The complainant’s evidence was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. The episode in the bedroom, did anything like that ever happen again? 
          
         A. Yes, it happened two or three more times. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. On these occasions, did they also happen in the bedroom or not? 
          
         A. Yes, also in the bedroom”. 
         
        
       
     21 In relation to count 5 (rubbing of vagina) the complainant recalled similar incidents occurring every time she stayed with the appellant at Wentworthville until she stopped visiting him in 1982. She said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did any similar incidents to that happen, other similar incidents when you were at Wentworthville visiting your father? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How often? 
          
         A. Every time we stayed overnight”. 
         
        
        
       The complainant went on to say that she stopped visiting her father at Wentworthville in 1982. 
        
       
     22 It is desirable to observe at this stage one aspect of the structure of the trial appealed from. This aspect received no attention during the course of the argument of the appeal. From page 8 of the transcript of the first day of the trial it is apparent that counsel for the accused exercised his right to make an opening address to the jury after that of the Crown Prosecutor. The contents of that address have not been reproduced. Page 20 of the transcript of the proceedings on 3 August 2000 (wrongly dated 31 March 2000) points to one component of the opening being concerned with statements made by the complainant to the police. The forensic position taken by the appellant can be summarised: the complainant was cross-examined as to the various statements she made to the interviewing police officers and some alterations therein; the complainant who described her relationship with her father as “vile”, was cross-examined as to her relationship with him being evidenced in some way by the writing of greetings on birthday cards, Christmas cards, attendances at and after her wedding and photographs with her children. The purpose of this line of cross-examination is evident. The complainant was cross-examined to the effect that none of the incidents occurred. This she denied. Her evidence was:  
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And that he’s never done what you’ve alleged that he’s done? 
          
         A. Is that a question? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you agree or disagree with that? 
          
         A. I beg your pardon. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I said that he’s never done what you’ve said he’s done, do you agree or disagree with that? 
          
         A. He has done what I said he did”. 
         
        
        
       Finally it was explicitly put to her: 
        
        
         
         “Q. Mrs [B], you understand what I’m saying to you, I’m saying that you fabricated the allegations against your father? 
          
         A. I have not”. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     23 It is appropriate to set out here the way in which the matter of “relationship evidence” was dealt with, not without a great deal of controversy, by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury. The relevant part commences:  
      
       
        
         
         “ You will recall, ladies and gentlemen, the learned Crown Prosecutor, in opening the Crown case to you, said that the complainant will tell you, in addition to the charges on the indictment, she will refer to similar things or other matters, not subject to any charge, happening on other occasions. This is what is commonly referred to by lawyers as relationship evidence.  
         As I have made clear, before you can convict the accused in respect of any count in the indictment you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that particular offence has been proved to have been committed 
         . Now, in addition to the evidence led by the Crown, specifically directed to the particular counts in the indictment, the Crown has led evidence of other acts of alleged misconduct by the accused towards the complainant. I shall, for the sake of convenience, refer to the other evidence as evidence of other acts”. 
          (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     24 His Honour then proceeds to summarise the evidence and continues: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown, as I have said to you, must identify specific acts and occasions for the court and it must prove these particular acts and not some other acts on other occasions. That is fundamental to this case. That does not, however, mean that you may not take into account some wider sexual history if it is proved; that is the evidence of other acts of a sexual nature between the accused and the complainant.  
         You do not do that in order to substitute those other acts on occasions for those charged 
         . The history of a wider series of sexual events is led for a different purpose altogether and it is important for you to understand what that purpose is. It is to place the evidence of the particular acts into a true and realistic context and, where appropriate, to show the  
         existence of guilty passion 
          on the part of the accused for the complainant. Otherwise, you see, a jury, such as yourselves, may wonder as to the likelihood of apparently isolated acts occurring suddenly, without any apparent reason, without being repeated. 
         (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
         
         If a complainant gave evidence of isolated acts of that kind, you would be entitled to say to yourselves, as people of commonsense, well really it is very odd for there to be such isolated acts between these persons which were not repeated or which had no precursor. For that reason you may have cause to entertain some doubt as to the likelihood or accuracy of the witness. If, however, the particular acts charged are placed in a wider context, that is a context of an ongoing history and show or tend to show the existence of  
         a guilty passion 
          on the part of the accused for the complainant, then the curious feature would disappear. It is for that reason that the law limits  
         [sic; scil. ""permits”] 
          a wider sexual history to be proved; it is to avoid artificiality or unreality in the presentation of the evidence and to demonstrate, where appropriate, the existence and continuation of a strong desire on the part of an accused person for another person. For one of two incidents to be artificially isolated and selected and for a witness to be confined to them could make it very difficult for her to proceed intelligently with her evidence. To pick out, for example, two incidents separated by lengthy periods could leave you with a very strange and unrealistic account. However, I emphasise to you again that you must not substitute evidence of other acts for the specific act charged and you must not reason on the basis, ‘well, this accused must have done some wrong things on other occasions relating to this girl and therefore we will convict him on these two particular acts’ or the number of particular acts. The Crown must prove those particular acts beyond reasonable doubt and those acts are the ones referred to in the indictment. You have the wider history merely to place her evidence in the context and, if you think it appropriate, to show the existence of a  
         strong desire 
          for her by the accused”.  
         (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     25 In the absence of the jury the following exchanges took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour referred to the relationship evidence and used the words ‘guilty passion’ on, I think, three occasions. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes, and then I corrected myself at the bottom there. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: I know, but could your Honour just make it clear - -  
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: And then I said - -  
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour said all the right words but used that ‘guilty passion’ a couple of times. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I will, and I think it’s important. One of the reasons I stopped was because I did refer to it and I can’t think of the name of the case, I think there is one recent one - anyway, it said that it wanted to get rid of the words ‘guilty passion’. But the direction that I had had it in it. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s the..(not transcribable)..when it didn’t matter. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I certainly will correct that. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: The only other factual thing, and your Honour sort of said, “There is no evidence whether she ever screamed or did anything on the other occasions”. I think her evidence clearly says, “On no occasion I ever said anything”. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: And I think I said that again after. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: You did say that but your Honour said, “There is no evidence of it but…”. So, that was the only thing. 
         
        
        
         
         SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
         
        
        
         
         RESUMPTION 
         
        
        
         
         IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Before I continue on, if I can just go back to when I was giving you a direction with respect to relationship evidence and a term I used and I’m not sure how it came into my vocabulary but it should not have and I want to take that term out and have you expunge it from your minds altogether. I said this, in effect, I will not go through all of it, but I said, “If, however, the particular acts charged are placed in a wider context, that it is a context of an ongoing history and show or tend to show the existence of a “guilty passion.” Now, the term “guilty passion” I should never have said and that is the term I want you to expunge from your minds completely. And, I should have said, “show or tend to show the existence of a strong desire”. And, again, I said it on two occasions actually, and the other occasion was “the existence and continuation” and I used the term “guilty passion” again. I should not have said it there either 
         . It should have been “the existence and continuation of a strong desire on the part of the accused person for another person”. “Guilty passion” is out 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, should not use that term either. The Crown really led it only as relationship evidence to put it in the context. Your Honour has given the directions in relationship evidence but we didn’t itemise – for us to lead it in the other way we have to go through and detail every one. We didn’t do that so the Crown says that just falls within relationship evidence to put it within context, neither guilty passion or strong desire is not to be used that way. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: It’s not necessary at all. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: It is not to be used in that way, it’s just to be used in the context of placing it in - not showing they were isolated events. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Ladies and gentlemen, you have just heard Mr Crown correct me again, and Mr Crown is quite right, I should not have used that at all anyway. What the other acts complained of, and they are referred to as ‘other acts’, they are only to put it all in context, to show that there were not just these offences on the indictment had occurred by themselves. They were there, given to show how they were placed and the context in which they were put to make it a way for you to look at them in deciding these particular matters.” 
          (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     26 In this context I turn to the appellant’s submissions. It was argued that counsel at trial had submitted that the allegations were in the nature of general sexual misconduct and were insufficiently precise to enable them to be “dealt with”. I do not understand what is meant by the expression “dealt with”, in the light of the stance and structure of the defence “case”. His Honour allowed the evidence and it was presented in the form set out above. It was submitted that the prosecution was actually introducing evidence in the nature of “tendency evidence”. Thus, it is submitted that the effect of what was “proposed” and what then occurred was that incorrectly the prosecution avoided having to particularise acts, dates and places and was incorrectly permitted to lead evidence of general sexual allegations which ultimately could not be linked to specific counts in the indictment. Pausing there, when one considers the nature of the testimony given, the link between the acknowledged generality of the evidence is inexorably to specific incidents of which the complainant was giving testimony.  
      
       
     27 It was further argued that to have been admissible, the acts had to be precisely defined as to time, place and character. In the written submissions there is a reference to a decision of this Court in Regina v Marsh [2000] NSWCCA 370 and particular reference to paragraph [18] of the judgment of Adams J. What his Honour there said as to the requirement of precise definition must however be viewed in the context of the facts with which the Court there was concerned, and they were extraordinary in the context of sexual assaults. The other acts by reason of their character not subject to charge, in Marsh, were acts of violence and assaults in the context of testimony that covered both consensual and non-consensual sexual activity. There, there was a clear difficulty in relating evidence of the other acts to the sexual acts complained of. Understood in that context, his Honour’s remarks are perfectly correct but they are not necessarily apposite to the situation in the present appeal. 
      
       
     28 The arguments in support of these grounds then proceeded to assume that it was the Crown’s intention, and it was in fact the effect of the evidence, to prove “tendency” or “propensity”. When one considers the evidence there is no sensible basis on which a view of it as “tendency” evidence can be formed. Such as it was, in my view, the evidence clearly was admissible as relationship evidence and nothing more. The Crown did not seek to rely on it as tendency evidence, it could not have that effect and further particularity was not required.  
      
       
     29 The submissions led to an examination of the decisions of the High Court in Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106 and KRM v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 550. 
      
       
     30 The judgment of the High Court in Gipp was delivered on 16 June 1998 and as shortly thereafter as 10 August 1998 in Regina v RM Fraser (NSWCCA unreported 10 August 1998, Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sperling J) it was held that unless the High Court otherwise decides (the decision in Gipp lacking a clear ratio), the law in relation to the admission of (relationship) evidence should be taken to be as declared in Regina v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 and Regina v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702. Both these decisions received the consideration of this Court (Spigelman CJ, Heydon JA and James J) in Regina v Dann [2000] NSWCCA 185 in which it is to be observed that Heydon JA not inappropriately remarked with reference to both Gipp and Fraser that “the authorities in relation to these issues bristle with problems” at [34]. 
      
       
     31 It may be thought that some degree of clarification as to the position of the High Court at least with respect to “relationship” evidence was achieved in its decision in KRM. Leaving to one side the fact that within KRM their Honours, particularly Kirby J, seem to dispute whether or not Gipp and the respective judgments therein constitute clear authority, McHugh J having (from paragraph [20]) examined the authorities in relation to propensity evidence and in due course having come to the judgment of Gaudron J in Gipp, concluded in paragraph [31] as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “By reason of the divided reasoning of the majority in  
         Gipp 
         , it cannot yet be said that evidence of uncharged acts of sexual conduct is no longer admissible to prove the relationship between the parties. Until this Court decides to the contrary, courts in this country should treat evidence of uncharged sexual conduct as admissible to explain the nature of the relationship between the complainant and the accused, just as they have done for the best part of a century. But that said, trial judges will sometimes, perhaps often, need to warn juries of the limited use that can be made of such evidence and will have to give a propensity warning concerning it”. 
         
        
       
     32 I do not understand that even there his Honour is saying that in every case in which “relationship” evidence of the present kind is inadmissible, or, if admitted, that a propensity warning is required. His Honour is merely pointing to the occasion that might arise where such a warning, in addition to a direction as to the use to be made of the “relationship” evidence would have to be given. Hayne J said (at [143]): 
      
       
        
         
         “ I …agree with McHugh J that until this Court decides to the contrary, courts should treat evidence of uncharged sexual conduct as admissible to explain the nature of the relationship between the complainant and the accused, just as they have in the past. I agree that this may well mean that trial judges must warn juries of the limited use that can be made of evidence of that kind and that sometimes, perhaps often, they will have to give warnings about propensity reasoning”. 
         
        
       
     33 It seems to me that the only course this Court can take in this appeal, in relation to a state of law which is perhaps best described as “fluid”, is to adopt the approach in Fraser that the law in Beserick and AH is still that which applies. It seems to me that nothing said in KRM detracts from that proposition. In fact the High Court has recognised (notwithstanding some internal dispute as to that fact) that until the uncertainty arising from the decision in Gipp is resolved, the status quo referred to by both McHugh and Hayne JJ is applicable in this State.  
      
       
     34 Thus far I am of the view that his Honour did not err in admitting the evidence, and that there is no error in its characterisation by the Crown as being nothing more than “relationship” evidence and not being tendered as tendency/propensity evidence. 
      
       
     35 In relation to ground 5, failing to direct the jury in respect of “relationship” evidence prior to, during or immediately after the giving of such evidence, it is the fact that his Honour recognised that he should do so .His Honour did not do so at the time of its admission. Viewed discretely I am not persuaded that there was any miscarriage by this oversight. The evidence as has been set out above was very briefly and simply given and in the end, subject to their correctness, the directions at the end of the trial would otherwise be sufficient. 
      
       
     36 From the extracts from the summing up set out above it is, as was submitted for the appellant, clear that the expression “guilty passion” was inappropriately used by his Honour. I am not persuaded that this reflected confusion in the trial judge’s mind as to the basis upon which the fairly minimal “relationship” evidence was admitted, namely solely as relationship and not tendency/propensity evidence. It was an unfortunate slip. I am not persuaded further, as was submitted for the appellant, that the jury must have been confused to the point where they did that which his Honour in fact twice enjoined them not to do (notwithstanding his use of “guilty passion”), namely to take into account “some wider sexual history if it is proved; that is the evidence of other acts of a sexual nature between the accused and the complainant. You do not do that in order to substitute those other acts on occasions for those charged” and where, towards the end of the second extract above, his Honour emphasised once again how the jury must not use the “relationship evidence” and what its purpose was. I am not persuaded by the submissions by senior counsel for the appellant that this unfortunate inadvertence resulted in the outcome he submitted and thus a miscarriage. 
      
       
     37 There is one other matter that must be dealt with in my view. It is contended that his Honour gave the jury no real assistance as to how they were to use the “relationship evidence”. I disagree. He explained it in terms of its background nature and was repetitive in his direction to the jury that they do not use it as a substitute for finding each count in the indictment proved beyond reasonable doubt. A submission however was made for the appellant that a direction should have been given to the jury that it should have no regard to assertions of other sexual misconduct unless “satisfied beyond reasonable doubt” that the evidence proved the commission of these offences not charged. No New South Wales authority was cited in support of this proposition. Reference was made to two decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia: R v Peake (1996) 67 SASR 297 and R v R SCCRM-98-45, SCCRM-98-46 (17 June 1998). In the latter their Honours relied upon the decision in the former where, on reading it, it seems quite clear that such a direction would be required. Olsson J in Peake gave a lengthy, reasoned judgment making due reference to Pfennig v The Queen (1994) 182 CLR 461, Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334 and other decisions of the Supreme Court of South Australia in relation to propensity evidence and how the jury should be directed upon it. He nonetheless at [309.5] merely states that counsel was correct when he asserted before that court that it was essential that it be made clear to the jury that before it could rely on disputed evidence of prior conduct going to relationship it had first to be satisfied of its accuracy beyond reasonable doubt. If the decisions of the Supreme Court of South Australia can be understood as starkly asserting it to be the law that in a case where relationship evidence is given of the present kind (not tendency/propensity evidence), the jury, before it could make any use of it as “relationship” evidence and only for that purpose, it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in respect of it, then I cannot accept that to be the law. An explanation is given to the jury as to why the evidence is there to set the “background” of the “relationship”. The jury is warned in clear terms that that evidence cannot be used in substitution for its finding beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved on the evidence brought in relation to each count guilt on each count. I cannot see how in a case such as the present, any such standard of proof direction usefully, and safely could be given.  
      
       
     38 Our attention was drawn to the statement of Gaudron J in Gipp in a context where the whole of the judgment in that appeal discloses that the trial judge said no more than that there was no need for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the background facts provided they accepted the complainant’s account that it occurred (see p 111, paragraph 8). Her Honour found in the circumstances of Gipp that the evidence in any event was inadmissible (page 113, paragraph 12). It having been admitted, however, her Honour said (at 115 paragraph 21): 
      
       
        
         
         “The bare direction to the jury that they had only to be satisfied with respect to that evidence  
         on the balance of probabilities 
          was erroneous and dangerously so. It left open the possibility that the jury might reason from a finding, on the balance of probabilities, that there was a relationship involving regular sexual abuse, that the appellant was guilty of the specific offences charged”. 
          (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
       
     39 Her Honour went so far as she did expressly to state the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt. It is interesting to note that her Honour did so apparently informed by her understanding that the trial judge had left it to the jury to be determined on the balance of probabilities. There is no indication that the trial judge in that case expressly did so. All that he did was say that there was no requirement to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Nowhere in the High Court report is there any indication of the trial judge using the language of, or otherwise referring to, the civil standard of proof.  
      
       
     40 In their joint judgment McHugh and Hayne JJ, having set out the relevant passage from the summing-up of the trial judge in relation to there being no need for satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt, went on to say:  
      
       
        
         
         “[75] The trial judge did not direct the jury that, if they accepted that the appellant had sexually interfered with the complainant on occasions other than those charged, they could use that fact to infer that the appellant had committed the offences which were the subject of the five counts left to them. The evidence tendered was general in its nature and…was admitted for the limited purpose of making the circumstances of the specific offences more intelligible. It was admissible because it was evidence ""as to acts so closely and inextricably mixed up with the history of the guilty act itself as to form part of one chain of relevant circumstances”…Counsel might have objected to the generality of the evidence and insisted that the complainant should recite in detail, so far as she could, the times, places and manner of these sexual interferences. But he preferred - what seems to us to have been the better forensic choice - that the evidence of the sexual history should be given shortly and without prejudicial detail.  
         
        
        
         
         [76] If the evidence of sexual history had been directed to specific incidents, although not the subject of charges, the learned judge would have been entitled to direct the jury that if they found one or more of those incidents proved, they could use such a finding or findings as proof of a ""guilty passion"" in support of the charges in the indictment…In  
         that 
          event, it would have been necessary to direct the jury that these incidents as well as the charges had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
         
        
        
         
         [77] No doubt the evidence of general behaviour, if accepted, proved the commission of other criminal acts. But it was not tendered as propensity evidence. If the evidence had been tendered to prove propensity, it would have required careful direction in accordance with the principles emphasised by this Court on numerous occasions in recent years (See, eg,  
         Pfennig v The Queen 
          (1995) 182 CLR 461). Moreover, as  
         BRS v The Queen  
         (1997) 191 CLR 275 
           
         shows, if evidence admitted for reasons other than propensity in fact reveals a criminal or reprehensible propensity on the part of the accused, a trial judge must carefully direct the jury as to the use which they can make of the evidence ( 
         BRS 
          (1997) 191 CLR 275 at 305-306). In  
         BRS  
         (at 305) McHugh J pointed out: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ""If the evidence is admitted for a reason other than reliance on propensity, the judge must direct the jury that they can use the evidence for the relevant purpose and for no other purpose. In some cases, the judge may need to be more specific. He or she may need to direct the jurors that they cannot use the evidence for an identified purpose. If the evidence is admitted because the Crown wishes to rely on the accused's propensity as an element in the chain of proof, it is especially necessary that the judge give the jurors clear directions as to the manner in which they may use the propensity evidence.""  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         [78]  
         In this case, the learned judge correctly directed the jury that the background evidence went to show the nature of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant so that they could understand the context of the incidents that were the subject of the charges. No doubt, it would have been better if his Honour had gone further and expressly told the jury that, if they found that there was a previous or continuing history of incidents, they were not to use that finding to reason that the accused committed the offences charged. But his Honour's failure to take that further step does not mean that he necessarily misdirected the jury or that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory or that there has been a miscarriage of justice 
         . Having regard to the conduct of the case and the rest of his Honour's summing up, there is no reason to suppose that the jury might have used the general behaviour evidence as propensity evidence. Neither counsel nor the judge suggested that course. Furthermore, the whole thrust of the summing up was that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant's evidence in respect of each incident was reliable.  
         
        
        
         
         [79]  
         No doubt it would also have been better if his Honour had made no mention of the standard of proof when referring to the background evidence. But his Honour's statement was not a misdirection. It is the charge, not the surrounding facts, that must be proved beyond reasonable doubt 
         . Sometimes, a fact may be so indispensable to a finding of guilt that it is necessary to direct the jury that that finding be proved beyond reasonable doubt even though that fact is not one of the ultimate facts that constitute the offence. But, as Dawson J pointed out in  
         Shepherd v The Queen 
          ((1990)170 CLR 573 at 579) where:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ""the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning. It should not be given in any 
            event where it would  
           be unnecessary or confusing to do so 
           .""  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         That statement was made with respect to circumstantial evidence but is equally applicable to a case such as the present.  
          
         The evidence concerning the relationship of the parties in this case was not…an indispensable link in a chain of reasoning leading to an inference of guilt”. 
          (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     41 It is clear that so far as their Honours were referring to any requirement for proof beyond reasonable doubt, it was not in the case of “relationship” evidence of the kind with which we are here concerned but rather, when the uncharged sexual offences can properly be defined as “propensity/tendency evidence” or otherwise constitute the “indispensable” facts to which their Honours refer. 
      
       
     42 This in my respectful view also accords with the reasoning of Kirby J:  
      
       
        
         
          
         “[139] Before this Court, the Crown properly conceded that the reference by the primary judge to the standard of proof relating to the evidence of prior molestation was ""undesirable and should not have been made"". It was ""unfortunate"". I entirely agree with these epithets. Where such facts may constitute ""indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt""…it may be appropriate (and would have been appropriate in this case) to warn the jury that each ""link"" must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  
         
        
        
         
         [140] Additionally, where evidence of the kind admitted in this trial is received, special care must be exercised in the use to which it is put because of its significant potential to cause prejudice to the accused. This type of evidence has been classified in various ways. It has been called ""dispositional"", ""background"", ""tendency"" (See s97 of both The Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and the Evidence Act 1995 (New South Wales) which provides that such evidence is inadmissible unless it would have significant probative value and s101, which provides that it may not be adduced by the prosecution in a criminal trial unless its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant…Analogous rules apply to “coincidence” evidence: ss 98, 101 
         , 
          ""propensity""…""relationship""…or in some circumstances, ""similar fact” ( 
         Hoch v The Queen 
          (1988) 165 CLR 292 at 294) evidence. Although each of these terms has its own drawbacks, and whilst each has been used differently, in my view, all are apposite to the present case.  
         My own preference, on the basis that it is harmonious with the wording of the Uniform Evidence Acts (being the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Whilst these Acts do not, of course, apply in this case, it is useful to consider how they have expressed the relevant test:  
         R v Swaffield 
           
         (1998) 192 CLR 159 at 208) 
         , is to use the term ""tendency"" evidence. 
           
         
        
        
         
         [141] Evidence of this kind is only admissible if its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect…This Court has repeatedly warned of the dangers of allowing such evidence to be admitted, of permitting it to be received without immediate warnings as to the limited basis upon which it may be considered and then of the need to direct the jury, in the concluding charge, on the way in which, if at all, they should use such evidence…I accept what was recently said in this regard by the Court of Appeal of Victoria in  
         R v Vonarx 
          (Unreported, Court of Appeal of Victoria, 15 November 1995 at 12-13 per Winneke P, Callaway JA and Southwell AJA):  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ""[W]here evidence of criminal conduct, other than that which is charged, is being introduced into the evidence on the trial, the jury ought to be clearly told that evidence of such conduct can be used by them only if they are satisfied that it occurred and only for the limited purpose of determining whether a sexual relationship existed between the complainant and the accused, thereby enabling the evidence relied upon by the Crown in proof of the offences charged to be assessed and evaluated within a realistic contextual setting. They should be told not to reason that the accused is the kind of person likely to commit the offence charged.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           The jury should also be clearly instructed that evidence of other sexual activity does not itself prove the offences charged. It is of the utmost importance that the jury be told that the accused can be convicted on any count alleged against him ... only if they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the facts alleged in that count occurred. It is impermissible to convict the accused on the basis that, although the conduct so identified has not been proved to the requisite standard, some other conduct alleged by the victim has occurred"".  
            
           
          
         [142] In the present trial it is doubtful that the probative value of the evidence of the complainant concerning alleged events outside the offences charged outweighed the substantial prejudicial effect of such evidence. However, assuming that it did, and that the evidence was therefore admissible as tendency evidence, far from giving the stringent warnings required by law at the point that the evidence was received and at the point at which the concluding instruction was given to the jury, the primary judge gave absolutely no warnings about the dangers of the use of such evidence. On the contrary, he instructed the jury that they could be satisfied on the evidence otherwise than beyond reasonable doubt. Read in context, such instruction was a most serious misdirection…It is perfectly possible that, in this case, the jury reasoned to the appellant's guilt of the offences charged from satisfaction that the appellant did have an ongoing sexual relationship with the complainant, going back, as she had stated in her evidence, years before the times alleged in the counts of the indictment. It is equally possible that the jury, conforming to the judge's directions, reached their satisfaction on a link in the chain of their reasoning other than according to the criminal standard of proof”. 
          (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     43 Arguably Kirby J’s reasoning can be said to have been affected by his Honour’s choice of, and preference for, the term “tendency” evidence as he indicated in paragraph [140] cited above. 
      
       
     44 My understanding of the judgments of the High Court, and indeed of the Supreme Court of South Australia, lead me to the view that at best the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt applies when a clear case of “tendency” evidence is tendered by the Crown or, (which is certainly not the case here), the effect of “relationship” evidence is to establish a tendency. Otherwise, the observations of McHugh and Hayne JJ at paragraph [79] as to the trial judge more desirably having made no mention of the standard of proof are applicable. I would add that it could be understood that there were those sound forensic reasons for not exploring in detail the generalised allegations referred to by their Honours at the end of paragraph [75] in the present trial, the more so when the position of the defence was that nothing had occurred and that the complainant’s evidence was a fabrication.  
      
       
     45 As to grounds 4, 5 and 6 I am not persuaded that any miscarriage of justice occurred, notwithstanding what in the end was the unfortunate inadvertence, but one satisfactorily cured by his Honour in the course of his summing-up. 
      
       
        
       Grounds 7, 8 and 9 
        
       
     46 These grounds relate to the trial judge having erred in permitting the prosecution to lead evidence of complaints as prior consistent statements (ground 7); in his directions to the jury in respect of complaints (ground 8) and in rejecting the application of the accused for further directions on failure to complain (ground 9). 
      
       
     47 On 1 August 2000 his Honour ruled in favour of the accused by rejecting evidence of complaint as being inadmissible under s66(2)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 as being not sufficiently “fresh”. Counsel for the accused appropriately informed his Honour that the accused’s position would be that the complainant’s evidence was fabricated. His Honour thereupon granted leave to the Crown to lead evidence pursuant to s108(3) of the Evidence Act. One may fairly assume that the indication given to his Honour on 1 August 2000 as to fabrication was no doubt covered by the appellant’s trial counsel in his opening address to the jury to which I have referred above. 
      
       
     48 The evidence was thus admitted as prior consistent statements by the complainant to rebut the evidence of fabrication. That evidence is set out in the summary of trial above and was given by witnesses Pascoe, Davis and Cole. The complainant’s evidence as to her making complaints referred to a period towards the end of the time when her father was engaged in a sexual relationship with her and during the currency of the offences. There was a general coincidence as to the timing of the complainant raising the matters with the respective complaint witnesses however the following observations can be made: the complainant’s statements were not “offence specific”; the complainant’s evidence in particular did not coincide in detail with that of Mrs Cole. Mrs Cole was unable to recall in her evidence any statement by the complainant in relation to the accused masturbating her to orgasm.  
      
       
     49 In his summing-up to the jury his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ I give you, ladies and gentlemen, the following direction as to complaint. The Crown has led evidence of that complaint in order to meet the suggestion made by the accused that the complainant has not told you the truth in her evidence here in court. The Crown argues that the time at which the complaint was made, together with the circumstances in which it was made, demonstrate that her version has always been consistent. In other words, the evidence is relevant to the credit of the complainant as a witness, in that it may increase the weight which you give to her evidence as to the alleged sexual assault with which the accused is charged. However, it is not evidence as to what actually happened between the complainant and the accused, as the person to whom the complaint witness made was not present and did not see what happened between them.” 
         
        
       
     50 After giving this direction his Honour set out the defence position in relation to the account given to Mrs Cole and the different account given by the complainant. His Honour referred to submissions made by counsel for the accused conformably with the evidence in the trial that the complainant made no mention of any of these events to her mother – she kept her silence and had been told by her father not to mention it to her mother, and that she had sworn her confidants to secrecy. 
      
       
     51 I add that his Honour’s summing-up then thoroughly, in detail and in my view favourably reviewed the defence position in this trial. Having done so his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
          “It is here, ladies and gentlemen, that I warn you that you may find the evidence of the complainant as unreliable. You are to scrutinise her evidence with great care and caution. I further warn you of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it”. 
         
        
        
       His Honour had given a similar warning at the end of that part of his summing-up which dealt with the  
       “relationship”  
       evidence. 
        
       
     52 It is to be noted in relation to his Honour’s direction on complaint that there is no express reference to delay in complaint or any reasons there for. 
      
       
     53 At what his Honour anticipated to be the conclusion of his summing-up the Crown raised the matter of delay, but principally in the context of his Honour not giving directions as to that there may have been reasons for the absence of complaint. Needless to say defence counsel was content to let the matter there rest. 
      
       
     54 Setting to one side the Crown’s application for further directions which play no part in this appeal, it cannot be said that it is easy to identify with precision what in fact counsel for the accused was seeking by way of further directions in relation to complaint. It can, however, upon my reading of the transcript, be stated that no application was made to his Honour to direct or further direct or redirect the jury in terms that the jury must consider the evidence in relation to each charge separately. A reason for that of course is that in addition to the emphasis placed upon those parts of the summing-up dealing with “relationship” evidence, extracted above, his Honour had made it clear from the opening of his summing-up that the jury needed to consider each charge separately. He reminded the jury again of this obligation when he dealt with the elements of the charges. 
      
       
     55 It seems to me that what defence counsel was seeking was an unreliability direction under s106(1) of the Evidence Act; a direction that there was nothing in the evidence as to complaints that can be linked with each charge, and a direction as to there having been no complaint until 1998 about the offence of buggery. It is to be noted that not surprisingly the complainant was not cross-examined as to this detail.  
      
       
     56 His Honour gave further directions as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Thank-you, ladies and gentlemen. First of all it was sought that I give a further direction with respect to one of the directions I gave you and that was regarding delay. You may recall I made reference to delay from the time of the first incident about 1977 through to when the witness first apprehended and it was bought to his notice some twenty-two years hence. What I failed to say to you was that the delay was – from the time of the first offence through to when the complaint was made, it is another direction that I need to give you and I propose to give it to you. You may recall that in the factual situation given by the complainant that the first offence occurred in 1977 and it was not until I think 1981 that the complaint was made and some years apart before she complained. 
         
        
        
         
         Throughout her evidence she said that she told no one and you may recall that. It was not until she had spoken with her friends that the complaint was first made. This is a direction I propose to give you. 
         
        
        
         
         You have heard evidence that on or about 1981 the complainant made a complaint to those persons, that is Jackie and Rosalyn Cole and Mrs Cole. Without going through it again, I have already highlighted it in my summing-up to you, the accused has argued that the delay by the complainant in making a complaint to a person whom she might reasonably have been expected to complain is inconsistent with the conduct of a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted. He says that you should therefore regard the complainant’s evidence that he sexually assaulted her in the way outlined as false. This is necessarily a matter which you should consider but I must warn you that the delay in making a complaint does not necessarily indicate that the evidence of the complaint is false. It may indicate fabrication on the part of the complainant but does not necessarily do so. There may be good reasons why a person who has been sexually assaulted hesitates in making a complaint. 
         
        
        
         
         It is important, however, that I give you certain warnings. It is most important that you appreciate fully the effects of the delay on the inability of the accused to defend himself by testing prosecution evidence or adducing evidence in his own case to establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt. In this regard I refer to the following specific difficulties that may be encountered by the accused in testing his evidence of the prosecution and they may include that the accused’s opportunity to obtain evidence refuting the circumstances of each alleged act was significantly impeded, as if he were unaware of dates, times and where he was, there may have been another way in which he could have run this case, that is if he was not there and he was aware of these allegations that there may have been an alibi defence. Next it also may have impeded the ability of the accused to adequately test the complainant’s evidence by the difficulty in recalling dates, times and where he may have been on those occasions. As a result of that delay in the complainant complaining, I must warn you that the evidence of the complainant is unsafe and that you must scrutinise her evidence with great care. 
         
        
        
         
         Having carefully considered the matters to which I have referred you and the warnings which I have given you, it is then a matter for you to determine what weight you should give to the complainant’s evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         Crown Prosecutor:  
         Your Honour used the word “is unsafe”, “it may be unsafe”, it is a matter for the jury. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I am sorry is – may be unsafe and Mr Crown is perfectly right, it may be unsafe and that is entirely a matter for you to determine”. 
         
        
       
     57 The first point advanced on the appeal in relation to the complaint evidence is that, notwithstanding that no objection was taken to it otherwise than on the freshness basis, his Honour should not have admitted it because it rationally could not affect the issue of the complainant’s credit, inter alia, because it was non-specific in nature. In my opinion on the face of the express statement that it would be alleged against the complainant that the whole of her testimony as to the events was a fabrication, the evidence as given, non-specific though it was vis-à-vis any particular offence, was rationally available for the jury’s consideration on the issue of the complainant’s credit. Further, in the light of the directions given during the course of the summing-up generally, and after the applications made by both sides, it could be said that the emphasis of his Honour’s summing-up as a whole was favourable to the appellant. Insofar as Rule 4 might apply to this ground of appeal, I would refuse leave, but if leave were granted, I would not be persuaded in the light of the structure of the trial and the summing-up as a whole that there had been any miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     58 The remaining submissions in relation to this aspect are unhelpful and strike me as being word-processed consequent upon a microscopic examination of the whole of the transcript without regard to the macroscopic view that this Court is entitled to take when considering the questions of miscarriage of justice in the context of a given trial. Reference is made in the written submissions to the decision of the High Court in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297. Without more it is unhelpful.  
      
       
     59 In relation to ground 8 as to the directions in fact given, no application was made to correct them in a way that conforms with the written submissions on this subject. I have made my view clear as to the overall effect of his Honour’s submissions. If Rule 4 applies I would refuse leave but otherwise I would not be persuaded that any miscarriage of justice occurred. 
      
       
     60 As to ground 9, his Honour did not give specific directions in relation to the apparent failure of the complainant to make any complaint about buggery until 1998. His Honour’s protest at defence counsel leaving it to the end of the trial to raise some issue in this regard is understandable. I do not know what, if anything, was said on this issue during the course of closing addresses. What is quite clear is that the references to the evidence by his Honour on the subject of complaint and the thrust of his summing-up generally could only be regarded as favourable. True it is that in the evidence such as it was as to complaint, it being non-specific, and especially in relation to Mrs Cole, there is not a word about buggery. What precisely his Honour was required to tell the jury is unclear. His Honour had explained to the jury as set out above the complaint evidence itself and what use could be made of it. The cross-examination of the interviewing Police Constable, Antaw, was concerned with the failure of there being any reference to a complaint to Mrs Cole and particularly the vaginal touching. Otherwise there is no specific reference, as I read the record of the proceedings, to a complaint about buggery being delayed until 1998. What there is however is the evidence of the complainant in relation to the event (the single incident) that gave rise to charges 3, 4 and 5 – indecent assault, carnal knowledge and buggery. What there was before the jury was the evidence also in relation to counts 1 and 2 (indecent assault) and count 6, the last count, the act of indecency. There was no evidence of the fact that the complainant had not complained about buggery until 1998. Was his Honour to tell the jury that? Again, I am of the view that the further directions given both before and after the applications for the directions were sufficient and indeed favourable to the accused. I cannot see any basis upon which the specific direction in relation to the late complaint of buggery in 1998 could on the evidence have been given. The subject of complaint and delay was adequately covered by his Honour as a whole by the time his summing-up concluded.  
      
       
     61 None of grounds 7, 8 and 9 has been made out. It is appropriate at this point to say, in effect, that for the same reasons ground 10 relating to the trial judge erring in failing to direct the jury that evidence admissible on one count could not be used in respect of another count has also not been made out. Much was made by counsel for the appellant on the third day of the hearing of this appeal at the end of proceedings, in the context of Rule 4, that this was so fundamental that there was no question of that Rule’s application and, further, that in some way his Honour had failed to relate “relationship” evidence to the specific act of buggery. Rule 4 applies, there was no such application made by defence counsel and the matters to which I have referred above with respect to the immediately preceding grounds of appeal adequately cover this complaint. His Honour did direct the jury that each count needed to be considered separately as I have referred to above. I agree with the submissions for the Crown that the jury, if it accepted the evidence of the earlier offences, was entitled to consider this evidence of the relationship between the parties when considering the later offences provided it did not substitute evidence of those acts for the specific act charged on the later count and reason that the appellant must be guilty on all counts. His Honour had specifically warned the jury against any such approach. I am of the view that there was no error, no miscarriage and express the same considerations as to the application of Rule 4. 
      
       
        
       Ground 11 – that the trial judge erred in admitting part of the content of documents and opinion evidence  
        
       
     62 During the evidence of the complainant a letter written by her to Rosalyn Davis was referred to. An objection was taken by defence counsel to a question from the Crown Prosecutor as to what the word “pure” in the letter meant. His Honour disallowed the question. When Mrs Davis was called to give evidence, she was examined in relation to correspondence between her and the complainant. No objection was taken by defence counsel. Here again it appears that the appellant’s case is founded upon the microscopic examination of a transcript to give rise to a point the favourable outcome of which for the appellant cannot on any rational basis lead to a view that there was a miscarriage of justice. No objection was taken to the witness being invited to express an opinion that the correspondence was directed to establishing that the complainant was no longer a virgin; no objection was taken that the evidence should not have been admitted under s78 of the Evidence Act or that s137 of the Evidence Act should have been applied. The written submissions go on to state: “In the event the trial judge gave a direction that went beyond the material given as part of complaint”. This, whatever it might mean, was not the subject of complaint after the summing-up. The letter in my view was otherwise admissible as forming part of the prior consistent statements made by the complainant to the witness Davis.  
      
       
     63 Ground 11 has not been made out and warrants no further consideration. 
      
       
        
       Ground 12 
        
       
     64 A similar view can be taken of this ground which asserts that the trial judge erred in incorrectly summarising the evidence of the witness Davis. No complaint was made. Rule 4 applies. In his summing-up his Honour said in relation to Rosalyn Davis: 
      
       
        
         
           
         “…told you that in 1981 that [the complainant] spoke to her on or about three occasions and indicated that she was assaulted by her father and that it was clear to her that he had sex with her and that it happened a number of times when she was little. Rosalyn also gave evidence that the complainant mentioned it in letters to her”. 
         
        
       
     65 In her evidence Mrs Davis said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you speak to her about this subject on more than one occasion? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Any idea how many occasions? 
          
         A. Three approximately. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she write to you about, write you any notes concerning this same thing? 
          
         A. She mentioned it in two letters. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. First of all can you tell us where you were as far as you recall when she spoke to you? 
          
         A. At her house, I was staying the night, the first time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that was fairly close to the church where you lived? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you tell us what she told you? 
          
         A. She indicated to me that she had been assaulted by her father. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she tell you how she’d been assaulted? 
          
         A. I don’t remember her exact words but she made it clear to me that he’d had sex with her. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And, did she tell you, put any time period or anything like that, or how many times it had happened or? 
          
         A. A number of times from when she was little.” 
         
        
       
     66 In the letter, Exhibit 10, mention is made by the complainant of not getting over what happened to her and not being “pure”. These were matters she had discussed with the witness in the context of what her father had done to her sexually. No re-direction was sought, as I have said, and the trial judge gave the jury the usual direction that they were the sole determiners on fact. This was a futile ground of appeal and fails. 
      
       
        
        
       Ground 13 
        
       
     67 It is contended that the trial judge erred in taking a verdict while a jury question remained unanswered.  
      
       
     68 The transcript indicates that the jury retired to consider its verdict at 2.41pm on Thursday 10 August 2001. On Friday 11 August at 9.30am it returned to hear his Honour’s negative response to the not uncommon request from a jury in cases such as this for a copy of the police statements made by the complainant. The jury retired to further consider its verdict at 9.50am. At an unspecified time a note was apparently received from the jury and marked MFI 9, which read: “Transcript of [complainant’s] evidence where buggery was alleged to have happened”. At 3.10pm the jury was brought back into court and the following exchange with the foreperson took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Good afternoon ladies and gentleman. I will have your request which I will have marked MFI 9. It reads: “Transcript of [the complainant’s] evidence where buggery was alleged to have happened”. 
         
        
        
         
         Before I come to a decision on that what I need to know is do you want all the evidence relating to buggery from the evidence-in-chief, that is, where Mr Crown asks the questions or do you want also with that the cross-examination, the questions asked by counsel for the accused. Maybe you Mr Foreperson could answer that on behalf of the jurors? 
         
        
        
         
         FOREPERSON: The evidence they are asking for your Honour is the transcript from the Crown on that alleged act. It was not discussed whether they want it from the defence, but I would imagine that it would be fair to hear that. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Sorry? 
         
        
        
         
         FOREPERSON: It would be fair to hear that from the defence as well. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: All right, so you want the evidence from the Crown in evidence-in-chief of where the buggery is referred to and the cross-examination, that is from the defence Mr Watson where he asked questions. 
         
        
        
         
         FOREPERSON: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Having said that what I will do is I will ask you to go back now with the sheriff’s officer to the jury room and then I will have the transcript sent around to you and that should not be too long.” 
         
        
        
       The jury then retired further to consider its verdict at 3.12pm. There was further discussion, as far I can understand it from the transcript, as to what would constitute the material to be provided in answer to the jury’s enquiry. Arrangements were made for the preparation of that material and a short adjournment was taken. After that his Honour indicated that he had received another note from the jury that it had reached a verdict. That verdict was delivered at 4.02pm and the jury was discharged at 4.05pm.  
        
       
     69 There is a threshold difficulty with this ground of appeal. It is simply not known if the jury received the transcript in answer to its enquiry. It is a guess as to whether it did or did not. It was submitted for the appellant that the enquiry indicated that one, some, or all members of the jury were concerned about the evidence in relation to the buggery charge. How they viewed the evidence or lack of evidence in respect of that charge, it was submitted, was bound to affect how they viewed her evidence in relation to the other charges. It was then submitted that there were obvious pressures on the jury late on a Friday afternoon to bring in a verdict, pressures which were said to be “obvious” and which might lead to one or more jurors voting against their own held view of the evidence. It was submitted that his Honour should have refused to have taken a verdict in such circumstances. It was further submitted in reply to the Crown submissions that there was an obvious and clear danger of the jury “abandoning its concerns as the winter Friday afternoon progressed”. 
      
       
     70 In written submissions reference is made to three cases the first of which is Regina v CJ Knight (NSWCCA, unreported 18 December, 1990, Hunt, Wood and McInerney JJ) in which it was held that it was an unsatisfactory and undesirable practice for the jury formally to be asked to retire to consider its verdict before the trial judge had dealt with any requests for redirection. That case is not applicable here. The jury merely asked to be provided with some evidentiary material. The second authority which is listed in the appellant’s written submissions is Regina v McCormack (1995) 85 A Crim R 445. That was another instance of a jury being asked formally to retire to consider its verdict before the settlement of further directions was reached. The jury however in that trial was further directed and then returned its verdict a short time after the further directions. In the circumstances of that appeal a new trial was ordered in relation to the count upon which the appellant was convicted. The general principle was articulated on the judgment of Mahoney P: 
      
       
        
         
         “Those cases indicate the dangers in asking a jury to consider their verdict before all directions have been given. A trial judge should, as a general principle, ensure that no further directions are to be sought or given before he asks the jury to consider their verdict…It is possible that, in the exigencies of a trial this cannot be ensured, but a judge should take positive steps by inquiry of counsel and otherwise to prevent such problems arising.  
         
        
        
         
         However, I do not accept that the fact alone that a jury has been invited to consider their verdict before the summing-up has been completed involves in all cases a miscarriage of the trial. It is important that, when a jury considers its verdict, it does so upon a proper basis. It is a general principle that what a jury does is what appears from what publicly it says: a jury is not to be improperly interrogated as to what it did nor should inferences be drawn as to when or how it arrived at its verdict upon the basis of uncertain inferences. But, in my opinion, the function of principles of this kind and of the formalities which are based upon them is relevantly to ensure that the accused has a trial which is fair and in accordance with law. A failure to comply with such principles or formalities should not defeat a verdict where it is proper to assume that the purpose of them has been achieved; conversely, if that does not so appear, or there is an appropriate degree of doubt as to what occurred, a verdict arrived at upon the basis of a wrong direction on a matter of substance should not stand”. 
           
          
         
        
       
     71 The next authority to which reference is made in written submissions is Regina v Salama [1999] NSWCCA 105 (10 May 1999). The circumstances, and peculiar they are, attending this aspect of the appeal can be revealed by quoting from the judgment of Kirby J (at paragraphs [67] to [72]): 
      
       
         
        
        
         
         [67] …The appellant complains that his Honour failed to answer a question which the jury had posed before it delivered its verdict. Simpson J in  
         Crisologo 
          referred to the insight that might be provided by ""external indicators of compromise"" (at 7). There may also be external indicators of confusion. Here, there was an episode which, arguably, suggested confusion, at least on the part of some members of the jury. The jury, having retired, later sent a note which posed a question in these terms:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ""In regard to the second or alternative charge your instruction to us was to have pulled the trigger deliberately with disregard for Alice Salama. The charge on the indictment states 'Did fire a firearm with disregard for safety of Alice Salama'. Does this include accidentally?""  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         [68] Whilst the question was being debated with counsel, a second note was sent by the jury a short time later. The jury returned to the courtroom. The transcript recorded what then occurred:  
          
           
            
            
           ""HIS HONOUR: Thank you members of the Jury. Members of the Jury I have your note which I have in fact read to counsel, and I now have a later note which indicates 'Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. Please disregard the question previously sent in.'  
            
           I think in the circumstances I will ask my associate to take that verdict from you before proceeding.  
            
            
           NICHOLSON: I would ask the question be first answered.  
            
            
           HIS HONOUR: No, I am going to deal with it this way, Mr Nicholson.  
            
            
           JURY RETURNED WITH A VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY TO THE FIRST CHARGE AT 3.34 PM.  
            
            
           JURY RETURNED WITH A VERDICT OF GUILTY TO ALTERNATIVE CHARGE AT 3.34 PM.  
            
            
           HIS HONOUR: I think in the circumstances members of the Jury, before accept(ing) this verdict from you I should deal with the questions which you have put to me, and I will read those two questions.""  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
         [69] His Honour then read the questions. He repeated the instructions he had given as to the elements of the second count, including that the firing must be deliberate. He did not answer the question as such. There was no reference to ""accident"".  
          
          
         [70] The jury was sent out again at 3.36 pm. It returned at 3.42 pm with the same verdict, namely, guilty on the alternative charge.  
          
          
         [71] The first note, on its face, betrayed confusion. The confusion went to the heart of the charge. Notwithstanding the jury's apparent resolution of the issue to their own satisfaction, it was important that the question be answered. It was also important that they should then deliberate further in the light of that answer. Once the verdict was delivered, the opportunity to answer the question, and instruct the jury, was lost. After verdict, the obligation was to immediately discharge the jury…It was not open to the judge to interrogate the jury as to the grounds for its decision… 
          
          
         [72] Although what occurred was irregular, it is apparent that an issue arose in his Honour's mind as to whether the jury had understood the directions which had been given. Hence, the directions were given for a second time. Failure to answer the question before the verdict was, in my view, an error justifying a new trial.  
         
        
        
         
        
       It is interesting to note two things about the factual circumstances in  
       Salama 
       . First, the jury politely informed the court that there was no need for the question to be answered because it had reached a verdict and secondly, perhaps more importantly, that the question in fact asked by the jury was a request for further directions.  
        
       
     72 In these cases it can be seen that within the framework of the matter of principle referred to by Mahoney P in McCormack: (a) a jury should not formally be asked to retire to consider its verdict until all applications for further directions have been dealt with conclusively; (b) in circumstances where the jury asks a question that indicates that further directions as to law are required and which indicates some uncertainty in the corporate state of mind of that tribunal, the trial judge should ensure that no verdict is taken before that question is answered; (c) where the jury, as in this case, merely asks to be reminded of evidence (and assuming that the reminder was not in practical terms given to it) the verdict of the jury given in the absence of that reminder should be respected.  
      
       
     73 As the authorities indicate, each case will depend on its own circumstances. It might be appropriate for a trial judge to give consideration, in his opening remarks to the jury when in the normal course the jury’s right to ask questions is referred to, indicating that if the jury changes its mind it should inform the court. It might well be that in situation (c) an available course would be, before accepting the verdict, for the judge to send in a note to the effect that it is assumed that the jury no longer requires to be reminded of the evidence, a step which will, no doubt, generate a response. Great care must be taken, as the authorities indicate, not to seize upon any question asked by a jury as a justification for taking steps that will in fact amount to, or could be perceived to be, an intrusion into the deliberative process of that body. 
      
       
     74 In the circumstances of this appeal I am not persuaded by any argument raised for the appellant that the question and its not being answered (if that be the case) points to any irregularity that could constitute a miscarriage of justice. The submissions’ reference to meteorological and calendar considerations warrants no comment. Ground 13 fails. 
      
       
        
        
       Ground 3 
        
       
     75 I return to this ground which contends that the trial Judge erred in ruling on 31 July 2000 that if the appellant raised character the prosecution was entitled to cross-examine him in respect to other allegations.  
      
       
     76 This was the ground principally argued on the three occasions the appeal was listed for hearing. It involved the consideration of the transcript, in the first instance, of the proceedings before his Honour the trial Judge on 31 July 2000 on the occasion when the matter was raised. I set it out in full. 
      
       
        
         
         “WATSON: Your Honour, there is one other thing: I have provided your Honour and my friend with copies of two cases regarding seeking 110 ruling. I will be asking your Honour to rule on this point. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Mr Watson, I’m not sure what’s going on in this case. I understood that you weren’t going to pursue it, but you’re now going too pursue it, are you?

         : Yes. 
          
          
         SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
          
          
         WATSON: Your Honour, this is an application for a ruling concerning, or pursuant to s 110 of the Evidence Act, concerning the accused’s character. Your Honour, in a nutshell the accused was a person without any criminal antecedents or record up until the time he was charged. I’d be seeking a ruling from your Honour as regards the use of what the defence says is the limited good character of the accused in the light of the allegations that he’s now facing with the three back to back trials. Your Honour is well aware that there are three back to back trials concerning allegations concerning three daughters of the accused and those allegations reign over a period of years, well before he was charged with any of the offences involved in the three back to back trials. Provided to your Honour the authorities of  
         R v PKS 
         , a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal dated 1 October 1998, together with a decision of the same Court,  
         R v Robinson  
         [2000] NSWCCA 59 and those cases detail what I would call the use of limited –well, certainly what I would call an application by the defence to use the good character of an accused in a limited fashion with the appropriate pre-trial application being made as the case may be. The situation would be that in this case an application would be made that the prosecution witness, probably the informant, would be asked whether the accused had a criminal record prior to being charged on this offence, and I would anticipate that he would say, no. And that is a method that is promoted in the authorities that the actual formation of how the evidence would be adduced would be put before a trial judge for consideration, therefore ensuring that there’d be no opening if – well, no possibility of any opening for cross-examination after the ruling is made. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: That’s the standard, isn’t it? I can’t allow the cross-examination unless leave’s sought? 
          
          
         WATSON: That’s correct. All I’m asking - the application is that the informant would be asked about the accused’s antecedents. He would say that there are no antecedents - - 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: just tell me, first of all, where under the Evidence Act that I can do that and where in these cases say that I can do that - that is allowed - - 
          
          
         WATSON: You’ve got a discretion - -  
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: --that character evidence – limited character evidence to be given without the Crown being able to call those witnesses he seeks to. Just take me to it. I understand what your application is. What I’m after is you show me the authorities that say you can do what you want to do. 
          
          
         WATSON: You have a discretion under – it’s s137 and 137. Leave an be refused for the Crown to cross-examine under s122. While the authorities provided to you - - 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Just take me straight to the point that you want to rely on. 
          
          
         WATSON:  
         PKS 
         , your Honour. If I can take you to page 4, where you will see the paragraph, ground 1, and it says: “…pursuant to s110 of the Evidence Act ….other children including his own.” 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: The piece you just read, how does that fit in? 
          
          
         WATSON: Well, that’s in the case your Honour. The thing that affected the appellant in  
         PKS 
          was that he had offences for theft. Now, the thing is, certainly there are allegations and the application here is that while –certainly there are allegations, my submission is that there’s a limited use of his good character only to the point that what would be coming before the court is that as at the time he was charged he was a different person without any criminal record. So it is a different situation to  
         PKS 
          certainly and the distinction - -  
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I understood limited good character, and I might be completely wrong, but my understanding of it is this, that if someone is charged with sexual offences, let’s use that charge, and if he has a record which includes say theft matters, now the limited part is you can show, you can say to the jury, “Well, look his record indicates these theft matters but his record with respect to sexual assault matters, or sexual offences, is none. He’s got no prior history of it.” But what you’re trying to do here, isn’t it, it’s something a little different in that you say, “Well, look his record’s clear”, but how does that stop the Crown from raising or calling witnesses to say “He’s done this to me in the past and this has happened”, these are all sexual - -  
          
          
         WATSON: Firstly, the Crown consented to separate trials and that in effect would be running all the material through the issue of character if the Crown wished to do it that way. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: No, I can’t understand that. Whether the Crown consented to separate trials or not, the Crown’s still, aren’t they, entitled to say, “this is what’s gone on in the past”. And the Crown’s saying to you, “if you don’t raise good character, then we don’t pursue the other issue”. I’m not really - maybe I’m missing the point here. 
          
          
         WATSON: The distinction between these cases is that there were convictions, whereas what the current accused is facing are allegations. 
          
          
         Crown Prosecutor: 
          That’s not quite right what my friend says, these cases. If your Honour goes to - in relation to the other case,  
         Robinson 
         , if your Honour goes to paragraph 42 and 43, it’s really in a nutshell there. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Yes, that’s right, and I’ve marked there that as well, and it was already marked but I marked it again. 
          
          
         Crown Prosecutor: 
          They’re outstanding trials, outstanding complaints, same situation. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: What’s your view of that, Mr Watson? 
          
          
         WATSON: Only this, your Honour, the application is only this, that it’s not a proposal to have Mr [B]’s character put forward as good in general or good in any respect to – as it says in paragraph 43, “put forward good character in general or in the particular sexual respect”, its only that the – the only area that this application concerns is that prior to the charges, this man had no criminal record; its as simple as that. 
          
          
         Crown Prosecutor 
         : What does it go to? 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I think that’s a pertinent question, what does it go to? 
          
          
         WATSON: It goes to the history prior to the date of the charge as far as the authority - the police is concerned. 
          
          
          
          CROWN PROSECUTOR: I don’t understand - is my friend then going to say he’s entitled to the twofold direction on character which he’s unlikely to commit a sexual assault offence; unlikely to commit this offence? As I understand the basis of the limited way which your Honour has described, which they refer to in the other cases where they were - quite obviously they were larceny matters, when he was eighteen, nineteen or twenty which he got bonds for, quite obviously because they’re talking about the limitation, the fifteen year limitation, so I don’t – perhaps if my friend could indicate what he seeks – what direction he seeks from your Honour - -  
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: If this were to be raised. Yes, what are you seeking that I should say to the jury? 
          
          
         WATSON: It would only be this, that prior to the accused being charge with this matter, he had not come to the attention of the authorities. 
          
          
         Crown Prosecutor: 
          In what way can they use it? 
          
          
         WATSON: They’re my submissions, your Honour. 
          
          
         Crown Prosecutor 
         : Your Honour, in relation to that, the normal thing means that your Honour would have to give a direction (a) whether he’s going to be believed. The question then, unlikely to commit this type of offence. My friend just says, “no, I just want this evidence” and doesn’t formulate any direction what he wants. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR:  
         Mr Crown, you don’t need to say anything further. I rule against you, I’m against your application, Mr Watson, and I won’t allow it, as it has been put to me. So it is up to you to decide whether you want to still pursue it and the Crown is entitled to call the evidence he wishes to. 
          
          
         WATSON: No, I’ve heard your Honour and the application sought to indicate to your Honour that the application was only on a slim point and I’ve heard your Honour. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I could understand, as I’ve said earlier, I could understand if he had some convictions on his record, but not the ones that he’s being pursued in Court. I could say something with respect to that. That’s not the situation here; it’s nowhere - nothing like it”. (emphasis added) 
          
          
         
        
       
     77 The issue is whether or not his Honour conclusively ruled against the accused on his counsel’s application, whether his Honour was in error in doing so and, if so, whether there was a miscarriage. 
      
       
     78 When the matter was relisted before this Court on 1 March 2002 affidavits by trial counsel, Christopher John Watson, sworn 21 February 2002 and of the Crown, Bruce Kelly, sworn 8 February 2002, were read.79 In his affidavit Mr Watson said that he had indicated to the Crown in pre-trial discussion a proposal that limited character could be adduced on the appellant’s behalf that prior to the appellant being charged concerning the present complainant he had been a person of good character. He recalled that on 31 July he made an application for a ruling concerning the use of character evidence in this fashion. He swears to “making a definite application” to the trial Judge for his ruling on whether character evidence of a limited nature could be raised in the trial without the Crown being able to bring evidence in rebuttal or to cross-examine the appellant. Mr Watson confirms in his affidavit that which is disclosed by the transcript - that he had referred the trial Judge to the decision of this Court in Regina v PKS (NSWCCA, unreported 1 October 1998) and Regina v Robinson [2000] NSWCCA 59. Mr Watson accepted the ruling set out above as the trial Judge’s final ruling on the question and that his Honour had rejected the application.80 The Crown Prosecutor deposes as to his recollection of a conversation with trial counsel prior to what is described as the “first aborted trial” the effect of which was that in response to any raising of good character by the accused the Crown would seek to call two other complainants. Annexed to Mr Kelly’s affidavit are statements of the present complainant and the two other complainants. In relation to the two other complainants there is some uncertainty as to whether one of the statements was in fact tendered on what clearly was the voir dire his Honour was conducting.81 The affidavits referred to were directed to be filed upon the Crown suggesting that the defence counsel for tactical reasons had decided not to pursue further what was available to be understood as an interim ruling only on the part of the trial Judge.82 It seems quite clear to me, from the text of the transcript set out above and emphasised, that his Honour did conclusively rule against the accused and I accept that thereafter defence counsel reasonably understood the ruling to be final.83 I am reinforced in my view as to the finality of the “ruling” by an incident that occurred during the trial appealed from but which was not subject of reference during the course of the hearing of the appeal. On 8 August 2000 the defence counsel was cross-examining the accused’s witness Ms Freeman. The following exchange took place:  
      
       
        
         
         “Q. What’s your opinion of the type of quality of the relationship that existed between [C] - - 
          
          
         OBJECTION. 
          
          
         IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
          
          
         OBJECTION CONTINUED: (Crown indicated that counsel was raising character. His Honour indicated that he would let the evidence continue, but indicated to Mr Watson to be very mindful of that; that he, Mr Watson, was right on the borderline with respect to character and may have in fact gone over the line. 
          
          
         Mr Watson asked that the witness wait outside during discussion. Crown indicated that the witness needed to stay to hear what she cannot say. Discussion ensued.) 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I am going to allow you to continue your questioning, but if you go anywhere near asking a question that looks like breaching it, and Mr Crown objects to it, I will just rule it straight out and I will not even let her answer it. We will do it that way”. 
         
        
       
     84 Thus the question of its correctness and, if incorrect, whether there has been a miscarriage of justice must now be considered.85 Notwithstanding the availability of the view that finality attended his Honour’s “ruling”, there is difficulty identifying the “context” in which it was made. So much as this can be understood: that counsel for the accused was seeking something in relation to his client being of good character – no convictions – up until the time the charges were laid. Further, it can be understood, by reason of counsel’s citing to his Honour the cases referred to above, that there was an understanding of the availability to the Crown of the other complainant’s evidence to rebut good character. Further it can be understood that his Honour had the statements of the other complainants and was sensitive to what he perceived to be the right of the Crown to call such evidence and no doubt the risk to the accused if it were to be called. Otherwise, there was lack of clarity in whatever it was that defence counsel was seeking to articulate. Further, it is clear that his Honour was sensitive to the requirement that he would have to tell the jury something in the light of what can be understood as his Honour’s understanding of what was being put to him, but no assistance was forthcoming from counsel. 86 In this general context, as I perceive it, complaint is made that his Honour failed to consider the possibility of concoction on the part of the complainant and her sisters; failed to consider what is said to be the lack of cogency in the evidence of the sisters’ potential evidence; failed to consider whether cross-examination in respect of the other allegations would amount to seeking to establish propensity; failed to consider the discretionary bases for the exclusion of such evidence pursuant to ss135 and 137 of the Evidence Act; failed to consider the requirements for leave under s112 of the Evidence Act  and the accompanying provisions in s 192. His Honour was dealing with whatever application it was that defence counsel was making in the context of a voir dire - statements of the other complainants had been tendered. This Court has the benefit of all the statements and an extract from the committal proceedings with a view to determining whether any miscarriage took place. Further, this Court has the advantage from its perspective of knowing (contrary to the understanding of counsel at trial) that the vulnerability of the accused was affected by the fact that he did have prior convictions for dishonesty many years previously, and the availability of the evidence of the other complaints.87 His Honour was rightly concerned as to what he was supposed to tell the jury on the assumption that the accused had come under no notice prior to the making of the complaints the subject of the trial. The matter achieved, upon any reading of the transcript set out above, a degree of circularity. That quality of the submissions being made to the trial Judge in the end of course brought it about that his Honour had no occasion to consider the question of leave to the Crown under s112 and the considerations affecting the grant of such leave as provided for by s192 of the Evidence Act. (It is to be noted that there is no reference in the written submissions to s110).88 In paragraph 7 of his affidavit Mr Watson states: “I was making a definite application to the Judge for his ruling on whether character evidence of a limited nature could be raised without the Crown being permitted to bring evidence in rebuttal or to cross-examine the appellant”.89 The decision in Robinson had been referred to by defence counsel and defence counsel stated to his Honour: “The application is only this, that it is not a proposal to have [TAB’s] character put forward as good in general, or in any respect to - as it says in paragraph 43 ‘put forward good character in general or in the particular sexual respect’, it’s only that the only area this application concerns is that prior to the charges, this man had no criminal record; it’s a simple as that”.90 With respect, Mr Watson’s affidavit does not really clarify the nature of the application he made “in that limited way”. No doubt defence counsel was conscious of what Barr J has said in his judgment in Robinson: paragraphs 42 and 43.  
      
       
        
         
         “ If defence counsel had put forward a properly formulated proposal to raise good character in general or in the particular respect, for example that the appellant was not guilty of sexual misconduct against young children, and the Crown had been required to make available or make known what material it would wish to bring forward, the trial judge would have been obliged to indicate what evidence if any the Crown might be permitted to adduce. That stage was never reached and the trial judge was not in error. 
          
          
         It would appear from what this Court has been told that at the time of trial a number of allegations of sexual assaults upon other complainants were outstanding against the appellant. It seems highly probable, therefore, that if the appellant had put forward good character in general or in the particular sexual respect I have mentioned, the Crown would have been permitted to prove his sexual assaults on other children. To have conducted this trial otherwise would have allowed the appellant to be presented to the jury falsely as a man of unblemished character in the relevant respect”. 
         
        
       
     91 It seems clear that in response to submissions by the Crown and the question put by the trial Judge as to the relevance of the proposed evidence of lack of any prior convictions if it did not relate to general or specific character, counsel for the accused said: “It goes to the history prior to the date of the charges as far as the authority – the police - is concerned [sic]”. As mentioned above, his Honour specifically asked counsel, in relation to the evidence, what was to be told to the jury about it. Defence counsel responded as indicated above that “prior to the accused being charged with this matter, he had not come to the attention of the authorities.” 92 The Crown Prosecutor then said the words attributed to him as set out above whereupon his Honour made the “ruling”.93 The record of the pre-trial voir dire discloses use by the acccused’s counsel of phrases such as: “limited good character of the accused”; “a limited use of his good character only to the extent that what would be coming before the court is as at the time he was charged he was a person without any criminal record”; “ on a slim point”. Nothing in the affidavit filed by Mr Watson amplifies this aspect.94 S110 of the Evidence Act makes no reference to “limited” evidence of good character. S110(1) refers to evidence that the defendant is “either generally, or in a particular respect, a person of good character”. Ss(2) refers to “evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is generally a person of good character”; ss(3) refers to “evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is a person of good character in a particular respect”. As the Crown submitted in this appeal, evidence that an accused person has no previous convictions commonly forms part of a defence case that the accused is generally a person of good character. Evidence that a person had no convictions for the particular type of offence in respect of which he is on trial generally forms part of a defence case that he is a person of good character “in a particular respect”. Whilst defence counsel did initially put to the trial Judge that the application was being made pursuant to s110 of the Evidence Act “concerning the accused’s character”. It appears however to me that that application so framed (whatever it meant) was resiled from when Mr Watson said: “The application is only this, that it is not a proposal to have [TAB]’s character put forward as good in general, or in any respect to – as it says in paragraph 3 - ‘put forward good character in general or in the particular sexual respect’ (from Robinson) it is only that the only area that this application concerns is that prior to the charges this man had no criminal record; its as simple as that”.95 This as I have already said points to, at the very least, circularity and in the end points to there being no occasion on which his Honour was invited by a specifically articulated application for directions as to whether the appellant was a person of good character either generally or in relation to his behaviour in a particular respect and thus the occasion did not arise for the trial Judge to make any rulings as to the admissibility of the appellant’s sexual misconduct with other complainants. This the Crown argued on appeal and as for myself I am persuaded by it. 96 As I have intimated above, it is my view that to make the “application” was a tactical decision on the part of defence counsel. Confused and circular as the application appears to have been, I am persuaded that defence counsel, in the light of his Honour’s remarks both on 31 July and on the second occasion to which I have referred, could well have formed the view that the matter was closed. Thus no question arises as to a subsequent “tactical” decision taken by counsel but rather one focussed on whether there was any miscarriage of justice in the extraordinary and unfortunate circumstances in which his Honour made the “ruling”. 97 Insofar as the original application made by defence counsel at trial related to the appellant, prior to the charges being laid, having come under no adverse or authority notice, it can be now seen that that application was misconceived. It is quite clear that at the time neither the Crown nor the defence were aware of two old convictions in Queensland. Both trial counsel were mistaken as to the true position regarding the appellant’s antecedents. From paragraph 4 of Mr Watson’s affidavit it is clear that even had he known he would have made the application. He would have done so because the matters were “old”.98 Pursuant to the Criminal Records Act 1991 the appellant’s Queensland convictions were spent convictions by reason of more than 10 years having elapsed since their date (s9). That Act (s6) applies to offences, convictions and courts outside of New South Wales as well as to matters occurring within the jurisdiction. S12 of the Act provides that spent convictions need not be disclosed in a number of circumstances. However s16(1) states: “s12 does not apply to proceedings before a court (including the giving of evidence) or the making of a decision by a court (including a decision concerning sentence)”. The situation is not dissimilar to that in PKS where the joint judgment recognised that the defence would not have been able to elicit evidence of general good character in the Crown case by cross-examining the police officer as to lack of previous convictions merely because the appellant had old convictions. 99 The fact of the matter is that in the present case, as it was conducted, the jury received no such evidence. Had an officer been asked the questions defence counsel wished to ask and have given a negative response (that is, no convictions) the evidence would have been false and misleading. As it turns out it would be impossible on any retrial for that kind of evidence to be led by cross-examining the police officer.100 The curious situation therefore is reached whereby the appellant is complaining about being precluded from leading evidence the true nature of which was unknown to both sides and in circumstances where on any notional new trial (or indeed, had it been known, at the original trial) the evidence could not be elicited for the stated purpose. It is to be further observed that had any notional inquiry been embarked upon as to the status of the old convictions, evidence of them could have been given under s16 of the Criminal Records Act.  The administration of justice cannot permit a clear deception of a jury as to the facts (see PKS at p 10). In these circumstances, in my view, there can be no miscarriage of justice when such an end was obviated by what in fact occurred and which clearly could not be achieved on any notional new trial.101 The second curious aspect of the appellant’s complaint about what occurred in relation to the application as to character evidence, is that in the end, of course, that which was otherwise be sought to be excluded (namely the evidence of the other complainants) in fact was not heard during the course of the trial. 102 The Crown submitted that it is doubtful since the decision of the High Court in BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275 whether the decision in Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292 makes evidence tendered to rebut good character inadmissible because of a reasonable possibility of collusion. The Crown further argues that to the extent that the decision of this Court in Regina v Wheeler (unreported, NSWCCA, 16 November 1989) decides otherwise, it is wrongly decided. The Crown nonetheless acknowledges that the discretion available, according to the Crown pursuant to s135 of the Evidence Act, would of course still apply. This last mentioned proposition was considered by this Court in R v OGD [No 2] (2000) 50 NSWLR 433. In OGD it was stated that Hoch enunciated a rule that similar fact evidence is inadmissible unless (the onus being upon the Crown) the trial Judge is satisfied that there is no real possibility of concoction after embarking upon a genuine fact-finding exercise in which evidence, if considered necessary or appropriate, can be adduced from the witness from whom the Crown seeks to adduce the similar fact evidence, and in which the focus of inquiry is on the factual (as distinct from theoretical) possibility of concoction (see OGD at 441-2 per Simpson J). It was further held in OGD that where there is evidence capable of disclosing a tendency on behalf on an accused person (whether or not it is tendered for that purpose) and the Crown fails to exclude the reasonable possibility of concoction on the part of the witness or witnesses, that evidence must be excluded, not because of the rule in Hoch but because of the statutory requirement to weigh the probative value of such evidence against its prejudicial effect set out, in the case of evidence to show tendency, in s101(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 and in the case of evidence not tendered for that purpose (that is, as I understand it, evidence tendered to rebut good character) set out in ss135 and 137 of that Act. All that Hoch does is provide guidance for the exercise of the discretion to exclude evidence covered by s135(a) of the Evidence Act and the evaluative process which may lead to the obligation to exclude evidence set out in s137 of the Evidence Act because of the requirement to weigh probative value against prejudicial effect (see Simpson J at 445-448). As Simpson J observed in OGD (paragraph [75] at 447) it may now no longer be necessary to decide whether Wheeler represents the correct approach.103 In BRS the High Court was concerned with a trial in which the evidence of another complainant was admitted without objection by the defence on the basis that it was perceived as being admissible on the question of character only which had clearly been raised during the course of the trial. In the end, however, the evidence was relied upon by the Crown, not merely to rebut evidence of good character, but as corroborative of the evidence of the particular complainant. In that context it is interesting to note that Gaudron J (at 298) commenced a substantial portion of her judgment: “Leaving aside the situation in which character is in issue, evidence that an accused person has on other occasions committed other offences is admissible only in strictly limited circumstances…” which her Honour then identifies and discusses. At 300 her Honour notes one other matter. “It is axiomatic that, in cases such as the present, where evidence of conduct on other occasions is tendered in proof of the objective improbability of concoction, that evidence is not admissible unless the possibility of concoction has been excluded. That possibility must be explored before the evidence is admitted – by means of a voir dire, if necessary. That course was not adopted in this case, doubtless because the view was taken that W’s evidence was admissible to counter the character evidence to be called in the defence case. … Assuming W’s evidence otherwise possessed the requisite probative force or cogency, the possibility of concoction should have been explored by the trial Judge in the absence of the jury if it was to be left to the jury as direct evidence of the appellant’s guilt” that is, as I understand her Honour, as evidence of the guilt of the appellant, as evidence corroborative of it, in addition to being evidence to rebut character. Thus it is that her Honour said (at 302): “ In the circumstances of this case the jury should have been instructed that W’s evidence could only be used to counter evidence of the appellant’s good character, to weaken his credibility and to corroborate the account given by H…” (emphasis added)104 The factual basis of BRS was further referred to by McHugh J (at 303): 
      
       
        
         
         “It was common ground at the trial that  
         W’s evidence was admissible because it rebutted evidence that the appellant was a person of good character 
         . In his summing up, the learned trial Judge referred to the evidence of good character called on behalf of the appellant. His Honour instructed the jurors that they must take that evidence into account on the question of guilt and in assessing the reliability of the appellant’s denials of the offences. However, the learned Judge made no reference at any stage of his summing-up to the evidence of W”.  
         (emphasis added) 
         
        
        
       McHugh J then goes on (at 304) to identify the failure of the trial Judge to give directions in relation to the evidence of W in the context where the Crown Prosecutor, for example, had relied upon W’s evidence as corroborating part of the complainant’s evidence - that is more than being called in rebuttal of good character. This is by no means an exhaustive analysis of the judgments of the High Court in  
       BRS 
        - that is not necessary in my view. The judgment of Gaudron J was referred to, and as I understand it, relied upon by counsel for the appellant particularly in relation to the requirement of a voir dire. So far as the present ground of appeal is concerned, it is to be kept in mind that  
       BRS 
        was concerned with a failure to give directions in the context of the structure of a trial in which evidence in fact had been admitted (and by consent) but the use of which had been advanced by the Crown beyond mere rebuttal of character to the point of reliance on it for corroboration. Nothing of course like that happened in this case.  
       
     105 The Crown usefully, in written submissions in reply, summarised the evidence available to it from the other complainants, to argue that there was no possibility of concoction. There is no need to further elaborate, as the exercise is academic.106 The conclusion to which I have come may be summarised thus: first, Rule 4 does not apply. I accept the position of the appellant that his Honour did give a final ruling binding upon the appellant and no tactical considerations entered into his counsel taking no further step in relation to the “character” evidence. Second, insofar as the appellant sought to adduce evidence that prior to the present charges he was not known to the authorities, as is now known, that evidence simply would not have been available (and will not be available in any notional retrial) and the situation whereby a jury might have been misled was thereby obviated. Third, insofar as the appellant contends that he was, at trial, by reason of his Honour’s ruling, precluded from testing on a more expanded voir dire than that which in fact took place, the evidence of the other complainants, and testing it with a view to having that evidence excluded, the evidence was not in any event given. Taking into account the peculiar matter of the antecedents, this ground of appeal boils down to no more than the appellant complaining of being deprived of the opportunity to have excluded evidence which was not in fact called. 107 Assuming that the due formality of a full voir dire was required (as per Gaudron J in BRS in respect to which I have some reservations as to its application here) his Honour did not conduct such a voir dire. It must be added of course that none appears to have been sought in the sense of the other complainants being required for cross-examination, and further, that must be viewed in the context of the shifting of position and other unsatisfactory general forensic state of affairs, which attended the making of the application on 31 July. As I have said, his Honour did not conduct a voir dire; the point was not reached where leave was required; the point was not reached where his Honour was clearly directed to be concerned with s110 of the Evidence Act; or with s112 and s192; and the point was not reached where his Honour may have been called upon to exercise his discretion under s137. The furthest I am prepared to go in this area as to the trial Judge being in error is to say that the circumstances in which his Honour in fact ruled were unusual and indeed undesirable. It is the outcome however which is critical: in the end the jury did not hear the dangerous evidence of the two other complainants. In the end, that which defence counsel sought to have established, namely the absence of “antecedents” was, as a matter of fact, not available. In those circumstances I cannot see any basis for concluding that the accused was in some way deprived of a basis for acquittal or that there was any miscarriage of justice.108 Ground 3 fails. 
      
       
        
       Leave to appeal against sentence 
        
       
     109 With respect to Counts 1, 2 and 5 (indecent assault) his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for two years to date from 11 August 2000. In respect of Count 3 (carnal knowledge) his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for 4 years to commence on 11 August 2000. With respect to Count 4 (buggery) his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for seven years to commence on 11 August 2000 and fixed a non-parole period of four years (to expire on 10 August 2004). In respect of count 6 (act of indecency) his Honour imposed a fixed term of nine months to commence on 11 August 2000. The appellant applies for leave to appeal against the asserted severity of the total sentences and particularly the sentence for buggery which is contended to have been unduly harsh and severe. 
      
       
     110 It is submitted that his Honour fell into error in accepting as a basis for imposing a lengthy sentence the contention of the Crown that the community’s concerns over sexual molestation of children by adults has been acknowledged in legislation by providing increased penalties when the victims are under the age of 16 years. It is further submitted that the offender was entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the law at the time the offences were committed in terms of the statutes and penalties imposed. The submissions go on further to state that “anecdotal” evidence would suggest that the penalties would have been outside the range at the time the offences were said to have been committed (see now, Regina v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129). Without additional submissions or material from counsel as to sentence range and/or in relation to either repealed or other relevant statutory provisions as to statutory maximums, it seems to me that this submission cannot succeed. In relation to counts 1, 2 and 5 they were laid under s76 of the Crimes Act which provided a maximum of six years as his Honour stated; both the carnal knowledge charge and the buggery charge laid under the then relevant s73 and s79 of the Crimes Act carried maximum penalties of fourteen years. Count 6 laid under s 61E(2) carried a maximum penalty of two years. I see no error therefore in this approach by his Honour.  
      
       
     111 It is next contended that his Honour failed to take into account the “staleness” of the offences. Reference was of course made to the decision of this Court in Regina v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517. In sexual cases it is impossible to lay down any general principle as to the operation of leniency arising from delay as I said in Regina v JR Thompson (unreported, NSWCCA 18 June 1996) where I discussed relevant authorities. I think it appropriate that great caution be exercised in applying the word “stale” to offences of this kind, the more so in a context where there was evidence of a complaint made in general terms about the conduct at the time of the course of the offences and notwithstanding a late formal complaint to the authorities. These are extremely sensitive matters to which the word “stale” in my view is not appropriate. That does not mean of course that a Court should not, in sentencing, or in reviewing a sentence, take into account, if it is appropriate to be taken into account, evidence of “substantial rehabilitation” as mitigating: Regina v JR Thompson (unreported, NSWCCA 18 June 1996). 
      
       
     112 His Honour’s remarks on sentence are thorough, detailed, and well structured. His Honour paid particular regard, as he must, to the objective gravity of the offences, the course of time over which they were committed and the relationship between father and daughter. His Honour expressly had regard to the requirement of general deterrence in circumstances such as this, relying on what was said by Sully and Ireland JJ in Regina v Hudson (NSWCCA, unreported, 30 July 1998).  
      
       
     113 With respect to his Honour’s findings as to the facts and the objective gravity of the offences for which the applicant stood for sentence, I can find no basis for reasonable complaint as to his Honour’s approach. 
      
       
     114 It is argued that his Honour gave insufficient weight to the plaintiff’s age, health, good character and the fact that this was the first time that the applicant would be serving a custodial sentence. The last mentioned proposition is implicit in his Honour sentencing the applicant on the basis of a person of prior good character (ignoring the old offences for dishonesty). His Honour had particular regard to the applicant’s age. He did have regard to and gave him the benefit of his prior good character. He did so in a way that afforded that component of the subjective case appropriate weight. Nothing that the High Court have said in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 179 ALR 193 inclines me to the view that his Honour was in any way in error in this regard. His Honour took account of the prisoner’s subjective circumstances in terms of his personal relationships. His Honour paid particular regard to the medical evidence placed before him in relation to the applicant’s health, accepting that the 65 year old offender did have a medical condition but nonetheless coming to a view, clearly open to him, that the correctional health service was able to maintain and treat that condition. His Honour appropriately distinguished the case on which counsel for the applicant relied, namely Regina v Cole (NSWCCA, unreported, 29 March 1994), where the clear evidence of depressive suicidal tendencies in the applicant was taken into account in circumstances where that applicant had pleaded guilty. The learned sentencing Judge here was conscious of the circumstances in which this applicant would be serving his sentence, namely to a great extent under protection.  
      
       
     115 As the Crown has submitted, the appellant engaged in sexual offences against his daughter over a number of years. The penalty for the anal sex in my view was not manifestly excessive given the maximum available and the fact that the appellant had by that time committed sexual offences against his daughter on a number of previous occasions. His Honour rightly found the objective gravity of the offences was extremely serious, the appellant being in a position of trust. His daughter was young when the offences commenced and was under his control. 
      
       
     116 It is to be noted also that his Honour found special circumstances, reduced the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence in relation to the buggery offence and gave the benefit to the applicant of all sentences commencing from the same date. It would have been open to his Honour to give consideration to questions of cumulation and totality in accordance with the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624.  
      
       
     117 The applicant has failed to persuade me that there was any error on the part of the learned sentencing Judge in approach, principle and thus outcome. Whilst I would be prepared to grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     118 Thus I propose these orders: 
      
       
        
       (a) Appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
        
        
       (b) Leave to appeal against sentence is granted. 
        
        
       (c) Appeal against sentence is dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 STEIN JA:  
      
       
       Introduction 
        
       
     2 I have had the benefit of reading the draft judgment of Carruthers AJ. Because his Honour sets forth the material facts, I am able to state my conclusions without undue elaboration. 
      
       
     3 I am unable to share his Honour’s opinion that the Crown appeal should be upheld and that a sentence of life imprisonment should be imposed on the respondent in lieu of the determinate sentence imposed by Hidden J.  
      
       
     4 The question for the court is whether the level of the respondent’s culpability ‘in the commission of the offence’ is so extreme that the community interest in ‘retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence’ can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence (s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). 
      
       
     5 From the observations of Wood CJ at CL in R v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409 at [87] it seems that the common law concept of the ‘worst case category’ is really little different from that postulated by s 61(1). 
      
       
     6 This requires features of ‘very great heinousness’ and the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime, R v Twala (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 November 1994). 
      
       
     7 While I agree with Carruthers AJ that there is no disharmony between the ‘worst case’ concept and s 61(1), the latter does include reference to ‘community protection’ which can only to be met through the imposition of a life sentence. This may impose an extra gloss on the Twala test. 
      
       
        
       Sentencing errors alleged by Crown 
        
        
       (a) The significance of the escape 
        
       
     8 The Crown submitted that his Honour made a number of errors in the sentencing of the respondent. First, that he failed to adequately take into account the significance of the respondent escaping from custody and then committing the murder of Ms Michael. There is no doubt that this was a substantial aggravating factor in the offence. 
      
       
     9 However, it is clear that Hidden J did take account of the respondent’s escape, and of his commission of the murder while he was at large, see in particular paras [27] and [32] of his reasons on sentence. 
      
       
     10 His Honour also had to sentence the respondent for the separate offence of escaping from lawful custody. He noted that that offence was of itself serious. Further, it was an abuse of the respondent’s privileged classification for an offender who was serving a lengthy term of imprisonment for a very serious crime. For the escape his Honour imposed a cumulative sentence of 2 years imprisonment to commence upon the expiry of the remaining minimum term that he was subject to, and further ordered that the two years be served prior to the commencement of the determinate sentence for the subject murder of Ms Michael. 
      
       
     11 I do not accept that his Honour attached inadequate significance to the aggravating circumstance of the respondent’s escape and commission of the murder whilst at large. One thing is plain and conceded by the Crown, that the escape was not for the purpose of committing murder. Rather, it was for the purpose of being with Ms Michael and hopefully starting a new life interstate together. 
      
       
     12 Hidden J accepted that the escape was a feature of substantial aggravation in the offence and I do not see that he erred in the manner contended for by the Crown. 
      
       
        
         
         (b) Prisoner’s awareness of his capacity to kill  
         
        
       
     13 The second error submitted by the Crown was his Honour’s alleged failure to take into account, as a matter of aggravation, the respondent’s awareness of his capacity to kill. In this respect it was submitted that his Honour made an error in fact finding. In particular, it was contended that his Honour erred in his assessment of a particular passage in a letter from the respondent to Ms Michael, which the respondent commenced to write on 19 January 1999. 
      
       
     14 The particular passage of the letter is set out in Hidden J’s judgment and is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         I know you have a lot of confusion, but for fuck sake would you just turn to me, tell me everything and trust me. I do things babe, I am not a talker. Just ask Donna when I told her to stop playing games with my heart or I would put a hole in her heart. If I say I’ll do something, then believe I’ll do it.  
         
        
       
     15 The reference to ‘Donna’ was to the respondent’s first murder victim, Ms Newland. It seems that Ms Michael had been made aware by the respondent of the crime for which he was serving his sentence. 
      
       
     16 It was this passage in particular that his Honour had in mind when he said: 
      
       
        
         
         Disturbing as to those passages in the letters are, I incline to the view that they were rhetorical. In any event, I doubt that the offender had sufficient self awareness at that time to have the insight for which the Crown contended.  
         
        
       
     17 As Carruthers AJ says, the word ‘rhetorical’ has a number of meanings and like his Honour I am also uncertain as to how Hidden J was using it. I tend to accept that his Honour used the word in the sense of using words in an artificial or extravagant manner so as to make a point, as opposed to a calm or sober statement. 
      
       
     18 Because of the centrality of this passage to the Crown’s submission, and Carruthers AJ’s acceptance of the submission, it is important to examine the letter more closely. In addition, the court should not lose sight of the evidence given by the respondent and his cross-examination on the contents of some of his letters. 
      
       
     19 The letter dated Tuesday, 19 January 1999 is a very long one – 17 foolscap pages. The respondent started to write it on the date it bears but continued writing from time to time over several days. The passage in question was written on Thursday, 21 January 1999 and is part of 6 pages. Either later that same day, or the next, the respondent wrote two further pages. These were apologetic, conciliatory and loving in tone. In part the letter says: 
      
       
        
         
         Im sorry baby for carrying on in the early pages of this letter, actually it was only the page before this one. 
         
        
       
     20 One of the reasons why I believe that too great an emphasis should not be placed on the particular passage in the letter (which I have set out above in para 14) is that it was written 6 months before the respondent’s escape. In the ensuing months there was no repetition of the ‘threat’ in similar words, notwithstanding the apparent deterioration of the relationship and the respondent’s suspicions with regard to Ms Michael’s association with other men. 
      
       
     21 The respondent escaped on 27 July 1999. The letter closest in time to his escape is a letter dated 9 June 1999, viz 7 weeks beforehand. Although it should be mentioned that there are several undated letters which may have been written in June 1999. 
      
       
     22 In the letter of 9 June the respondent is obviously concerned that his relationship with Ms Michael may be over. The letter includes an acceptance that Ms Michael might be with someone else, but expresses the hope that they will still see each other one day. 
      
       
     23 Notwithstanding the respondent’s fears regarding the relationship, there is not one word of anger or reproach at Ms Michael in this letter for her failing to visit or write, nor about her likely taking up with another man. Certainly nothing which can be interpreted as a threat.  
      
       
     24 Important as it is, I would hesitate to place too much significance upon the passage in the lengthy letter dated 19 January 1999, amongst many letters written by the respondent, particularly since it was sent 6 ½ months before the murder. 
      
       
     25 The respondent gave evidence at his sentencing on 7 December 2001. From the transcript it appears that his testimony took up the morning, more or less equally divided between examination in chief and cross-examination. His Honour, an experienced judge, had the opportunity to make an assessment of the respondent and of his evidence. The respondent said that he and Ms Michael had earlier discussed his plan to escape in July. He also said that when he saw Ms Michael at her home, she was very happy to see him. He stayed the night and the next day, before he left for Brisbane to investigate the possibility of moving there. The respondent then explained what occurred when he returned to Ms Michael’s home in the early hours of 1 August 1999 and saw the man on the bed. The respondent said that he had become consumed by uncontrollable anger. He was overwhelmed by anger and rage. 
      
       
     26 During a thorough cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Maxwell QC, the respondent denied that he killed both Donna Newland and Ms Michael because he believed that if he could not have them, no one could. 
      
       
     27 The respondent said that at times he suspected that Ms Michael was with another man but that she had denied it. The difficulties in their relationship had been discussed and resolved, and, as at the time of his escape the respondent believed the relationship was still on foot. 
      
       
     28 The respondent was closely cross-examined about two of the letters that he had written to Ms Michael from gaol, particularly the letter dated 19 January 1999 and the portion submitted by the Crown to constitute the ‘threat’. The respondent denied that he was threatening Ms Michael and attempted to explain the passage away partly by being under the influence of sleeping pills. The respondent said that the analogy with Donna Newland was ‘an indefensible one’ and ‘disgusting’. He maintained that the passage meant no more than that he kept his promises.  
      
       
     29 It is important to record that the respondent was not cross-examined about any of the numerous other letters which he wrote to Ms Michael from gaol. His Honour considered the two letters the subject of the cross-examination of the respondent, see paras [18] to [21] and [25]. Apart from a brief reference to other letters in para [19], his Honour did not specifically deal with any of them. This is understandable since it is apparent that they were not the subject of any Crown submissions, except in a general way. 
      
       
     30 With regard to the cross-examination of the respondent his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         The offender’s evidence was the subject of searching cross-examination and, while he clearly had a motive to put his actions in the best possible light, he did not impress me unfavourably as a witness. His account appears to be broadly consistent with what he told police on the day of his arrest. He acknowledged that, at the time he escaped, he feared that Ms Michael might have formed another relationship. However, I would not conclude that that was his reason for escaping. I accept that he and Ms Michael discussed his plan to escape, and that he did so out of concern for her welfare and in the hope that he and she could start a new life in another state. Equally, I accept his account of his interaction with Ms Michael in the days following his escape. Certainly, I would not prefer the hearsay material in her sister-in-law’s statement to his sworn evidence about the matter.  
         
        
       
     31 This court does not have the advantage of the sentencing judge. It is apparent that his Honour used that advantage and that his factual conclusions regarding the respondent’s evidence were ones which were open to him. I am certainly not persuaded that this court should interfere with his Honour’s factual findings, particularly where the basis is a question of weight. 
      
       
     32 It follows that I do not conclude that his Honour was in error in the manner in which he dealt with the ‘critical passage’ in the letter dated 19 January 1999 and the respondent’s awareness of his capacity to kill. I am certainly not inclined to place the same importance on that passage as does Carruthers AJ, given the context of the correspondence, the time gap from January to the end of July 1999, his Honour’s concession of the respondent’s evidence and the Crown’s acceptance that the killing was not premeditated. I do not see how it may be concluded that the dreadful events which transpired on 1 August 1999 demonstrated that the respondent meant what he said in the passage of the 19 January 1999 letter. What must be kept in the forefront of one’s mind is that the Crown accepted that the murder of Ms Michael was unpremeditated. If it had contended otherwise, one would expect a more vigorous and comprehensive cross-examination of the respondent with emphasis on the content of letters other than the two which were squarely put to the respondent. 
      
       
        
         
         (c) Role of respondent’s personality 
         
        
       
     33 The next error of his Honour maintained by the Crown is his failure to adequately reflect the extent to which the respondent’s dominating and possessive personality played in the murder. However, his Honour did find that the respondent’s violent reaction was the product of his dominating and possessive personality [para 26]. Nonetheless, his Honour rejected the Crown’s argument that the murder of Ms Michael, as with Ms Newland, was purely the result of the respondent’s inability to accept rejection. That is, that he killed Ms Michael because he decided that if he could not have her, no one could. 
      
       
     34 In my opinion, his Honour was entitled to conclude that the respondent’s emotional response was, as he put it, ‘more complex’. While accepting that the respondent‘s violence was indeed a product of his domineering and possessive personality, his Honour also found that the respondent was moved by a sense of betrayal and that he had squandered everything he had gained during his imprisonment. 
      
       
     35 Again, it seems to me that this additional finding was open to his Honour to make on the material which was before him, his assessment of it and of the offender. I do not accept that his Honour saw this factor as a mitigating one, rather he was entitled to take the ‘betrayal’ into account as a factor contributing to the offence. 
      
       
     36 I am unpersuaded that his Honour erred in the manner submitted by the Crown. Hidden J did not make an erroneous distinction between the two murders in 1990 and 1999. 
      
       
        
         
         (d) Community protection and dangerousness 
         
        
       
     37 Fourthly, the Crown argued that his Honour failed to adequately take into account the aspect of community protection. This is because his Honour, so it was contended, wrongly concluded that with maturation over the lengthy sentence the respondent must serve, and continuing counselling, his Honour had ‘some hope that he will not re-offend upon his release’. Involved in this submission is the Crown’s assertion of the respondent’s dangerousness and the content of the medical evidence before the court.38 Also involved in this submission is the Crown’s argument that his Honour erred in accepting the respondent’s evidence of his belief at the time he escaped that the relationship was still on foot and that he and Ms Michael had discussed moving interstate and starting a new life. Reliance is placed upon the contents of the respondent’s letter to Ms Michael of 9 June 1999, said to be the last letter that the respondent wrote to her before his escape. 
      
       
     39 However, in accepting the respondent’s evidence, his Honour noted that it received some support from other sources, see para [22]. In particular, that Ms Michael was aware of the respondent’s intention to escape once he became reclassified in July. Also, the respondent’s account of his interaction with Ms Michael in the days following his escape. For the same reasons as I have given earlier, I do not believe that this court should intervene and reject his Honour’s factual findings, which were findings I see as open to him to make on the evidence. 
      
       
     40 The evidence about the respondent’s future dangerousness needs to be considered because it goes directly to the element in s 61(1) concerned with community protection. This is putting aside for the moment the question of whether the offence qualifies within the section as to its extreme level of culpability. This is an issue to which I will return later in these reasons. 
      
       
     41 The Crown case on the issue of dangerousness relies on a number of factors. The principal ones are the ‘chilling similarity’ between the two murders; the respondent’s absence of any psychiatric condition and Dr Neilson’s evidence that there was no guarantee that counselling will reduce the respondent’s risk of further offending. 
      
       
     42 While there are clearly ‘chilling similarities’ in the two murders committed by the respondent 9 years apart, there are, as his Honour found, substantial differences. Foremost among the differences is the absence of premeditation in the murder of Ms Michael, accepted by the Crown, as compared to the murder in 1990 of Ms Newland, which was premeditated over an extended period.  
      
       
     43 Another major difference is with regard to the murder weapon. In the murder of Ms Newland the respondent prepared himself with a knife, whereas with Ms Michael he did not.  
      
       
     44 These differences were significant notwithstanding the strong similarities in the two murders, ie killing one’s girlfriend with a knife. Thus, although the similarities assumed significance for the respondent’s sentencing, the significance was diminished by the differences, particularly the absence of premeditation for the second killing. 
      
       
     45 In my opinion, the central question on the issue of community protection is whether the evidence was such as to lead the court to the conclusion that the only way that the community can be protected from the respondent is by the imposition of a life sentence. Again, this is setting aside the issue of the respondent’s level of culpability required by s 61(1), to which I will come. 
      
       
     46 The effect of the determinate sentences imposed by his Honour is that the respondent will not commence his sentence for the murder of Ms Michael until 25 April 2005. That sentence will expire on 24 April 2030. The respondent is not eligible to be considered for parole until 25 April 2024. 
      
       
     47 The respondent was 18 years old when he was imprisoned for the murder of Ms Newland. Apart from 5 days when he was at large, he will have spent 40 years in gaol by the time he completes his current sentences. By then he will be 58 years of age. By the time he is eligible to be considered for parole, he will have spent 34 years in prison and will be 52 years of age. 
      
       
     48 Thus there is plenty of time for the maturation which Dr Neilson referred to in his evidence, as well as continuous counselling. True it is that Dr Neilson could give no guarantees, but that is hardly surprising. Hidden J also summarised the report of Professor Susan Hayes, an eminent clinical psychologist, whom his Honour said was more optimistic than Dr Neilson. Psychometric testing was undertaken and Professor Hayes reported that: 
      
       
        
         
         The personality test indicates that Mr Miles would be a good candidate for treatment and he himself says that he has benefited greatly from 18 months’ counselling with a prison psychologist. 
         
        
       
     49 It strikes me that some credit must be given to the Parole Board and to the parole system. I cannot accept that a Parole Board, acting reasonably, would grant the respondent parole unless it was satisfied, on appropriate expert evidence, that the respondent did not pose a threat to the community, viz that the community would be adequately protected. 
      
       
     50 In my view, Hidden J was entitled to conclude as he did on the prospects of the respondent’s rehabilitation. Crucial as it is, the need for protection of the community can be adequately met by the sentence imposed by his Honour. It is a falsity to conclude that community protection can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence. 
      
       
        
       The extent of culpability 
        
       
     51 I turn to the issue of defining the extent of the respondent’s culpability. Is it so extreme as to require a life sentence to be imposed? I am not persuaded by the Crown’s submission that condign punishment is demanded. 
      
       
     52 Before proceeding further I should say that I agree with what Carruthers AJ has written concerning the Crown submission that if the criteria in s 61(1) are satisfied, the subjective circumstances have no relevance. The submission should be rejected, see Harris at 425. Of course, there is no doubt that there will be cases where the objective gravity will overwhelm any subjective circumstances, but a two-stage process, as Carruthers AJ makes plain, is required. The first question is whether the level of culpability is so extreme as to warrant the imposition of a life term? Secondly, whether the subjective features are capable of displacing the need to impose the maximum term? 
      
       
     53 I do not accept that this murder, appalling as it was, and in the context of the second killing within a decade in chillingly similar circumstances, qualifies within s 61(1). I am unable to see that it is so extreme in its heinousness as to demand a life sentence as the only way to meet the community interest in retribution, punishment, deterrence and community protection. 
      
       
     54 The facts, inordinately disturbing as they are, do not to my mind qualify within the category of the worst class of case. I say this primarily, but not entirely, because of the lack of premeditation in the killing of Ms Michael. 
      
       
     55 The killing by the respondent is doubtless an offence of great heinousness but it cannot be concluded that there are absent any facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime. 
      
       
     56 The court was referred to 21 cases of natural life sentences imposed for murder in NSW since 1990. I agree with Carruthers AJ that limited assistance can be derived from a comparison. Nonetheless, as with his Honour, I think that they do provide some limited help. When one examines the cases, what is apparent is that, for the very most part, the offences exceed the level of culpability of the present case. My concern if this case is to be regarded as within the criteria in s 61(1), is that the imposition of a life sentence will be devalued. Such a decision will impermissibly stretch the category of the worst class of case. I accept that there will always be borderline cases, and this may be thought to be one such example, but I am unable to conclude that the level of the respondent’s culpability is so extreme as to demand a life term as the only way of meeting the community interest in punishment, deterrence and protection. 
      
       
     57 But even if the offence was to qualify within s 61(1), it is my opinion that the subjective circumstances displace the need for the maximum penalty. The particular features are the relative youth of the respondent (he was 28 years of age at the time of sentence by Hidden J); the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation as found by his Honour and the plea of guilty entered by the respondent. 
      
       
     58 Finally, if contrary to my conclusions, the respondent qualifies for a life sentence under s 61(1), this court should not intervene and substitute such a sentence because of the principle of double jeopardy and the discretion reposing in the court on Crown appeals, see R v Allpass (1994) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562 - 563. 
      
       
     59 The principle of double jeopardy is particularly important to consider where a determinate sentence with parole is sought to be replaced by a life sentence without parole. In this regard, I agree with the remarks of Wood CJ at CL in Harris at [131] to [134]. 
      
       
     60 In my opinion, the sentence imposed by Hidden J is not a manifestly inadequate one and the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     61 BERGIN J: I have had the benefit of reading the draft judgments of Stein JA and Carruthers AJ. I agree with the orders proposed by Carruthers AJ and with the reasons given by his Honour. In addition to those reasons I add the following in respect of the respondent’s extreme culpability in the commission of the offence for which, in my view, the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met by the imposition of a life sentence.  
      
       
     62 The respondent explained the circumstances of the killing of Ms Michael in a conversation with Detective Senior Constable Peddle on 2 August 1999 in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         I wasn’t supposed to come home for a week but just caught the bus back. I was tired and when I got to her house I knocked on the door for about 20 minutes and she wouldn’t answer so I forced the glass doors and they smashed. I think everyone freaked out. I did too and she was just inside with another bloke and I just lost it. 
         
        
        
         
         The only trouble I have been (sic) was because of sheilas lying to me. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     63 The explanation that the respondent gave for the killing of Ms Newland nine years earlier was provided to the investigating police in a record of interview as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         She was talking about her boyfriend and I was becoming very jealous and angry. I told Donna to use the toilets and inside the toilets I kept telling her how much I loved her then she just kept talking about her boyfriend. My anger was so strong I pulled a knife from the back of my jeans and used it on her. 
         
        
       
     64 After a period of apparent emotional closeness to the respondent, both Ms Newland and Ms Michael had decided to distance themselves from him. The respondent reacted identically to each of them. He wrote a barrage of letters and made numerous phone calls to each of them. In each case he claimed he spent an affectionate time with Ms Newland and Ms Michael, just prior to the murder. In each case he used a knife to kill them. In each case he claimed that jealousy and anger led to the killing.  
      
       
     65 Hidden J expressed the view that the differences between the two murders were significant. His Honour said that the Crown Prosecutor acknowledged that: “this killing was not premeditated” (par 25). It is important to note precisely what the learned Crown Prosecutor said in this regard. At page 60 of the transcript before Hidden J on 7/12/01 the following exchange occurred: 
      
       
        
         
         His Honour: Just so I can be clear on this. Justice Mathews found that the first killing was premeditated. I take it you don’t submit that about this one. 
         
        
        
         
         Maxwell: Well, no your Honour. What I do submit is that it can’t be viewed as a plan to escape in order to kill Nadine, but it can be viewed as a plan to escape with the possibility that if she is doing something behind his back, if she is, in his view, two timing him, the possibility is that he will exercise the capacity that he knows he has and he has stated in the letter, that he put a hole in Donna’s heart and that’s exactly what he did to Nadine.  
         
        
       
     66 The Crown maintained that the respondent had an awareness of his propensity for violence and must have foreseen the possibility of inflicting violence upon Ms Michael. In the second murder, the subject of these proceedings, it is true that the number of wounds inflicted upon the deceased were greater than the single wound inflicted in the first murder. It is also true that in the first murder the respondent was a young man of apparently good character. At the time of the second murder the respondent was an escaped convicted murderer. The second murder was committed in the presence of the deceased’s young children. It also involved the assault of one of them as an attempt was made by that child to intervene. The child was kicked out of the way by the respondent. In my view, any differences between the two murders do not assist the respondent in these proceedings.  
      
       
     67 Hidden J referred to the “disturbing” letters the respondent wrote to Ms Michael and said: “in any event, I doubt that the offender had sufficient self-awareness at that time to have the insight for which the Crown contended”. The contention to which Hidden J was referring was that the respondent “must have been aware of his propensity to react violently to rejection and must have foreseen the possibility of his inflicting violence upon Ms Michael if his worst fears were realised” (par 25). 
      
       
     68 His Honour did not give any reasons for his doubt that the respondent lacked sufficient self-awareness of his propensity to react violently or to foresee the possibility of inflicting violence upon Ms Michael. The letters in evidence before Hidden J were those written by the respondent between October 1998 and mid 1999. The respondent claimed that he had destroyed Ms Michaels’ letters. From the letters it is apparent that Ms Michael and the respondent grew emotionally close between October 1998 and January 1999. It is also apparent that the respondent reacted extremely angrily towards a correctional officer during one of Ms Michael’s visits to him in December 1998. It was not long after this event that Ms Michael commenced attempts to distance herself from the respondent.  
      
       
     69 From the contents of the letters it appears from about February 1999 that Ms Michael gave the respondent a series of excuses for her failure to visit him. She informed him that she was a prostitute and that he would not therefore have any desire to continue the relationship. She also informed him that she had a serious illness. Neither of these explanations deflected the respondent’s letter writing or telephone calls. At one stage Ms Michael had the telephone cut-off and the respondent wrote complaining bitterly that this had happened. Ms Michael also informed the respondent that she had commenced a relationship with another man.  
      
       
     70 The letters that the respondent wrote to Ms Michael were lengthy and repetitive. In quoting from them I have extracted the portions relevant to the matters upon which I am making comment. In doing so I have taken care to ensure that the sense of the statements is accurate and that the statements are not taken unfairly out of context. The respondent wrote on 20 March 1999: 
      
       
        
         
         I find no letters from you at all and no visit. Now I’m stuck with a girl’s name on my chest that doesn’t even care about me let alone love me…I can’t believe you are throwing our love away just because you are a worker, what a poor excuse…But you have made it clear to me Nadine you do not want to be with me anymore… Obviously you have found someone else… 
          
         Just fuckin wake up to yourself babe, do you really want to cause me this much pain. If you’ve got something else I don’t give a fuck about that. If you think some other guy is better than me then think that, but I know he’s not, so at least if you stay my friend, when you get sick of him you can pick up the pieces of this second best man and have me back… 
          
         So what if you have another boyfriend, does that mean you have to be so cold to the man who has shown you so much of his love… 
          
         Please baby stop this selfishness be my friend and for fucks sake just make the effort to come and see me… 
          
         I have begged you to please come and see me you know how much hurt you cause when you don’t bother to show… 
          
         Look at me 3 am in the morning while you are tucked in with your new boyfriend you won’t even give me the time of day …you’ve really enjoyed destroying my life. 
         
        
       
     71 On 5 May 1999 the respondent wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         I’ve been lied to so much Nadine, now you’ve come clean that you were with Angelo, how could you do that to me babe…..and this other skunk Angelo, their days will come, every dog really does have its day, you can count on that. 
         
        
       
     72 On 13 May 1999 the respondent wrote again: 
      
       
        
         
         Well I guess you’re probably just happy with the fact you don’t have to be in my life anymore… 
          
         I’m probably long forgotten by now but my sweetie, and someone has replaced me… 
          
         It’s hard for me to let go Nadine... 
          
         Only 18 months and we could have been together. Me a free man legally and you as my girl. 
         
        
       
     73 It is clear from these letters and the letter of 9 June 1999 set out in full in Carruthers AJ’s judgment, that prior to his escape the respondent believed that Ms Michael had commenced a relationship with another man. 
      
       
     74 There are also references throughout the respondent’s letters in which he compares his then present predicament of rejection by Ms Michael to his rejection by Ms Newland. On 21/22 December 1998 he wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         I will be interested to hear your response as this feeling of badness is quite strong. The horrible thing is I’ve only had this feeling once before and it turned out to be true, my worst nightmare. Just like what you’d see on a video. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       
     75 By 7 February 1999 the respondent had formed the view that he should perceive his relationship with Ms Michael to be that of husband and wife. On that date he wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         You were in the wrong for not showing up and I was in the wrong for carrying on the way I did. Let’s both be sorry. I truly am. I was just so devastated, every girl I’ve ever known has lied to me but you’re my wife and you’re not allowed to lie to me. 
         
        
       
     76 On 8 March 1999 the respondent wrote: 
      
       
        
        
         
         But I haven’t had a letter for so long from you, cause you have probably just about had enough of me. This is why I must explain some things to you babe, to hope that I can re-gain your full love, which I treasure. 
          
         Babe it’s happened to me before. I lost Donna because of my own stupidity. She loved me more than anything just like you but after two years of being with me she couldn’t take my demanding ways and being that young babe I didn’t see that it was my fault. I don’t want it to happen again with you Nadine, I love you dearly, so I want you to know that I am aware of this problem I have with my personality. 
          
         As far as everything else goes but babe, you will be happy. I would never hurt you with betrayal, I am 100% loyal, I would protect you with my life and I would love you till I die but you would probably just have to help me improve on this particular problem. I don’t mean it babe, this is only the 2nd time I’ve given my heart to a girl and I don’t want to fail again, otherwise I’ll be going from girl to girl for the rest of my life and I don’t want this. 
         
        
       
     77 On 13 March 1999 the respondent wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         I know I’m not very good at relationships Nadine, so I’m having regular fortnightly sessions with the psychologist, in direct regards to our relationship and how I must be in order to treat you like the angel you are. 
         
        
        
         
         You see Nadine I haven’t had a proper relationship in 9 years…and I tried too hard and didn’t know how to act. I have only associated with males for the past decade and the way you get respect from them is so simple, it’s just a matter of putting fear into them. They have brainwashed me baby, I used to be such a holy man and I will be again with your guidance and God’s help. 
         
        
       
     78 It is apparent that Ms Michael wrote some letters to the respondent in March 1999 but did not write again until May 1999. On 13 May 1999 the respondent wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         But again my dreams of love have vanished right before my eyes. 
         
        
       
     79 In an undated letter, from its context probably written in May/June 1999, the respondent wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         If you…leave me…I’m staying alone for the rest of my life I will never trust another girl. It happened to me once, I get a girl, we are getting married and shit a guy with half my looks and style but a heap of money comes and steals her away from me. Anyway you know the story but I was 18 then and didn’t really know how to handle them situations. Today I would simply go over take his money flog him senseless and take my girl back. But I can’t fucking take it again, I really thought you would be my wife, you already said yes fuck ya. You can’t go Indian giving on marriage, well I hope you won’t baby, this is my last shot to get Nadine back in my arms where she bloody well belongs. 
         
        
        
       
     80 In another undated letter, from its context probably also written in mid 1999, the respondent wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         Stop comparing me to the pathetic excuses of men you’ve had in the past. I am Danny Miles. You understand me I would crush your ex-boyfriends like cockroaches….yes I can be an extremely violent man babe and I am dangerous but one thing I know I would never hurt you but I need your fucking respect. I have so much respect in here and that’s no lie, anyone who has got something bad to say about me is a coward cause they know if they say it my face it’s a war they won’t win. I’m one prick of a guy to have as an enemy. That’s not directed at you in any way I hope you know baby, I could never hurt you even though you fucked my head up and I’ve knocked two guys out in the last two weeks. My anger is not against you its against our situation. 
         
        
       
     81 These letters demonstrate the respondent’s awareness of his capacity for violence and that he knew he could be “dangerous”. The continued comparison of the relationship with that of the relationship with Ms Newland and the claimed attendance upon the psychologist, whether true or not, demonstrates an awareness of his propensity to react violently to rejection and the possibility of inflicting violence upon Ms Michael. He stated clearly in his letter of 8 March 1999 that he had a problem with his personality. All of these matters lead to the irresistible conclusion that was contended for by the Crown. 
      
       
     82 The “disturbing” passage in the January 1999 letter to which Hidden J referred in which the respondent referred to putting a “hole” in Ms Newland’s heart is in my view inappropriately referred to as “rhetoric” when all of the letters are taken into account. This respondent, in no uncertain terms, informed Ms Michael that he was an extremely violent and dangerous man. On one view, notwithstanding the respondent’s protestations to the contrary, the statement: “but one thing I know I would never hurt you but I need your fucking respect” conveys the position that if Ms Michael did not pay to the respondent the respect to which he thought he was entitled, then he may hurt her. That is exactly what happened. 83 Although Stein JA has said that he finds it understandable that Hidden J did not specifically deal with any of these letters because it was apparent that the Crown had not referred to them except in a general way, I must disagree. The Crown had clearly called into question the version of events given by the respondent in his evidence before Hidden J. Mr Maxwell QC said at tr. 58: 
      
       
        
         
         So, in effect, the proposition he puts is that it was really agreed between them that there wouldn’t be contact or much contact. That really is at complete odds with the letters that he is writing. For instance, the letter of 9 June 1999…The Crown submits it is very obvious, not through just that letter, but a number of references to the letters that were extracted in the schedule, that he is most concerned about her not visiting, about her not ringing, about him having no contact and it smacks much more of the reason for escape-he denies it-but being about him wanting to determine what is happening, what Nadine is doing in her life and the Crown doesn’t and can’t put it as high as him intending to break out to kill her because she is with another man, but certainly there’s evidence in the letters of his great concern that she is with another man… 
         
        
       
     84 It is apparent from this extract of the Crown’s submissions before Hidden J that the Crown had provided a schedule of extracts from the letters and specifically referred to them. Hidden J referred only to the two letters extracted or referred to in Carruthers AJ’s judgment but as to the balance said only: “I have copies of a large number of letters from the offender to Ms Michael, and in some of them his displeasure about difficulties in their relationship was expressed in no uncertain terms” (par 19). There was no analysis of the letters in relation to whether the respondent had any self-awareness. I am of the view that his Honour erred in concluding that the respondent lacked self-awareness of his propensity as contended for by the Crown. This finding was against the evidence and the weight of the evidence before his Honour. Additionally the fact that the respondent was “moved by his sense of betrayal” as Hidden J accepted (par 26) could hardly be seen as a mitigating factor either in the seriousness of this crime or in the sentence to be imposed upon the respondent. 
      
       
     85 The respondent is a violent and extremely dangerous person. Even imprisonment did not prevent the second senseless murder of another defenceless woman. His antecedent criminal history, the murder of Ms Newland, does illuminate his culpability in the murder of Ms Michael. He was given an extremely good chance to rehabilitate himself after the first murder. In my view it is misconceived to view his sense of betrayal as some lessening of his culpability. It seems to me that such an explanation demonstrates how very dangerous he is. He has killed two people when they, to use his words, did not give him the “respect” he thought he needed. In other words if he feels betrayed, as he did in both cases, he murders the betrayer. Just prior to his escape the education officers within the prison system thought the respondent was “dependable”. Within weeks he had escaped and killed for a second time in circumstances so chillingly similar to the first murder. 
      
       
     86 The respondent’s culpability in the present offence was indeed extreme. Whilst an escaped convicted murderer, the murder of a woman by bashing her and stabbing her numerous times after kicking a child who was desperately trying to intervene and in the presence of that child, in my view, fits easily into the description “atrocious, detestable, hateful, gravely reprehensible and extremely wicked”: the dictionary meanings of the term ‘heinous’ referred to in R v Arthurell, (Hunt CJ at CL, 3 October 1997 unreported), as referred to in R v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409 at 423. I am satisfied that this murder falls within the “worst category case”.  
      
       
     87 It is this Court’s responsibility to fix a sentence commensurate with the respondent’s culpability. In this case I am of the view that the respondent’s culpability is so extreme that he should not have the benefit of the parole system to which Stein JA refers in his draft judgment. He has already had that opportunity and has proved beyond any doubt that he should not be a candidate for such a system. I am of the view that the only way that the community interest in the relevant matters referred to in s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 can be met in this case is a sentence of imprisonment for life. 
      
       
     88 CARRUTHERS AJ: This is an appeal pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by the Director of Public Prosecutions against the sentence imposed for murder on the respondent by his Honour Justice Hidden in the Supreme Court, Sydney, on 26 February 2002. 
      
       
     89 On 2 February 2001 the respondent pleaded guilty to one count of escape lawful custody on 27 July 1999, pursuant to s 310D of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Act) which offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for ten years and on 2 June 2001 to one count of murder on 1 August 1999, pursuant to s 18 and s 19A of the Act.  
      
       
     90 His Honour sentenced the respondent to a fixed term of imprisonment for two years with respect to the escape lawful custody, to be served at the expiration of the minimum term of his sentence for a previous offence of murder. This sentence is to date from 25 April 2003 and to expire on 24 April 2005. 
      
       
     91 With respect to the murder he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of twenty-five years to commence on 25 April 2005 and to expire on 24 April 2030. A non-parole period was fixed for nineteen years to commence on 25 April 2005 and to expire on 24 April 2024. 
      
       
     92 A Notice of Appeal asserting inadequacy of the sentence for murder was signed by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions on 5 March 2002 and served on the respondent on 8 March 2002.  
      
       
     93 The respondent was born on 13 May 1972. He was brought up in the Concord area. He generally had a satisfactory family life albeit he claimed that he was excessively punished by his father for trivial misdemeanours. 
      
       
     94 His performance at school was average and as a child he learned the piano. 
      
       
     95 On 20 October 1990 the respondent stabbed to death a sixteen year old girl named Donna Newland, he himself being only eighteen at the time. He was tried for the murder of Ms Newland in 1982 before Mathews J and, while he did not deny the killing, he raised issues of voluntariness, provocation and diminished responsibility. Those issues were resolved by the jury against the respondent and he was found guilty of murder. Mathews J sentenced him to imprisonment for eighteen years to commence on 20 October 1990 (the date of his arrest) comprising a minimum term of twelve and a half years and an additional term of five and a half years. Her Honour found that special circumstances existed which permitted her to vary the proportion set out in s 5 of the then Sentencing Act. 
      
       
     96 The minimum term set by her Honour was to expire on 19 April 2003. The additional term of five and a half years to commence on 20 April 2003 was to expire on 19 October 2008.  
      
       
     97 Hidden J summarised the circumstances of Ms Newland’s murder as follows. The respondent and Ms Newland had met in Sydney in May 1989 when she was fourteen and he was seventeen. They fell passionately in love and believed that their devotion to each other would last for ever. At the end of that year Ms Newland moved with her parents to the Central Coast of New South Wales, and in January 1990 the respondent moved to Perth. Over the ensuing few months there was correspondence between them which, as Mathews J observed in her remarks on sentence, demonstrated “The continued closeness and intensity of their relationship”.  
      
       
     98 However, over time Ms Newland established a new group of friends on the Central Coast and formed a relationship with another young man. The respondent returned to Sydney from Perth and, it seems, that Ms Newland told him that she wanted to live her own life. She reiterated this when he visited her on the Central Coast and she told him about her new relationship. Thereafter he wrote her what Mathews J described as “a barrage of letters”, from which it was clear that he was obsessed with her and by the idea that theirs was an eternal love, and that he could not accept that the relationship had come to an end. He telephoned her regularly, the calls being affectionate at times, but abusive on other occasions. 
      
       
     99 There was a body of evidence from former friends of the respondent and Ms Newland, which her Honour accepted, that the respondent told them of his intention to kill her. Ms Newland travelled to Sydney to see the respondent on the day before the murder, and they were observed to be very affectionate. Nevertheless, that night he told a friend of his, whose evidence Mathews J accepted, that he no longer loved Ms Newland and that he was going to “pay her back” by stabbing her. 
      
       
     100 At that time the respondent normally carried with him a large knife, and it was with this weapon that he killed Ms Newland the following day. In the light of the evidence and given the manner in which the issues had been left to the jury, her Honour was driven to the conclusion that the killing was premeditated.  
      
       
     101 Mathews J summarised the circumstances of Ms Newland’s murder. She said that it was beyond dispute that the respondent, with a single blow, thrust his knife some eleven and a half centimetres into Ms Newland’s chest, almost severing the third rib and entering the ventricle of the heart. Immediately afterwards he helped her across the park nearby where she collapsed. She was lying on her back with the respondent leaning over her when two young men arrived on the scene. The respondent immediately went to an adjacent house to telephone the police and the ambulance. He returned to Ms Newland and prepared her for resuscitation. However, by the time the ambulance arrived, resuscitative measures proved to be too late and she died shortly thereafter. 
      
       
     102 When asked shortly afterwards why he had committed the murder he said, “Because she was cheating on me”. 
      
       
     103 In a record of interview with police officers the respondent said that when she was talking to him about her boyfriend he became very jealous and angry. He said, “My anger was so strong I pulled the knife from the back of my jeans and used it on her”. Later, he said, “It was a sudden burst of anger and it was totally without thought. It was a reaction that I just did, I just pulled the knife and put it wherever it went. I stabbed her”. 
      
       
     104 Ultimately Mathews J was satisfied that the overwhelming likelihood, on the issues as presented at the trial, that the conviction for murder represented a finding that it was a deliberate and premeditated killing. 
      
       
     105 I turn then to the circumstances leading up to the subject murder. 
      
       
     106 Whilst the respondent was in gaol he developed into an accomplished instrumentalist, singer and songwriter. At the correctional centre where he was housed he was involved with education officers in setting up a recording studio, where he recorded some of his songs. According to Hidden J, testimonials from educational staff prior to his escape spoke most highly of his capacity, dependability and commitment. His Honour found much of this to be apparent from some SBS video footage featuring the respondent and one of his teachers which was in evidence before his Honour.  
      
       
     107 Thus it appeared to his Honour that the respondent had made significant progress towards rehabilitation, with the possibility of a musical career upon his release into the community. Tragically, however, it was, according to his Honour, these very achievements which led to his association with the victim of the murder for which he stood for sentence. The victim of the subject murder, Ms Yolande Adivira Michael, had a mutual friend to whom he provided a recording of some of his music. Ms Michael having heard it, became interested in the respondent and in the latter part of 1998 she wrote to him. After they had corresponded for a time she visited him. She became a regular visitor, as well as communicating with him by phone. Although, according to Hidden J, she was aware of the crime for which he had been imprisoned, a loving relationship developed between the respondent and Ms Michael and they discussed marriage.  
      
       
     108 Ms Michael was the mother of two children from a prior relationship. According to the respondent, she told him of circumstances in her life which he later found to be untrue: for example, that her family had been involved in criminal activity and that they had been cruel to her and forced her to use illicit drugs, and she had been raped. The relationship was not without its difficulties. There was a time when her letters and visits became less frequent and the respondent suspected that there was another man in her life. However, the respondent said that they discussed these difficulties and resolved them and that, at the time of his escape he believed the relationship to be still on foot. 
      
       
     109 Hidden J remarked further that it was the respondent’s account that in March 1999, Ms Michael told him that she had been diagnosed with a life threatening illness and also that she had been forced into prostitution. It is clear that she had been a sex worker, but it may not have been true that she was forced into that occupation or that she suffered such an illness. Nevertheless, the respondent said that he accepted what she told him at face value and it was this information which led him to contemplate escape. He discussed this with Ms Michael, explaining that he would have the opportunity to escape in July 1999, as he expected then to achieve a C2 classification, which would entitle him to work outside the gaol. His Honour accepted that they discussed moving interstate with the two children and starting a new life.  
      
       
     110 The respondent did attain a C2 classification and he escaped from the John Moroney Correctional Centre on 27 July 1999. By reason of his C2 classification the escape was without difficulty. The respondent made his way to the house at Sefton where Ms Michael was living. She was not at home but he got into the house, the respondent said, by climbing through a window. In the early evening Ms Michael arrived at the house with her two children to whom the respondent was introduced. 
      
       
     111 It was the respondent’s evidence, which Hidden J accepted, that Ms Michael was happy to see him and there was no hostility between them. They spent that night and the following day together, and on the following night it was decided, the respondent claimed, that he would travel to Queensland to see if he could arrange accommodation for them there. He intended to make enquiries in that regard through a friend in Brisbane. The respondent said that on 29 July he travelled by coach to Brisbane and saw his friend who believed that she could help him. The respondent returned to Sydney on 31 July, arriving around midnight. By the time he got to Ms Michael’s house it was early morning of 1 August. 
      
       
     112 The respondent said that he knocked on several windows of the house, only to hear Ms Michael demanding that he leave or she would call the police. He thought, however, that she might not have realised that it was he. He looked through a curtain on one of the windows, to see a man next to Ms Michael on a bed. That was a man, Hidden J found, with whom Ms Michael had had an intimate relationship for a “few months, although it appears to have been a casual one”. 
      
       
     113 The respondent said in evidence which the judge accepted, that he had a patchy memory of what then occurred. However, his Honour was satisfied from the evidence that the respondent entered the house by smashing through glass doors leading on to a verandah. He said to Ms Michael: “Why are you running away from me?”. He dragged her towards the kitchen where he obtained a knife. The children emerged from their room, crying and screaming. Ms Michael, the children and the other man fled from the house, but the respondent chased her and stabbed her in the shoulder. He kicked her daughter when she tried to assist her mother. He stabbed Ms Michael several more times, the major injuries being a wound to the neck which perforated the right jugular vein and a deep wound to the chest which penetrated the lung. She died at the scene, the knife still lodged in her chest with the handle snapped off. 
      
       
     114 The respondent ran to a nearby house, where he asked for medical assistance for a gash to his hand and a broken finger. He also asked that the police be called, saying that there had been “an accident”. An occupant of the house called the ambulance and the police, and the respondent waited at the house. He was arrested and was taken under police guard to Bankstown Hospital, where he underwent surgery for the injury to his hand. He was discharged later in the morning and taken to Bankstown Police Station, where he was interviewed.  
      
       
     115 Hidden J referred to evidence given before him by the respondent that when he killed Ms Michael he was consumed by uncontrollable anger. He saw her rejection of him as a betrayal. He believed that by escaping he had turned his back on all that he had achieved during his years in prison, and it seemed to him that he had taken that dire step for nothing.  
      
       
     116 At the sentencing hearing, the learned Crown Prosecutor challenged the respondent’s account of his reason for escaping and what occurred after he arrived at Ms Michael’s home. Reference was made to the fact that Ms Michael had not visited him in prison after April 1999, some months prior to his escape, and he acknowledged that her last letter to him was received in either late May or early June. Thus the Crown contended that, in truth, he escaped because he feared for the future of the relationship and wanted to find out whether she was with another man. This, the Crown argued, demonstrated an abnormal possessiveness similar to that which had led to the killing of Ms Newland years before. 
      
       
     117 Hidden J referred to evidence tending to support that contention. In particular he referred to copies of a large number of letters from the respondent to Ms Michael and commented that in some of them the respondent’s displeasure about difficulties in their relationship was expressed in no uncertain terms. His Honour referred to an undated letter in which the respondent wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         “… you know I’m good enough so why are you continuing to treat (sic) with utter disrespect. Honestly Babe, you’re lucky you’re not a bloke or I would have broke your jaw. In fact I’ve broke blokes’ jaws for less than that …” 
         
        
       
     118 In a letter of January 1999 the respondent wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         “I know you have a lot of confusion, but for fucks’ sake, would you just turn to me, tell me everything and trust me. I do things Babe, I’m not a talker. Just ask Donna when I told her to stop playing games with my heart or I would put a hole in her heart. If I say I’ll do something, then believe I’ll do it.” 
         
        
       
     119 Hidden J referred to the fact that when the respondent was confronted by these passages in cross-examination, he said that he was affected by sleeping pills when he wrote them and that on neither occasion was he suggesting that he would in fact inflict violence upon Ms Michael. 
      
       
     120 The passage from the letter of January 1999 was of course a reference to his killing of Ms Newland. In evidence, he described it as “an indefensible analogy, and … a disgusting one at that”. 
      
       
     121 The respondent said that it was written out of frustration and meant no more than that when he made a promise he always kept it. He believed that people had treated Ms Michael badly in the past and he was intending to assure her that he would not let her down. 
      
       
     122 Hidden J referred to the fact that the respondent’s evidence was the subject of searching cross-examination, and while he clearly had a motive to put his actions in the best possible light, he did not impress his Honour unfavourably as a witness. His Honour said that his account appeared to be broadly consistent with what he told police on the day of his arrest. He acknowledged that, at the time he escaped, he feared that Ms Michael might have formed another relationship. However, his Honour would not conclude that that was his reason for escaping. His Honour accepted that the respondent and Ms Michael discussed his plan to escape, and that he did so out of concern for her welfare and in the hope that he and she could start a new life in another state. Equally, his Honour accepted his account of his interaction with Ms Michael in the days following his escape.  
      
       
     123 Before Hidden J, the Crown did not suggest that the respondent had escaped with the intention of killing Ms Michael if he found her with another man. On the other hand, the Crown argued that the respondent must have been aware of his propensity to react violently to rejection and must have foreseen the possibility of his inflicting violence upon Ms Michael if his worst fears were realised.  
      
       
     124 Hidden J said that he could see force in that argument, particularly in the light of the passages from the letters to which his Honour referred but would hesitate to make that finding. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Disturbing as those passages and the letters are, I incline to the view that they were rhetorical. In any event, I doubt that the offender had sufficient self awareness at that time to have the insight for which the Crown contended.” 
         
        
       
     125 In response to a submission by the Crown that the subject murder, like that of the murdered Ms Newland, was purely the result of the respondent’s inability to accept rejection: in effect, that the respondent killed Ms Michael because he had decided that, if he could not have her, no-one else would, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “However, I considered that his emotional response at the time was more complex than that. No doubt his violent reaction was the product of his dominating and possessive personality, but I accept that he was also moved by his sense of betrayal and his belief that he had squandered everything which he had gained during his imprisonment.” 
         
        
       
     126 His Honour rejected a submission by the Crown that the murder of Ms Michael required the imposition of a life sentence. Reliance was placed by the Crown upon the judgment of this Court in R v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409, which carefully considered s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the common law principles governing the imposition of a maximum sentence. (On 5 March 2002, the High Court refused leave to Mr Harris to appeal from this judgment.) 
      
       
     127 In considering this submission by the Crown Hidden J referred to the reports before him of Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, dated 4 June 2001 and that of Associate Professor Susan Hayes, clinical psychologist, dated 14 June 2001. 
      
       
     128 His Honour noted that Dr Nielssen did not diagnose any psychiatric illness and concluded that the respondent did not meet the diagnostic criteria for any recognised personality disorder although he added that he could be described “as having borderline, narcissistic and paranoid personality traits”. In particular Dr Nielssen considered that both murders arose from the respondent’s inability to cope with rejection and to control his emotional reactions. He saw intensive counselling as the only appropriate method of treatment, but was guarded about the value of counselling as a means of modifying behaviour of that kind. In addition, he said that it is difficult to maintain a long term counselling relationship within the prison system. The best hope he saw for the respondent was normal maturation. 
      
       
     129 His Honour referred to the fact that Associate Professor Hayes noted that the respondent expressed remorse and showed a measure of insight into the effect of the killing on the family of Ms Michael, as well as upon his own family and himself. She thought it possible that his inability to control his anger and disappointment was partly the result of the fact that he had not received appropriate treatment whilst in prison prior to his escape. She concluded that he  
      
       
        
         
         “needs to deal with both offences in counselling, and learn anger management and inter/relationship skills … It is only after lengthy future counselling and assessment that an opinion could be provided as to his long term risk.” 
         
        
       
     130 His Honour commented that Associate Professor Hayes seemed more optimistic than Dr Nielssen about the benefit of counselling.  
      
       
     131 His Honour noted that the respondent has been undergoing regular psychological counselling since his return to custody.  
      
       
     132 Ultimately, his Honour recognised that the case presented as “a most difficult sentencing exercise”. His Honour concluded that it was not a case calling for the imposition of the maximum sentence. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “While the similarities between the murders of Ms Michael and Ms Newland are chilling, the differences between them are significant. Unlike Ms Newland, the killing of Ms Michael was spontaneous and was the product of the complex of emotions to which I have referred. Even though it was perpetrated by a man who had killed before and was an escapee from prison, it does not share the heinousness of the crimes with which the Court of Criminal Appeal was dealing in  
         Harris  
         or the cases to which reference was made in that decision.” 
         
        
       
     133 His Honour thus concluded that justice would best be served by the imposition of a lengthy determinate sentence. His Honour considered that the respondent has a reasonable prospect of rehabilitation. His Honour accepted that the respondent is now remorseful and “disturbed and ashamed” by his crime. He pleaded guilty to murder after his legal advisers had considered possible defences, and tendered him appropriate advice. 
      
       
     134 His Honour noted that it was not an early plea of guilty, but nevertheless the circumstances required a discount for the plea of guilty which his Honour assessed at about ten per cent. 
      
       
     135 Taking all relevant matters into account, apart from the utilitarian value of the respondent’s plea of guilty, his Honour considered that the murder called for a sentence in the order of twenty-eight years. Allowing a discount for the plea of guilty his Honour reduced that sentence to twenty-five years.  
      
       
     136 His Honour found special circumstances arising from the accumulation of sentences and the need for the respondent to be subject to the sanction of parole for an extended period and thus set a non-parole period of nineteen years. 
      
       
     137 I turn then to the submissions on this appeal by Mr Maxwell QC for the Crown, in support of the Crown case that a sentence of life imprisonment should have been imposed.  
      
       
     138 The statutory basis upon which a court can sentence for life imprisonment is to be found in s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder, if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.” 
         
        
       
     139 In Harris (at par 87) this Court doubted whether the test under s 61 is effectively any different from the common law concept the “worst case category” which was explained in Regina v Twala (unreported, NSWCCA 4 November 1994) as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “In order to characterise any case as being in the worst case category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed).” 
         
        
       
     140 Certainly there is no disharmony between the concepts. In any event, the Crown submitted that this case falls within s 61(1) and can also be categorised pursuant to the common law as a “worst category” case.  
      
       
     141 It was argued by the Crown that Hidden J erred in a number of respects. Firstly it was contended that he failed adequately to take into account the significance of the respondent escaping from custody and then committing murder. Although his Honour referred to the fact that the respondent had committed the subject murder, as an escapee whilst serving the term of imprisonment imposed for the first murder, it was argued that his Honour erroneously failed to view it as a feature of substantial aggravation in the murder. 
      
       
     142 It was submitted that the essence of sentencing philosophy is that after the application of proper principles a court may impose a term of imprisonment for a particular offence. The expectation of the community is that such sentence will be served. The reason the respondent was in gaol is because of that particular offence. To escape and commit the same offence really defeats the whole basis of sentencing. It is a complete breach of community expectations of sentencing. As this Court said in R v Camilleri (unreported, 8 February 1990) the fundamental purpose of punishment is the protection of society. 
      
       
     143 It was further submitted that to escape and kill in circumstances “chillingly similar”, to the murder for which the respondent was serving his sentence should be reflected with substantial retribution and deterrence as part of the sentence. The second murder has very great significance in the light of the first murder. Even if the second murder had no similarities to the first it would be a matter of extreme aggravation but where there are similarities, as here, it assumes even more significance. The second murder emphasised the inability on the part of the respondent to accept rejection. 
      
       
     144 Next it was argued that his Honour failed to take into account as a matter of aggravation the respondent’s awareness of his capacity to kill, when assessing the objective criminality involved in the subject murder. 
      
       
     145 The Crown accepted that his Honour did advert to this factor, but in a context differently, it was argued, to viewing it simply as a feature of aggravation. His Honour referred to this suggested awareness in terms of an argument by the Crown that the respondent knew that if confronted by a situation where Ms Michael was with another man, he would kill her. His Honour found against that argument.  
      
       
     146 Accepting that it was very unusual for this Court to accept error in fact finding by the sentencing judge, it was submitted that this Court should nevertheless conclude that Hidden J erred in rejecting such argument.  
      
       
     147 It was submitted that the passage from the letter written by the respondent to Ms Michael on 19 January 1999, to which Hidden J referred, was cogent evidence supporting the Crown case. I shall refer to this passage as “the critical passage”. 
      
       
     148 Next it was argued that his Honour failed adequately to reflect the extent to which the respondent’s “dominating and possessive personality” played a part in the murder, in terms both of objective criminality and future dangerousness. 
      
       
     149 It was argued that whilst his Honour adverted to this, his Honour appeared to find that the “betrayal” by the deceased could be seen as a mitigating factor. Thus his Honour appears to have found that the rationale for the murder was that the respondent had been tricked into escaping because of lies told by the deceased and then confronted with this betrayal upon his early return from Queensland. Thus it was said his Honour erroneously distinguished the second murder from the first. 
      
       
     150 The Crown submitted, however, that in both murders it was the “dominating and possessive personalty” that operated to cause the respondent to kill the person he viewed as his possession, when that person had “betrayed him”. 
      
       
     151 This is the real similarity between the two cases, the Crown argued, and his Honour had erred when he reduced the significance of the second murder by virtue of this asserted distinction.  
      
       
     152 For the above reasons it was contended that his Honour failed adequately to reflect the “chilling similarity”, of the second murder to the first, in terms of objective seriousness and future dangerousness. 
      
       
     153 Finally, it was argued that his Honour failed adequately to take into account community protection. Although his Honour addressed the question of community protection when he noted that, along with retribution and deterrence, the question of the protection of society loomed large in this case. This led his Honour to consider the expert evidence about the respondent’s prognosis. His Honour ultimately concluded (wrongly, it was argued) that the respondent had a reasonable prospect of rehabilitation. His Honour said in that regard,  
      
       
        
         
         “With maturation over the period which he must now serve in prison, together with continued counselling and the pursuit of his artistic endeavours, I have some hope that he will not re-offend upon his release.” 
         
        
       
     154 His Honour appears to have accepted the evidence of the respondent that at the time of the escape the respondent believed that the relationship was still on foot. Further that the respondent and Ms Michael had discussed moving interstate with the children and starting a new life. 
      
       
     155 The Crown argued that the evidence did not support that conclusion and relied heavily upon a letter dated 9 June 1999, which was the last communication between them prior to the escape. 
      
       
     156 The letter is self-explanatory, and I quote it in full: 
      
       
        
         
         “9th June 99 
          
          
         Dear Nadine, 
         
        
        
         
         Well I haven’t had a letter from you in a couple of weeks, so I thought I’d write and ask why. Not wanting to visit me is one thing, but now with you not writing, does this mean you don’t want to know me at all? I hope this is not the case. From day one I was on your side, I have thrown away a friendship with Steve and Trish whom I have known for 8 years, and this does not phase me provided, your still going to be by my side one day. I’m against them because they are against you, but I’m sure you’ve never doubted my sincerity or loyalty for you. Anyway, what I’m saying is, it would be nice to hear from you. I know you feel bad because you haven’t kept any promises, but it’s ok, no-one ever has kept their promises to me. I’m no longer going to ask you to visit, I will just get along without seeing you, but I would still like you to write, all the time. It’s not going to hurt you to write me a few lines to let me know you care. Who do I always seem to be sitting down writing to, let me tell you it’s you alone. I don’t even know if you got my last letter 2 weeks ago when I put one if for Geoff as well. I understand if you’ve just been busy, but even a small one I’ll be happy with. By the way, do you have the phone on there, I won’t ring myself as I know you wouldn’t want me to, but it would be good to be able to get a message through to you, via my mum or someone, if I needed to. Why have you turned away from me Nadine? Anyway like I say, I’m not going to ask in vain any longer for you to come and be with me as it’s obvious whoever you are with at the moment is better because they are not in gaol and I can appreciate that, so I’m not expecting you to visit any more I don’t want to spoil the relationship you have at the moment, but at least leave some doors open for us, in case things don’t work out. It’s not going to hurt for you to write to me, it just leaves the opportunity open for you to one day think to yourself ‘Danny is out now, I might go and see him’. So this is all I ask of you, don’t let us drift apart forever, just write to me every now and then and tell me you’re thinking of me, I’ll be happy with that. And regardless of what you do and say, my words I told you will remain true, now and forever. 
         
        
        
         
         And they are that I love you. 
         
        
        
         
          Danny.” 
         
        
       
     157 For the above reasons, the Crown submitted that the sentence which his Honour imposed was manifestly inadequate and the second murder was one of a kind contemplated by s 61(1). Thus by not giving life imprisonment his Honour imposed a sentence which was manifestly inadequate. Alternatively, it was argued, but not with the same emphasis, that a longer determinate sentence should have been imposed. 
      
       
     158 These submissions were resolutely faced by Mr Bodor QC for the respondent.  
      
       
     159 In considering the Crown submissions it is pertinent to refer to certain parts of the report by Dr Nielssen, other than those to which reference has already been made. Dr Nielssen asked the respondent about his reaction to seeing Ms Michael with another man on the bed. The respondent’s response was: 
      
       
        
         
         “I had been awake for five nights and I was excited to be back. It was not jealousy, it was betrayal. I realised it was all lies and that I had been manipulated to escape. It was more than anger … the realisation hit me with enormous impact.” 
         
        
       
     160 When asked why he did not just walk away the respondent replied, “I couldn’t access rational thought … it was gone”. 
      
       
     161 The respondent said he remembered “an overwhelming emotion of rage … I had absolutely no control”. 
      
       
     162 I quote further from Dr Nielssen’s report: 
      
       
        
         
         “He said that his memory of the events that followed remains unclear. He said ‘I walked straight through the glass door cutting tendons in my right hand … I didn’t even realise it until I had trouble getting my hand to work when I was knocking on a door afterwards’. He said that he remembered hearing the man yelling at him to stop. He said he (sic) that he assumed that he attacked Nadine inside the house, and could not remember chasing her into the street. He said that he had no recollection of actually killing her, and could only recalled (sic) fragments of his movements until he knocked on the door a few minutes later. He said that he could not remember if any words were exchanged, although he believes that she did not say anything to him and instead ran away. He said that he could not remember Mr Suna or Nadine’s children shouting at him. 
          
          
         Mr Miles said that he was not affected by any kind of drug. He said that the crime was not identical to the previous offence, as he said the circumstances and reasons for the offences were very different. He said that he had full recollection of the previous offence, and remembered stabbing and attempting to resuscitate his then girlfriend. He said that prior to that offence he had thought about killing her and himself. However, he said on this occasion he lost his temper and the offence occurred on the spur of the moment, in response to his perception of the situation.” 
         
        
       
     163 Dr Nielssen could find no evidence of any kind of thought disorder and no psychiatric condition was detected. He found no objective signs of mental illness or any form of brain damage. He estimated the respondent’s intelligence to be in the average range from his verbal and written expression and his educational attainment. “He showed little concern for Ms Michael, and instead focussed on how she had betrayed him”. 
      
       
     164 Under the paragraph headed “Opinion” Dr Nielssen said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Miles reported mild excitement in the days before the offence, during which he had little sleep. The offence was described as occurring during an uncontrollable rage in response to the sudden realisation that he had been betrayed.” 
         
        
       
     165 The report concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is very troubling to consider that Mr Miles has killed a second woman in similar circumstances, in the absence of a major psychiatric disorder or any discernible brain damage, and despite at least average intelligence. Repeating an offence of this nature is very unusual. Mr Miles maintained that the two offences were quite different. However, there were several obvious similarities in both the relationships and the offences themselves. The relationships were marked by intense contact by telephone and letter, and distress when the other person withdrew from the relationship. There were also similarities in the letters to the victims of both offences, supporting Mr Miles’ assertion that he did not develop emotionally during the nine years he spent in gaol. 
         
        
        
         
         Dr Phillip’s original remarks about Mr Miles’ ability to cope with rejection, and his ability to control his emotional reaction apply just as well to the second offence. Mr Miles did not address the attitudes and personality traits that contributed to the first offence during the nine years he spent in prison between the offences, and there is no guarantee that any form of counselling will change his longstanding personality traits, or reduce his risk of further offences of this nature.” 
         
        
       
     166 The concluding sentence of the passages quoted above is of course a matter of concern. 
      
       
     167 I turn then to the report by Associate Professor Hayes. In addition to the interview generally with the respondent, Associate Professor Hayes conducted psychometric testing. As part of the history she received from the respondent, I note the following passage: 
      
       
        
         
         “He says that the main emotion that he felt as the rage welled up was that he had thrown away eight years of hard work. He says that although he has been in a bad temper in the past, he has never had this kind of rage. He said that it was a different kind of anger completely, because ‘consequences did not matter’ and he could not even comprehend the notion of the consequences of his actions. The rage hit when he was looking in the house through the windows. He felt as if his mind and body were not working in unison, because his mind did not warn his body that he might be hurt when he walked through the glass doors. The rage was directed at Ms Michael, not the man. He does not recall seeing the children. He cannot recall picking up the knife and does not know if the knife was on the sink or in a drawer.” 
         
        
       
     168 With regard to “Interpersonal Scales”, Associate Professor Hayes noted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Miles is average is terms of dominance in terms of interpersonal relationships and also average in terms of warmth.” 
         
        
       
     169 Under the heading, “Personality Profile” she notes:  
      
       
        
         
         “The major elevation was on the scale of Suicidal Ideation and this should be addressed immediately. Apart from that he is calm and effective in dealing with stress. He is currently not showing any symptoms of abnormally raised levels of aggression. In treatment, he would be co-operative and non-manipulative.” 
         
        
       
     170 As to counselling, she reported that the respondent is presently working in the MTTC as a sweeper and wants to remain there because he has built up a professional relationship with the psychologist with whom he is having counselling. He says that over the last eighteen months in counselling, he has dealt with more issues than he did in the previous nine or ten years. He says that he suppressed everything about the first offence but now has opened that door.  
      
       
     171 Under “Summary and Opinion” Associate Professor Hayes reported: 
      
       
        
         
         “The results of psychometric testing indicate that Mr Miles is of average intelligence. There was no abnormality on his personality profile which was consistent with a psychiatric disorder amounting to an abnormality of mind. The only current symptom he has is an elevation on the scale relating to Suicidal Ideation. The personality test indicates that Mr Miles would be a good candidate for treatment and he himself says that he has benefited greatly from 18 months’ counselling with a prison psychologist. 
         
        
        
         
         It appears that Mr Miles had an episode of explosive anger, which appears to be atypical for him, but which nevertheless had tragic results. His reaction was not simply to the fact that he believed that Ms Michael was in bed with another man, but also to his immediate perception that all of his future plans and goals had been betrayed. Whilst the circumstances appear to be emotionally provoking, it is also the case that Mr Miles seemed not to have access to other ways of controlling anger and disappointment, possibly partly as a result of the fact that he received (according to his own report) no appropriate treatment for anger management during the time he spent in prison. Mr Miles needs to deal with both offences in counselling, and learn anger management and interpersonal/relationship skills. I agree with the report of Dr Lucas, in that it is essential that Mr Miles continue to receive psychological assessment and counselling. It is only after lengthy future counselling and assessment that an opinion could be provided as to his long-term risk.” 
         
        
       
     172 It is well established that this Court will interfere with regard to findings of fact by the sentencing judge only if it is demonstrated that the sentencing judge fell into a material error of law and fact, recognising that sentencing judges have a substantial discretion in relation to the view which may be taken of the facts and circumstances of each individual case: see eg R v Warfield (1994) 34 NSWLR 200.  
      
       
     173 The question for this Court is whether this case reaches the level of culpability so extreme as to require a life sentences in terms of s 61(1) and the common law as explained in Twala. This involves an assessment of the respondent’s moral culpability and dangerous propensity. It is pertinent then to consider the following oft-quoted passages from the joint judgment (Mason CJ; Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) in  Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477-478: 
      
       
        
         
         “In this case, Hunt took into account the relevant purposes of criminal punishment in determining the sentence to be imposed. He was entitled to attach great weight to the protection of society as a factor in that determination. 
         
        
        
         
         There are two subsidiary principles which should be mentioned. The first is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences:  
         Director of Public Prosecutions v Ottewell 
          [1970] AC 642 at 650. The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. Counsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner’s claim for leniency. That is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community’s understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties. 
         
        
        
         
         The second subsidiary principle material to this case is that the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence is intended for cases falling within the worst category of cases for which that penalty is prescribed:  
         Ibbs v The Queen 
          (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452. That does not mean that a lesser penalty must be imposed if it be possible to envisage a worse case; ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness. A sentence which imposes the maximum penalty offends this principle only if the case is recognizably outside the worst category.” 
         
        
       
     174 I respectfully find the above passage to be of considerable assistance in the resolution of this case.  
      
       
     175 The particular heinousness of the subject murder has to be assessed in the light of a number of factors. 
      
       
     176 The respondent was at the time of his escape serving a lengthy sentence for the murder of a young woman, which offence contained a number of disturbing aspects. It was a brutal murder of a defenceless young woman, motivated by the respondent’s jealousy and desire for revenge for having been rejected by a young woman whose romantic interest at the relevant time reposed elsewhere than in the respondent. It was on the respondent’s own admission the consequence of “a sudden burst of anger”.  
      
       
     177 Mathews J imposed a relatively lenient sentence in that she fixed a minimum term of twelve and a half years and allowed an additional period of five and a half years for the supervision and rehabilitation of the respondent by the Probation and Parole Service. Thus a considerable degree of trust was imposed by her Honour in the respondent. 
      
       
     178 One must acknowledge, of course, the creditworthy manner in which the respondent behaved during the period he served in custody. On the other hand, it was only after he had served less than nine years that he resolved to escape when he was granted the concession of a minimum security classification. Further, irrespective of how realistic it was, the respondent’s intention was clearly to avoid detection and remain at large resident in another State.  
      
       
     179 A large number of letters written by the respondent to Ms Michael were tendered in evidence. They demonstrate an infatuation both emotional and physical which the respondent had for her. The same obsessive element was present as in his relationship with Ms Newland. However, at times he remonstrated with Ms Michael. The particular aspects of Ms Michael’s murder must then be considered. Not surprisingly, a focal point of the Crown’s submission is the critical passage quoted above from the letter dated 19 January 1999 in which the respondent adverts to Ms Newland’s murder in what can only realistically be looked upon as a threat to Ms Michael. Unhappily that threat came to pass.  
      
       
     180 Ms Michael’s murder was associated with the most disturbing aspects. The sight of another man on Ms Michael’s bed enraged the respondent so that he violently broke into her home and thereupon, having seized her, possessed himself of the same type of weapon with which he had murdered Ms Newland. Attempts by one of Ms Michael’s daughters to restrain him were met with violence and, Ms Michael, having attempted to escape, was pursued and stabbed to death when the respondent was clearly in a state of frenzy. The fact that the murder took place within the sight of the children of Ms Michael certainly adds to its heinousness.  
      
       
     181 When interviewed by police officers in relation to the second murder, the respondent almost replicated his explanation in relation to Ms Newland’s death. 
      
       
     182 As has already been indicated, when asked to relate the circumstances surrounding the death of Ms Newland, the respondent replied,  
      
       
        
         
         “… I kept telling her how much I loved her and she just kept talking about her boyfriend. My anger was so strong I pulled a knife from the back of my jeans and used it on her.” 
         
        
       
     183 He also said in answer to that question “She was talking about her boyfriend and I was becoming very jealous and angry” (Q29). Later he was asked to explain what he meant by the answer, “I pulled a knife from the back of my jeans and used it on her”. The respondent replied, “Well it’s like I say, it was a sudden burst of anger and it was totally without thought. It was reaction that I just did, I just pulled the knife and put it wherever it went, I stabbed her” (Q49). 
      
       
     184 So far as substantial retribution and deterrence is concerned, I have referred to the submissions of the Crown (with which it is not possible to disagree), that the essence of sentencing philosophy is that after application of proper principles a court may impose a term of imprisonment for a particular offence and the expectation of the community is that such sentence will be served.  
      
       
     185 The conduct of the respondent in this case amounted, therefore, to an affront of the administration of the criminal law and the punishment of offenders. The criminal courts must be seen to protect and preserve the system from affronts of this nature, otherwise there must necessarily be a loss of confidence by the community in the administration of the criminal justice system. The system, includes of course, the punishment and attempted rehabilitation of prisoners through the operation of the Corrective Services Department.  
      
       
     186 I turn then specifically to the asserted dangerousness of the respondent.  
      
       
     187 In the following evidence before the sentencing judge, Dr Nielssen, in chief, amplified aspects of his report: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you have any other material on that subject past psychiatric history if any? 
          
         A. Again the reports listed there relating to the earlier trial, the reports by Dr Clark, Dr Jonathan Philips, and Dr Don Tran, and there’s also a psychological report by Dr Roberts who holds a Doctor of Philosophy Degree. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And were you able to find any evidence of psychiatric illness at any time in his past or indeed at the present time? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what you have however indicated on diagnosis is that he could be described as having borderline narcissistic and paranoid personality traits. What in essence does that mean? 
          
         A. It’s – I’ve used the terms ‘traits’ rather than the term ‘personalities (sic) disorder’ in the sense that I did not have enough evidence from the life history and the corroborative history of which there was a large amount of that he would meet the objective criteria for the diagnosis for the diagnosis of any personality disorder. Those traits refer to borderline meaning unstable, feeling rejection, impulsive perhaps self defeating, narcissistic referring perhaps to being grandiose, having reduced capacity for empathy, preoccupation with physical appearance and achievements, and paranoid meaning suspicious, quick to take offence, untrusting. Those were the consolation (sic) of personality traits that emerged largely from the corroborative information rather than from the history but from the examination but confirmed in examination to some degree. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. On the last page, page 8, you’ve expressed a view as to future dangerousness in effect have you not? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And in that opinion, the original remarks of Dr Philips the psychiatrist have been of importance to you, is that right? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Doctor Philips having reported in the early 90’s that the first murder reflected an inability of the prisoner to cope with rejection and an inability to control his emotional reaction, do you see those two factors operating pretty much in the same way in relation to this murder? 
          
         A. Yes, there was a – I thought there was a strong similarity in his emotional response even if some of the circumstances were different. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you say that nothing that was or no attempt was made to address those problems during the nine years that he spent in prison prior to the second murder? 
          
         A. To be fair to Mr Miles it was – it was not so much no attempt on his part but no attempt on the programme (sic) within Corrective Services to identify him as having a particular need or provide him with treatment. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is it your view that counselling of some type could reduce the risk of him committing a similar offence if ever released again? 
          
         A. I – yes it is my view that it could change him but I can’t promise it. I can’t guarantee that it would be any change. There’s just no – I was trying to think for a moment of any evidence of the affect [sic] of treatment on people with these sorts of personality abnormal personality traits and the current view is that there is little affect [sic]. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That counselling would have little affect [sic] is that -  
          
         A. No, it’s not guaranteed to change those traits over time over and above the natural maceration [maturation] that would take place. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Do you distinguish Doctor between treatment and counselling? 
          
         A. Your Honour I think the only treatment indicated would be intensive counselling.” 
         
        
       
     188 It is of course of significance that Dr Nielssen could see a strong similarity in the respondent’s emotional response insofar as the second murder is concerned to the emotional response described by Dr Philips in relation to the first murder. It is acknowledged of course that there were some circumstances which were different but on the other hand there were many circumstances which were similar. The similar circumstances, in my view, predominated.  
      
       
     189 In re-examination, Dr Nielssen confirmed that there was no evidence that counselling programmes work on personalities such as those of the respondent. Dr Nielssen said there was plenty of evidence that certain types of instructional counselling will help symptoms of depression but the conclusions of the literature on the subject were that there was little influence on personality, particularly in anti-social and paranoid personality. The respondent of course falls into the latter personality category. 
      
       
     190 During the course of the respondent’s evidence before the sentencing judge, he was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Maxwell QC, as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I want to show you a copy of a letter and first off can you say whether it is your letter? (Letter shown.) It is marked ‘K’ in the material, I think it is tab 3. It has a ‘K’ in the right-hand corner and the page number is 6. Do you have that, Mr Miles? 
          
         A. Yes, I do, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you see there, there is a highlighted part: ‘So why are you continuing to treat me with utter disrespect? do you have that part? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What does that say, the next sentence? ‘Here’? After ‘disrespect’? 
          
         A. ‘Honestly’. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. ‘Honestly babe, you’re lucky you’re not a bloke or I would have broke your jaw’. Is that what you said to her?  
          
         A. Yes, that is what is written there, that I wrote. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. ‘In fact I’ve broke bloke’s jaws for less than that’? 
          
         A. If I may say on that, that is, you know, obviously she is never going to be a bloke, so -- 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Please just take each question as it comes. Your counsel will have the opportunity to re-examine you if necessary. 
         
        
        
         
         MAXWELL: Q. So you say because she is not a bloke, that is not really a threat that is directed to her, is that right?  
          
         A. Yes. She is never going to be a bloke, it is a hypothetical - 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So it is not something you think she would worry about? 
          
         A. No, I don’t. Also, if I may say sir, this letter, you can sort out the writing, how messy it is. It is different from the other letters because this was written under the influence of sleeping pills which a number of letters are. I’d like to make that point. You can tell by the messy writing, spelling mistakes, it is just utter rubbish. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. On this question of threats, you say you never threatened her, right? Do you accept that? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Could I take you to a letter apparently written as part of a series of letters written, starting on Tuesday 19 January. That is marked 4, your Honour. (Letter shown.) It is page 14. About a quarter of the way down the page, even less than that, do you see the words ‘I know you have a lot of confusion.’ Do you see that, about the sixth or eight lines? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, first of all do you accept that that is your letter? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And is that apparently in January of 1999? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you appear to have read these letters recently, is that right? 
          
         A. I haven’t read them all, I’ve read some. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You seem to have a good knowledge of the details of some of them, would you accept that? 
          
         A. Some of them, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say ‘But for fuck’s sake, would you just turn to me. Tell me everything and trust me’. See that? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you having some difficulties in the relationship at that time? 
          
         A. Yes, I believe so, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What, she wasn’t contacting you, or you felt she was lying to you, or any of those? 
          
         A. Yes. I think that was in regards to her expressing that she didn’t believe that I really loved her and I wasn’t treating her like a wife. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did that upset you? 
          
         A. It didn’t upset me – oh, yes, it upset me but I tried to explain to her that I was serious about her and I was genuine in the promises I make. I was asking her to trust me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So it did upset you? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Enough to hurt her? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Enough to do something to her? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, you then go on to say ‘I do things babe, I’m not a talker/’ See that? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did you mean by that? 
          
         A. That means when I make a promise, it’s not words, I will carry it through. When I say I love her and I’ll do things for her, that is exactly what I mean I’ll do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Could it have meant that if you told your partner what you wanted and she didn’t do it, that you would do something to hurt her? 
          
         A. No, it couldn’t mean that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Couldn’t have meant that? 
          
         A. No. not at all. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You go on to say ‘Just ask Donna’? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who is Donna? 
          
         A. Donna was my first girlfriend, related to the first offence. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say ‘When I told her to stop playing games with my heart or I would put a hole in her heart’, right? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you say that is a threat to Nadine? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Not at all? 
          
         A. No, if I may -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You are clearly threatening her? 
          
         A. No I’m not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You are clearing [sic] telling her if she won’t stop playing with you, you will do to her what you did to Donna. 
          
         A. No. If I may explain, it is an indefensible analogy, and it is a disgusting one at that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It is one you used? 
          
         A. Yes, but it didn’t mean what you are suggesting. It simply means when I make a promise, and I say I’m going to do something, I do it. If I said I would marry her and, and made other promises in addition to that, it meant that I would keep them and I would not let her down. People in her past had let her down, they treated her very badly and she had been abused in the past. Or that was my belief, anyway. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see, in that letter, that bit that I’ve just read to you, I suggest it is as clear as a bell that if Nadine doesn’t stop playing games with you, you were threatening to do to her what you did to Donna. Do you deny it? 
          
         A. I guarantee that is not what it says, I guarantee it is not what it means. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It is just unfortunate that you used it? 
          
         A. No, it is not unfortunate, it is disgusting that I used it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What prompted you to use it, then? 
          
         A. Probably frustration, and again with this letter here that has been picked out, it’s a messy written one which is also under the influence of sleeping pills, which I guess I can’t fully put the blame on the sleeping pills but it is a disgusting analogy, as I said, and I never saying anything disrespectful against Donna which I have here, but it doesn’t mean what you suggest, sir.” 
         
        
       
     191 In this context it is relevant to consider pars 25 and 26 of his Honour’s remarks on sentence (part of which I have already quoted): 
      
       
        
         
         “25. The Crown Prosecutor acknowledged that this killing was not premeditated. In particular, he did not suggest that the offender had escaped with the intention of killing Ms Michael if he found her with another man. On the other hand, he argued that he must have been aware of his propensity to react violently to rejection and must have foreseen the possibility of his inflicting violence upon Ms Michael if his worst fears were realised. I can see the force of that argument, particularly in the light of the passages from his letters to which I have referred, but I would hesitate to make that finding. Disturbing as to those passages in the letters are, I incline to the view that they were rhetorical. In any event, I doubt that the offender had sufficient self awareness at that time to have the insight for which the Crown contended. 
         
        
        
         
         26. The Crown Prosecutor also argued that this killing, like that of Ms Newland, was purely the result of the offender’s inability to accept rejection. In effect, said the Crown Prosecutor, he killed Ms Michael because he had decided that, if he could not have her, no-one else would. However, I consider that his emotional response at the time was more complex than that. No doubt his violent reaction was the product of his dominating and possessive personality, but I accept that he was also moved by his sense of betrayal and his belief that he had squandered everything which he had gained during his imprisonment.” 
         
        
       
     192 His Honour was responding in par 25 to a submission to him by the Crown Prosecutor that the respondent’s escape could not be viewed as a plan to escape in order to kill Ms Michael but it could be viewed “as a plan to escape with a possibility that if she is doing something behind his back, if she is, in his view, two timing him, the possibility is that he will exercise the capacity that he knows he has, and he has stated in the letter that he put a hole in [Ms Newland’s] heart and that’s exactly what he did to [Ms Michael]”. This submission was at the forefront of the Crown’s submission before Hidden J and also before the Court. 
      
       
     193 When his Honour categorised the disturbing passages as “rhetorical”, I assume he was using that adjective in the sense of artificial or extravagant language. The word has, of course, more than one meaning. 
      
       
     194 However, with respect, the events which happened demonstrate that the respondent meant what he said. One can only determine what is in a person’s mind by what he or she says and does. Here, there was a harmony between what the respondent wrote and what he did. 
      
       
     195 His Honour rejected the Crown’s argument that the killing of Ms Michael, like that of Ms Newland, was purely the result of the respondent’s inability to accept rejection. His Honour went on to express the view that his violent reaction was the product of his “dominating and possessive personality” and that he was also moved by his sense of betrayal and his belief that he had squandered everything which he had gained during his imprisonment. A question arises as to whether there is any real difference between his Honour’s conclusion and the Crown submission that the respondent’s conduct was the result of an inability to accept rejection.  
      
       
     196 It is clear from the passages which I have already quoted from Associate Professor Hayes’ report that she was more optimistic about the possible benefits of future counselling than Dr Nielssen. She thought that it was only after lengthy future counselling and assessment that an opinion could be provided as to the respondent’s long term risk. Thus an element of uncertainty remains. 
      
       
     197 There is no evidence before this Court as to whether either Dr Nielssen or Associate Professor Hayes was aware of the terms of the letter which contains the critical passage upon which the Crown so heavily relies. It would appear that they did not. However, the position is not clear. 
      
       
     198 With the greatest respect to the learned sentencing judge I do not consider that he gave the disturbing passages in the respondent’s letters the emphasis to which they were entitled. It did not require much insight on the part of the respondent, in the light of the disturbing passages, to conclude that the he must have been aware of a propensity to react violently to rejection and to have foreseen the possibility of his inflicting violence on Ms Michael if his worst fears were realised. For myself, I thought the respondent’s attempts to explain away those passages during the course of his cross-examination were inadequate.  
      
       
     199 When one looks at the totality of the evidence, the circumstances of the first murder, the correspondence with Ms Michael, the planned escape from the Corrective Services system, the circumstances of the second murder and the psychiatric and psychological evidence, one is driven to the conclusion that the second murder was not “an uncharacteristic aberration”, but rather a “continuing attitude of disobedience of the law”, to apply the expressions in Veen.  
      
       
     200 Thus, as Veen requires, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. Relevantly, the evidence demonstrates a dangerous propensity on the part of the respondent which shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter him and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind, again to use the words of Veen. The conclusion is unavoidable, in my view, that the respondent was well aware of his capacity to kill if subjected to what he considered to be betrayal. 
      
       
     201 This takes me to a primary legal argument on behalf of the Crown. It was argued that the terms of s 61(1) are such that if the criteria therein set out are satisfied then subjective circumstances can have no relevance. This submission must, in my view be rejected. It is not consistent with well established sentencing principles and cannot stand with the judgment of this Court in Harris. In that case the Court considered the subjective circumstances at pages 425-426 and at par 105 concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “For the reasons already mentioned, I am of the view that the present case is one that answers this description with the consequence that the subjective circumstances could not displace the need for life sentences.” 
         
        
       
     202 The reference by Wood CJ at CL to “this description” is a reference to remarks by Abadee J in R v Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 533 at 544-545 in which his Honour referred to the fact that in some cases falling within the category of the worst class of cases, there is little utility in considering the prospects of rehabilitation and the subjective circumstances generally. 
      
       
     203 In other words the appalling objective circumstances may completely overwhelm whatever subjective circumstances there may be, which include the prospects of rehabilitation.  
      
       
     204 There is a two stage process involved in determining whether a life sentence is mandated. The Court must first determine whether on the objective facts the level of culpability is so extreme that it warrants the maximum penalty. The Court must then determine whether the subjective factors are capable of displacing the prima facie need for the maximum penalty. 
      
       
     205 There is no convincing evidence in this case of a realistic prospect for the rehabilitation of the respondent. It is true that during his incarceration prior to the second murder he behaved well and applied himself to his musical training and applied it usefully. However, those good works were necessarily diminished by the circumstances of the escape. A subjective factor is, of course, his relative youth. The plea of guilty must also be considered. 
      
       
     206 In considering whether this matter came within the “worst case” principle, reference was made to a number of other cases in which life sentences have been imposed since 1990. One is mindful of course that the test is not whether the subject murder is the “worst case” but whether it can fall within the category of “being in the worst case category”. As explained in Twala this requires particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime as distinct from the subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed.  
      
       
     207 Mr Bodor QC for the respondent submitted that the instant case could not be categorised as having the same degree of heinousness as any of the twenty-one cases in which natural life sentences have been imposed since 1990.  
      
       
     208 The comparison of cases of course does have limited assistance. That is nevertheless an exercise worth undertaking. One notes of course that in the table of cases provided some sentences followed a verdict of the jury and others a plea of guilty. The present case, of course, falls within the latter category. Interestingly counsel were unable to refer the Court to any prior case where the offender was guilty of a murder having escaped from gaol serving a sentence for a prior murder. In that regard this case has distinctive features.  
      
       
     209 There is some similarity between the present case and that of R v Garforth (unreported, CCA 23 May 1994) in that in both cases, there was no psychiatric evidence indicative of an abnormality of the mind leading to the relevant murder. However, as the Court (Gleeson CJ, McInerney and Mathews JJ) held there are some cases in which the circumstances of an offence on their own suggest the possibility of dangerousness, and Garforth was, their Honours held, one such case. Their Honours said in this regard: 
      
       
        
         
         “The nature of the applicant’s actions leads to a question whether he might act similarly in the future. In the present state of the evidence, no finding adverse to him can be made on this matter. However, by the same token, he cannot obtain a favourable finding on the issue.” 
         
        
       
     210 That principle is relevant to the instant case. Garforth  was, I note, a case where the offender was sentenced to life in respect of only one murder having been committed. Albeit there was a serious sexual assault of his young victim prior to the murder. Fernando, to which I have already referred, involved only one murder but again a sexual assault was involved. There was, however, a lengthy prior criminal history. 
      
       
     211 In my view therefore, whether viewed by reference to s 61(1) or the common law, the instant murder was one which, allowing for the subjective circumstances, nevertheless reached a level of heinousness which mandated a life sentence. It was classically a case where the level of culpability of the respondent in the commission of the offence by reason of the various circumstances to which reference has fully been made, was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence could only be met through the imposition of that sentence. In this regard I have had due regard to the principle of double jeopardy and to the discretion which attaches to Crown appeals against leniency of sentence as explained in R v Allpass (1994) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562-563. However in this case, as in Harris, in my view the criminality of the respondent and the level of dangerousness are such that notwithstanding the principles relating to Crown appeals, it is necessary for the Court to intervene. The only subjective feature of any note, in my view, is the relative youth of the respondent. However, despite his youth he has killed twice in nine years. I note that Harris was about the same age as the respondent. 
      
       
     212 In my view this case is one in which the sentence imposed at first instance displayed a leniency of such a magnitude that error should be assumed. With the greatest respect, his Honour failed, in my view, to give sufficient weight to the factors relied on by the Crown to demonstrate the high level of criminal culpability involved: see Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 339-340. 
      
       
     213 There are two final matters to which reference should be made. The first is the fact that the respondent pleaded guilty. In the circumstances of this case no allowance can be made in that regard. The law acknowledges that there are crimes which so offend the public interest that the maximum sentence without any discount for the plea of guilty, is appropriate: see eg R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2, cited in R v Thomson [2000] 49 NSWLR 383 at par 157. 
      
       
     214 The second matter is the principle of double jeopardy. Bearing in mind the criminality of the respondent and the level of his dangerousness, it is, in my view, necessary for this Court to intervene and impose a life sentence, despite the well-established principles relating to Crown appeals: see Harris at par 137. 
      
       
     215 Thus I would propose that the sentence imposed by Hidden J be quashed and in lieu thereof the respondent should be sentenced to imprisonment for life to date from 25 April 2005. The Court does not have jurisdiction to fix a non-parole period. It is necessary to date the life sentence from 25 April 2005 to comply with s 57(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: see R v Robinson [2000] NSWCCA 182 at par 49.

      NSW Crime Commission v O B & Anor 
       
       
      Judgment 
       
      
    1 His Honour: On 16 August 2001, O B (hereafter “the applicant”) was arrested and charged with the following offences: 
     
     Supply prohibited drug cocaine indictable quantity (x4); 
     Supply prohibited drug amphetamine indictable quantity; 
     Permit premises to be used as drug premises; 
     Organise conduct assist drug premises; 
     Goods in custody 
       
        
       The applicant has been in custody since that time, bail refused. Committal proceedings are fixed to commence on 19 August 2002 at the Wollongong Local Court. 
        
       
    2 On the date of his arrest, a restraining order was made pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (“the Act”) in relation to all interests in property of the applicant, including monies in account number 8114-102941-600 with the Arab Bank of Australia, Campsie, and account number 012-878 2597-28025 with the ANZ Bank, Wollongong. 
     
      
    3 The applicant has now applied for an order pursuant to s 10(5)b of the Act which provides that, subject to s 16A of the Act, a restraining order may, at the time it is made or at a later time, make provision for meeting out of the property or a specified part of the property to which the order applies the reasonable legal expenses of any person whose interests in the property are subject to the restraining order, being expenses incurred in defending a criminal charge. 
     
      
    4 Section 16A(1) provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The following restrictions apply to a restraining order making provision for the payment of any legal expenses of a person: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) no provision is to be made except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied that the person cannot meet the expenses concerned out of the person's unrestrained property, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) no provision is to be made in relation to any particular interest in property if the Supreme Court is satisfied that the interest is illegally acquired property, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) no provision is to be made unless a Statement of Affairs disclosing all the person's interests in property and liabilities and verified on oath by the person has been filed with the Supreme Court, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) no provision is to be made unless the Supreme Court is satisfied that the person has taken all reasonable steps to bring all of the person's interests in property within the jurisdiction of the Court, 
        
       
       
        
        (e) any such provision must specify the particular interest in property out of which the expenses concerned may be met. 
        
       
      
    5 “Unrestrained property” is defined in s 16A(2) as 
     
      
       
        
        any interest in property of the person: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that is not subject to a restraining order under this Act, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that the Supreme Court is satisfied is not within the Court's jurisdiction (whether or not it is subject to a restraining order under this Act), or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) that the Supreme Court is satisfied would not be available to satisfy a proceeds assessment order against the person (assuming such an order were to be made against the person). 
        
       
      
    6 Section 9 of the Act includes the following definition of “illegally acquired property”: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) An interest in property is serious crime derived property if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) it was wholly or partly acquired using serious crime derived property. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) … 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The meaning of illegally acquired property is ascertained by substituting, in subsections (1)-(3), illegally acquired property for serious crime derived property and illegal activity for serious crime related activity. 
        
       
       
      This means that, in the case of a bank account, if illegally obtained money has been contributed to the fund, the whole of it constitutes illegally acquired property. 
       
      
    7 On the hearing of the application before me, Mr Steirn SC and Mr Jones of counsel appeared for the applicant. Mr Temby QC and Mr Bromwich of counsel appeared for the respondent, NSW Crime Commission (hereafter “the Commission”). 
     
      
    8 A non-publication order pursuant to s 62 of the Act was sought by Mr Steirn SC on the first day of the hearing. I made an order prohibiting publication of the name of the applicant or of any evidence in the present proceedings or of any other matter relating to them which would tend to identify him. Thus, in this judgment, the applicant and members of his family are referred to by initials. 
     
      
    9 In the applicant’s case, the affidavits sworn by the applicant and Mr William Stanley Whitby (the applicant’s solicitor) were read. The applicant was cross-examined.  
     
      
    10 In the Commission’s case, affidavits sworn by the following persons were read: 
     
     Senior Constable B I Wyber, a plain clothes officer in the New South Wales Police Service; 
     Senior Constable D G Kelly, a plain clothes officer in the New South Wales Police Service; 
     Constable M R O’Sullivan, an officer in the New South Wales Police Service; 
     Ms T L Williamson; 
     Mr S Karakira, an interpreter / translator of Arabic - English; 
     Detective Senior Constable D J Fleming, an officer in the New South Wales Police Service. 
       
        
       Of these persons, Detective Fleming gave short oral evidence by leave and was cross-examined.  
        
       
    11 Documents, transcripts of intercepted telephone calls and two video tape recordings were also tendered by the Commission. Extracts from the recordings of telephone conversations and from the video tapes were played over to the court. 
     
      
    12 It was the Commission’s case that the court is precluded from making an order as sought by reason of the restrictions prescribed by s 16A(1). In particular, it was submitted that the court would not be satisfied that the applicant cannot meet the expenses concerned out of unrestrained property (which would have to be property outside the jurisdiction since property of the applicant within the jurisdiction is the subject of the restraining order) (para (a)), that the court would be satisfied that the interest in property the subject of the restraining order, in particular the money in the bank accounts, is illegally acquired property (para (b)), and that the court would not be satisfied that the applicant had taken all reasonable steps to bring all of his interests in property within the jurisdiction of the court (para (d)). 
     
      
    13 In relation to paras (a) and (d) of s 16A(1), concerning which the burden of proof was on the applicant, the Commission’s case was that the court would not be satisfied that what the applicant said in those respects was true. It was asserted that the applicant was so discredited in the evidence which he gave that the court would not accept anything said by him in his own interests unless corroborated by objectively acceptable evidence. 
     
      
    14 In relation to paragraph (b) of s 16A(1), concerning which the Commission bore the burden of proof, the Commission’s case was that the court would be affirmatively satisfied that money constituted by or at least contributed to the funds in the bank account was illegally acquired. 
     
      
    15 The applicant’s evidence led in support of the application can be summarised as follows. For a time prior to his arrest, the applicant was living for part of the time at premises in Church Street, Wollongong, and for part of the time in a house property at Mount St Thomas (hereafter “the house”). The house was owned by the applicant’s mother who resided at the property spasmodically during that period. The applicant’s father had died some time earlier. The only other regular occupant of the house, on the evidence, was a nephew of the applicant, then aged about 13. It appears that other persons who were friends of the applicant and, perhaps, relatives were on these premises overnight from time to time. There was no evidence that any person other than the applicant, his mother and his nephew were regular occupants of the house. 
     
      
    16 In his affidavit in support of his application, the applicant said: 
     
      
       
        
        3. The monies that I seek access for my reasonable legal expenses are those currently held in my cash management account number 8114-102941-600 (Australian dollars) with the Arab Bank at Campsie. The balance of that account as at 31 December 2001 was $152,328.28. Annexed hereto and marked with the letter “A” is a copy of my bank account statements for account number 8114-102941-600 for the period 17 February 2000 to 31 December 2001. 
        
       
       
      (Annexure A consisted of a series of monthly statements issued by the Arab Bank in relation to account number 8114-102941-600, from 17 February 2000 to 31 December 2001.) 
       
       
        
        4. The monies held in my account number 8114-102941-600 is made up substantially of two deposits of money I received from my brother  
        [A B]  
        of Syria. The first such deposit was on or about 22 February 1999 in the sum of US$34,875.00. These monies were sent to the Arab Bank of Australia by Mr Fadel Issa who is a friend of my brother’s  
        [A B]. 
         Annexed hereto. Annexed hereto and marked with the letter “B” is a copy of Notice from the Arab Bank Australia confirming receipt of $34,875.00 by the Arab Bank Australia on my behalf. At that time I had a bank account number 8114-102941-457 with the Arab Bank in Australian dollars. 
        
       
       
      Annexure B to the applicant’s affidavit was a record of a SWIFT bank-to-bank transfer which gave the following action particulars:

    17 The applicant’s affidavit continued: 
     
      
       
        
        5. On or about 22 September 1999 I opened up an account in US dollars account number 8114-102941-450 into which the $US34,875.00 was deposited. Annexed hereto and marked with the letter “C” is a copy of my bank account records for the period 22 February 1999 to 13 July 1999. 
        
       
       
      (Annexure C consisted of a series of monthly statements issued by the Arab Bank in relation to account number 8114-102941-450, starting from 22 February 1999, with an opening balance of US$34,875.00, and continuing through to 13 July 1999.) 
       
       
        
        6. On 13 July 1999 account number 8114-102941-450 was closed and the whole of my account balance was transferred to a US dollars statement account number 8114-102941-451. On or about 17 February 2000 I closed the US dollars statement account 8114-102941-451 and transferred the balance of the funds into an Australian dollar cash management account number 8114-102941-600 referred to in paragraph 3 herein. Annexed hereto and marked with the letter “D” is a copy of account statements for account number 8114-102941-451 for the period 13 July 1999 to 17 February 2000. 
        
       
       
      (Annexure D consisted of a series of monthly statements issued by the Arab Bank in relation to account number 8114-102941-451 from 13 July 1999, with an opening balance of US$35,065.71 from closed account number 8114-102941-450, and continuing through to 17 February 2000.) 
       
       
        
        7. On or about 24 April 2001 I received a further sum of $75,685.00 (Australian dollars) from my brother  
        [A B] 
        . These monies were sent through my sister  
        [S B] 
         on his behalf. Annexed hereto and marked with the letter “E” is a copy of a transaction report from the Arab Bank confirming the payment of those monies to my Arab Bank account. 
        
       
      
    18 Annexure E to the applicant’s affidavit was a record of a SWIFT bank-to-bank transfer which gave the following action particulars:

    19 The applicant’s affidavit also stated that further, smaller sums of money deposited in Arab Bank account 8114-102941-600 came from a cheque drawn on the applicant’s ANZ Bank account number 012-878 2597-28025 ($12,112.62), and money won through gambling ($4,500 and $7.15). Annexure F to the affidavit consisted of the monthly ANZ Bank statements from 1 December 200 to 2 August 2001. A cheque withdrawal for the amount stated was shown. A corresponding deposit of the total amount ($16,619.77) can be seen in the May statement for the Arab Bank account 8114-102941-600 found in Annexure A. 
     
      
    20 Leave was given to the applicant to amend the notice of motion so as to claim separately in relation to each deposit made into the fund ultimately constituted by the bank account at the Arab Bank. In view of the provisions of s 9 of the Act, to which I have referred, the amendment does not allow the bank account to be treated in such a segmented way. 
     
      
    21 The applicant stated that he could not afford to pay his legal representatives without the restrained funds. Mr Whitby, his solicitor, stated that the sum of $7,000 per day would be needed to have a solicitor, and junior and senior counsel at the committal hearing, which he expected to last a week, bringing the total cost to $35,000 for a five day hearing. The grand total sum for the committal hearing plus a trial of thirty days’ duration would be $245,000. 
     
      
    22 The evidence led on behalf of the Commission fell, broadly speaking, into two categories. First, there were two discrete episodes which I will refer to as the Sergeant and the Gilchrist episodes. Secondly, there was other evidence which I can broadly describe as contextual. It was submitted on behalf of the Commission that the court would be satisfied on the totality of the evidence that an illicit drug dealing enterprise was carried on at the house for a time immediately prior to the applicant’s arrest, being an enterprise in which the applicant was personally involved and which, on the probabilities – whether the applicant was personally involved in the enterprise or not – was the source of the money in the two bank accounts. 
     
      
       
      The Sergeant episode 
       
      
    23 The evidence led by the Commission relating to this episode was as follows. Detective Fleming annexed a statement to his affidavit which he said was true. In that statement, he said that at 2 pm on 7 June 2001, during a surveillance operation, he observed a silver VT Commodore sedan driven by Olivia Sergeant arrive outside the house. The applicant’s nephew, W H, left the house and approached the car, had a brief conversation with Ms Sergeant, and then appeared to hand her something. Ms Sergeant then drove off. Senior Constable Fleming stated that he then informed surveillance police of this and of the direction of travel of Ms Sergeant’s vehicle. At 2.05 pm, he was informed that Senior Constables Kelly and Codey had stopped Ms Sergeant and conveyed her to Port Kembla Police Station where she was interviewed and issued with a drug diversion notice. Later, on 14 June 2001, he received an analyst’s certificate relating to the drug seized from Ms Sergeant showing that the drug was 0.41 g cocaine of 24.5 per cent purity, the diluent being glucose.  
     
      
    24 Transcripts of eight intercepted telephone conversations between the applicant and Ms Sergeant on 7 June 2001 were tendered and became Exhibit 10. 
     
      
    25 Senior Constable Kelly annexed a statement to his affidavit which he said was true. In that statement, he said that, as a result of a radio message from Detective Fleming at 2 pm on 7 June 2001, he and a Senior Constable Codey went to Gladstone Avenue, Coniston, where they saw a silver VT Commodore driven by Olivia Sergeant. The vehicle was travelling at high speed. Senior Constables Kelly and Codey pursued it but were not able to stop the Commodore until Shellharbour Road, Warrawong. They informed Ms Sergeant that she had been stopped for speeding and, after making inquiries on the police radio, informed her that she would be searched. Senior Constable Codey searched her and found $702 in cash and a small, clear plastic pouch containing an off-white powder. Senior Constable Kelly then arrested Ms Sergeant and he and Codey took her to the Port Kembla Police Station. They interviewed Ms Sergeant. In the course of the interview, she admitted that the pouch contained cocaine but refused to say where she had obtained it. She informed them she had asked for 1 g but did not know what weight she had been given; she had paid $200 for it. (As indicated above, there was other evidence that the substance found on Ms Sergeant was cocaine.) 
     
      
    26 The applicant’s evidence in relation to that episode was as follows. He said that Olivia Sergeant was someone he had known for a long time. He knew she was a heavy cocaine user and he had tried to get her to stop. On 7 June 2001, she came to the house and he supplied her with a substance he referred to as “midnight blue” in powder form. He stated that “midnight blue” was not an illegal substance, but “stuff you take to make you feel relaxed after taking drugs”. 
     
      
    27 The intercepted telephone conversations of which tapes and transcripts were in evidence included conversations on 7 June 2001 between Ms Sergeant and a male person. Detective Fleming deposed that he had spoken to the applicant numerous times prior to obtaining the intercept warrants, both in person and by phone to one of the numbers later intercepted. His affidavit continues: 
     
      
       
        
        During the course of interception of the mentioned telephone services I reviewed call summaries and listened to a large number of recorded conversations. During the vast majority of the calls I identified the voice of  
        [O B] 
        , the defendant as being the person speaking on the mobile service. During calls that I personally reviewed the defendant  
        [B] 
         used his first name of  
        [O] 
         when asked by the caller identify himself. The defendant also on some occasions was referred to by the caller or referred to himself as  
        [O B]. 
         Also during a number of intercepted calls the defendant gave his address to callers as  
        [street address] 
        , Mount St Thomas. 
        
       
       
      The mobile phones used for the relevant telephone conversations were found at the house during police searches on 16 and 24 August 2001. I do not doubt that the person Ms Sergeant spoke with in the telephone conversations intercepted on 7 June 2001 was the applicant. 
       
      
    28 Of these conversations, a number of them occurred prior to Ms Sergeant’s arrival at the house that day. Cocaine was not mentioned. But Ms Sergeant was eager and persistent, phoning several times to see if she could come and pick up what she wanted. The applicant said he would have to get it in. There was a delay. Finally, the applicant said that he had what she wanted.  
     
      
    29 In a conversation after her apprehension, Ms Sergeant told the applicant that she had swallowed the substance he had given her in order to conceal it from the police. She said she was now feeling unwell. The applicant told her she would have to “shit it out”. 
     
      
    30 In cross-examination, the applicant did not admit but did not deny that the relevant voice on the tape recordings of the telephone conversations was his. He denied that he had given Ms Sergeant cocaine, and said that the conversations related to the “midnight blue”. He said that when he told her she had to “shit it out”, he was referring to the plastic bag which the “midnight blue” had been in. 
     
      
    31 The applicant’s account of the episode was implausible. A supply of “midnight blue” was inconsistent with the tenor of conversations with Ms Sergeant before her visit. In the recorded conversation after her apprehension, the applicant then took at face value Ms Sergeant’s account of having swallowed the substance in order conceal it from the police. But that made no sense if the substance was not an illicit drug. On the other hand, the conversation was consistent with her having obtained from him the cocaine found on her by the police. True it is that she had not swallowed the cocaine, but it is quite plausible that she told the appellant she had done so in order to retain his good will and her source of supply. 
     
      
    32 The terminology used in the conversations was vague but both parties obviously knew what they were talking about. The tenor of the conversations with Ms Sergeant indicated that there had been earlier similar transactions. 
     
      
    33 The evidence in relation to this episode strongly suggested that there was an established relationship of illicit drug supplier and customer between the applicant and Ms Sergeant at the time of the episode and that this was an instance of such supply. 
     
      
      The Gilchrist episode 
       
      
    34 The evidence led by the Commission relating to this episode was as follows. Detective Fleming annexed a statement to his affidavit which he said was true. In that statement, he said that, shortly after arranging for interception of the applicant’s mobile phone on 16 March 2001, he became aware that there was an operation in progress at Tumut Police Station under the direction of a Detective Senior Constable Jason Hyatt in relation to suspect James Frederick Gilchrist. Mr Gilchrist was allegedly travelling to the Wollongong area to purchase drugs. At 12.40 pm on 7 June 2001, Detective Fleming, with Detective Sergeant Harbin, saw a silver Commodore Club Sport driven by Mr Gilchrist arrive at the house. Mr Gilchrist entered the house. Detective Fleming and Detective Harbin then had a radio conversation with Hyatt. About ten minutes later, a Danny Ayoub arrived at the house in another car. He too entered the house and just before 1 pm, he and Mr Gilchrist left the house in Mr Ayoub’s car. Just after 1.20 pm, they returned, Mr Gilchrist left the vehicle and entered the house again. He then left again in his own car at 1.54 pm, travelling west. At 6.30 that evening, Detective Hyatt telephoned Detective Fleming to inform him that the vehicle driven by Mr Gilchrist had been stopped by police near Yass, and a Tammy Lee Williamson, a juvenile, had been found in possession of 100 orange tablets which the police believed to be ecstasy. At 7.30 that same evening, Detective Fleming was contacted by the police telephone intercept unit and was played a call between Mr Gilchrist and the applicant recorded at 7.13 pm. He later had this call transcribed, along with two earlier calls between Mr Gilchrist and the applicant prior to 12.40 pm. The transcripts were tendered in court and became Exhibit 11. The 7.13 pm call contains the following exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        V1  
        [Applicant]: 
         Does she  
        [ie 
          
        Tammy Lee Williamson] 
         know where I am? 
        
       
       
        
        V2  
        [Gilchrist]: 
         No, no-one does. No. 
        
       
       
        
        V1: That’s good mate. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: No, I, I you’re all covered a hundred per cent… 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah, and they shouldn’t know my name… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Yeah well make sure no one (unintelligible) you are. 
        
       
       
        
        V2: Yeah, no, no, no. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        V2: No one knows, no one knows anything about… 
        
       
       
        
        V1: Oh, okay that’s good man. 
        
       
       
      Detective Fleming identified the voice of the appellant on these tapes on substantially the same basis as he identified the appellant’s voice in the Sergeant tapes. 
       
      
    35 Constable Marcus Ryan O’Sullivan annexed a statement to his affidavit which he said was true. In that statement, he said that, at 5.30 pm on 7 June 2001, he stopped a VT Commodore driven by an Anthony Belt, in which Tammy Lee Williamson and James Gilchrist were passengers, for a random breath test. After making enquiries on police radio, he prevented Mr Gilchrist from leaving the scene (ostensibly to go to the toilet); then, after another police radio conversation, he asked all the occupants to leave the car and move to the side of the road. Senior Constable Smith then arrived and Constable O’Sullivan questioned Mr Gilchrist, then searched the car for drugs. He found $2,000 in $50 notes in the middle console. Then Detective Senior Constable Chaplin and Senior Constable Kennedy arrived, and Detective Chaplin helped Constable O’Sullivan search the car. Constable O’Sullivan then searched Mr Gilchrist. Nothing was found. He drove Mr Gilchrist to Yass Police Station. At 8.45 pm he returned the money to Mr Belt.  Then he drove Ms Williamson and exhibit number C564658 hundred (presumably, the orange tablets) to Goulburn Police Station. Ms Williamson was placed in custody and Constable Smith handed Sergeant Gray exhibit number C564658 in drug bag B112859 to be placed in the drug safe. 
     
      
    36 Tammy Lee Williamson annexed a statement to her affidavit which she said was true. In that statement, she said that she lived in Tumut and had known Mr Gilchrist, or “Fuchsey”, for three years and had been “scoring drugs off him” throughout that time. At first it was marijuana, but from about February 2001, she started “scoring goey” from him. (I take “goey” to be another illicit drug.) About 7.30 am on 7 June 2001, she and Mr Gilchrist left Tumut by car for Wollongong with Anthony Belt to get some drugs. On the way home, Mr Gilchrist was in the back seat separating the tablets into two plastic bags, when they were pulled over by the police at Yass for a random breath test. Mr Belt put the tablets down his pants but Mr Gilchrist told him to give it to her instead. Mr Belt gave her the tablets and Mr Gilchrist told her to “Put them up ya”. She tried to put them in her vagina but they would not fit. She put them in her underpants. She was searched and the tablets were found. At Yass Police Station she was charged with possession of the tablets. 
     
      
    37 The applicant’s evidence in relation to that episode was as follows. He said that he had known Mr Gilchrist for several years, and that Mr Gilchrist was the uncle of his son. Mr Gilchrist came to the house on 7 June 2001 and went with Mr Ayoub to see about a jet ski. Later they returned and, some time after that, Mr Gilchrist left. The applicant had no memory of Mr Gilchrist calling him after being stopped by police. He agreed that the audio tapes played to the court could have been conversations between him and Mr Gilchrist, but he was not sure, as he had never heard his voice played back to him. The applicant denied that the recording of the telephone call made at 7.13 pm on 7 June 2001 was a conversation between himself and Mr Gilchrist. 
     
      
    38 I do not doubt that the recorded telephone conversations relating to this episode were between the applicant Mr Gilchrist. 
     
      
    39 The evidence in relation to this episode strongly suggested that there was an established relationship of illicit drug supplier and customer between the applicant and Mr Gilchrist and that this was an instance of such supply. 
     
      
       
      Contextual evidence 
       
      
    40 Evidence adduced by the Commission at the hearing shows that the applicant has resided in Australia since July 1987. Before his arrest, he resided in a Department of Housing unit in Church Street, Wollongong, being the third Department of Housing unit he has lived in. He received social security benefits on and off for some years until December 2000. He worked part-time in a furniture and electrical business owned by his brother, receiving about $116 per week. 41 Apart from the applicant’s mother (the registered proprietor of the house) and the applicant’s brother who owns the furniture and electrical business mentioned above, another brother and two sisters also reside in Australia. Another brother, [A B] (the person whom the applicant alleged sent him the money which was found in his Arab Bank account), lives in Syria. Notwithstanding these relationships, under wills made in 1997 by the applicant’s mother and late father, the applicant was named as executor and sole beneficiary. Mr Temby QC for the Commission submitted that this demonstrated the primacy of the applicant within the family after his father's death and would account for money from an illicit drug dealing enterprise, carried on at the house, being in the applicant's bank account even if he was not directly involved in the enterprise. 
     
      
    42 Detective Fleming gave oral evidence by leave about the nature of the telephone traffic to and from the mobile phones found in the house. He said that he had listened to in excess of 8,000 telephone calls over a period of about five months, and that about 90 to 95 per cent of them were incoming calls. Mr Temby QC for the Commission submitted that this indicated that a substantial business enterprise was being carried on at the house involving the supply of a commodity which, with other evidence, should be found to have been illicit drugs.  
     
      
    43 On 16 August 2001, the date of the applicant’s arrest and again on 24 August 2001, the house was searched by the police and items of property were seized. The property seized by the police included the following:

    44 Detective Fleming, in cross-examination, revealed that some of the documents found in the briefcases had been tested for fingerprints, and had been found to have the applicant’s fingerprints on them, but he did not specify the documents to which he was referring. 
     
      
    45 The following items of seized property were tendered by the Commission at the hearing and became exhibits:

         Two page American Express AMP statement 
          
           
           9 
           
         
         
         A copy of one of the videotapes found in the black briefcase 
          
           
           7 
           
         
        
       
      
    46 The applicant denied knowing that sensitive electronic scales were found at the house. He admitted knowing of the mobile phones and guns. He said that he only became aware of the presence of the Sudafed and Cold and Flu tablets after being told by the police. He said he only became aware that they could be used in the manufacture of prohibited drugs after the police told him so. 
     
      
    47 The videotape which became Exhibit 7 was played to the Court. This was one of the tapes found in the briefcase during the police search of the house. There were several distinct segments, separated by periods of blank tape. Two segments showed a press. To my ear, the voice in one of the segments was the applicant's voice or very similar to it. The speech recorded on the tape indicated that the speaker intended to use the press for making tablets from some substance in powder form. The applicant denied having seen the machine before, denied knowing what it was for, and denied that the voice on the tape was his. No innocent explanation was offered for the press being depicted on the videotape. 48 Another segment of the video tape showed a room with a bed. On the bed was a large quantity of money in various denominations of Australian banknotes, I would estimate something in excess of $100,000. The next segment showed apparently the same room and bed, without the money. The applicant identified the room and bed as “looking like” a bed and bedroom at the house. In his closing address, Mr Steirn SC for the applicant accepted – very properly – that, on the balance of probabilities, the money was on a bed in the house. 
     
      
    49 The final segment from the video tape was of a group of young people. A girl’s voice could be heard saying “Hey, [O]!” The applicant identified some of the people as his friends. He said he was there at that time. He said he could not remember operating the video camera but he might have done. This was further evidence linking the applicant with the videotape found in the briefcase at the house. 
     
      
    50 As regards the other exhibits, the applicant’s evidence was as follows: 
     
     He said he did not know where Exhibit 12 (the piece of paper with numbers and the word “meth” written on it several times) came from, that the handwriting on it was not his. 
     He said someone had given him Exhibit 8 (the document headed “E-Z Test” which apparently described a commercially available test kit for the drug ecstasy). 
     He said he had never seen Exhibit 13 (the invoice from the Test Tube Factory in the applicant’s name) before. 
     He said he had never seen Exhibit 14 (the piece of paper with handwriting on both sides headed “MDA pg1485 Tenamfetamine”) before. 
     He said he had never seen Exhibit 15 (the photocopy document titled “MARTINDALE The Extra Pharmacopoeia”, relating to pseudoephedrine) before. 
     He denied having seen Exhibit 16 (the internet download titled “Making LSD in your own kitchen”) before, and further denied knowing what “LSD” was. 
     He denied having seen Exhibit 17 (the internet download titled “Manufacture of Ecstasy”) before, although he admitted having used ecstasy. 
     He did not specifically deny having seen Exhibit 18 (the copy document titled “Methamphetamines - a growing epidemic?”), but he said that the briefcases found during the police searches only contained “family documents”. I take this to imply that he had not seen the document before. He admitted having used methamphetamine. 
       
    51 Towards the end of the cross-examination of the applicant, Mr Temby QC put the following questions. 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Mr  
        [B] 
         I suggest to you the truth is that you have been buying and selling illegal drugs for the past several years. 
         
        A. Is that what you think? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What do you say to that? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I suggest to you that you had many drug customers of whom Olivia Sergeant and James Gilchrist are only two, what do you say to that? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And I suggest to you that you arranged for moneys which you obtained from your drug dealing to go out of Australia so that they could be sent back to you in Australia. 
         
        A. No I didn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the money on the bed that we saw in the video, it’s yours, isn’t it? 
         
        A. I’ve never seen it before. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Whose is it? 
         
        A. I don’t know. 
        
       
       
      The applicant’s credit 
       
      
    52 This is material for two principal reasons. First, there is the question of what weight the court would give to the applicant’s denial of any illicit drug enterprise being carried on at the house. Secondly, there is the need for the applicant to satisfy the court affirmatively of matters which depend upon his sworn evidence as necessary conditions for the making of an order as sought. 
     
      
    53 As to the applicant’s credit, the Commission made the following submissions. The evidence of the Sergeant episode was consistent with a relationship between the applicant and Ms Sergeant of drug supplier and drug user. Affidavit evidence of police officers Fleming and Kelly showed that, on 7 June 2001, Olivia Sergeant had driven to the house, had been supplied with something by an occupant of the house, was then stopped and searched and was found to possess an amount of cocaine. Her admission that the substance was cocaine, and that she had paid $200 for it, was against interests and thus reliable. Telephone intercept evidence confirmed that she had rung the applicant and agreed to pick something up before arriving at the house, and after being arrested, she had rung the applicant to tell him she had swallowed something rather than have the police find it, and it had made her sick. The applicant’s response was to tell her she had to “shit it out”. The Commission’s submission was the applicant’s suggestion that he was referring to the plastic bag was “silly”, he had clearly supplied her with an illegal substance, and he was therefore lying under oath. This, the Commission submitted, meant that he was a witness of low credibility and the Court should not accept any of his evidence without corroboration. 
     
      
    54 Similarly, the Commission submitted that, in relation to the Gilchrist episode, affidavit evidence of police officers Fleming and Ryan confirm that a car containing Gilchrist, Belt and Williamson was stopped on the Hume Highway near Yass. Gilchrist had earlier been seen at the house. Williamson was found with the ecstasy tablets on her person. Telephone intercept evidence showed that Gilchrist and the applicant had had conversations before Gilchrist had arrived at the house and after the car had been stopped. Gilchrist had told the applicant that no-one knew who the applicant was. The applicant’s only response was to deny that he took part in this conversation. Again, the Commission argues that this shows that he lied under oath and that, therefore, the Court would not accept anything he said without corroboration. 
     
      
    55 In regard to the contextual evidence, the Commission submitted, again, that the applicant had no credibility. The applicant’s fingerprints were found on certain documents which he claimed never to have seen. The Commission again argued that this showed he lied under oath, and his evidence was not to be believed without corroboration. 
     
      
    56 I have no confidence in the applicant’s credibility.  
     
      
       
      Primary finding 
       
      
    57 There is the issue as to whether an illicit drug dealing enterprise in which the applicant was involved was being carried out at the Ocean St house for some time prior to the applicant’s arrest. 
     
      
    58 Evidence adduced by the Commissioner strongly suggests that there was. The applicant admits that there is a strong Crown case. 
     
      
    59 This matter, although involving evidence of criminal activity, is a civil action brought in the Common Law Division of this Court, according to the terms of s 5 of the Act. As Dixon J made clear in Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336, except in criminal matters, it is enough if an allegation is proved to the “reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal” (at 362). He then went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        This does not mean that some standard of persuasion is fixed intermediate between the satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt required upon a criminal inquest and the reasonable satisfaction which in a civil issue may, not must, be based on a preponderance of probability. It means that the nature of the issue necessarily affects the process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained. 
        
       
      
    60 Notwithstanding that principle, the evidence of the Sergeant episode and of the Gilchrist episode and of the contextual matters to which I have referred leaves me in no doubt that an illicit drug dealing enterprise, involving the applicant, was carried on at the house. I find that this was so and that the applicant’s denial of that on oath was knowingly false. 
     
      
    61 On the evidence, the enterprise carried on at the house was likely to have been highly remunerative. The applicant had no other means of accumulating a large sum of money. Absent explanation, I would infer that the money in the bank account came from the illicit drug dealing enterprise in which the applicant was involved. The fact that a substantial part of the funds in the bank account was sent from overseas is not inconsistent with that, since money could have been taken out of Australia in cash by the applicant, by relatives or by associates on one or more of their trips to the Middle East and returned to Australia under the guise of a legitimate transaction. 62 The applicant’s case is that the transfers from Lebanon were pursuant to a legitimate transaction, namely, a loan by the applicant’s brother of moneys from the brother’s his own resources. There was no explanation as to why the transfers were made through intermediaries in that event. 
     
      
    63 More importantly, there was no evidence from the applicant’s brother or the intermediaries that the money sent to Australia was from him, and from his own resources. The only explanation offered for the absence of such evidence was cost. That is not a satisfactory explanation for the absence of a short affidavit, albeit from overseas, in the context of the other legal work carried out on behalf of the applicant in the present proceedings. 
     
      
    64 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that it was for the Commission to adduce evidence that the money did not come from the applicant’s brother; or, at least, that it was as much for the Commission to adduce evidence on this topic as it was for the applicant. True it is that the burden of proof of an illicit source is on the Commission, but, there has been a shift of the evidentiary burden of proof in view of the evidence to which I have referred. It was for the applicant to dispel the implication which otherwise arose from the evidence that the moneys in the bank account came from an illicit drug dealing enterprise in which the applicant was involved. 
     
      
    65 Burden of proof aside, the persons involved in the transmission of the funds were “in the applicant's camp” per Hunt CJ at CL in Sandford (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 185. If they were to be called at all, it was the applicant who could reasonably be expected to call them. On the applicant's account of events, one of those persons was his brother and the others were persons known to him and / or his brother.  
     
      
    66 By contrast, it was not shown that it would have been practicable for the Commission to investigate the source of the funds. There was nothing to suggest that the transmitting bank would have revealed the whereabouts of the parties who deposited the funds in Lebanon and who ordered the transfers, nor that the Commission could, by servants or agents, have readily located and interviewed the intermediaries in Lebanon and the applicant’s brother in Syria. It was not to be expected that the Commission would be in a position to adduce direct evidence that the money was taken overseas and returned under the guise of a legitimate transaction if that were the fact. 
     
      
    67 The principle in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 runs against the applicant rather than the Commission in the circumstances. The absence of evidence authenticating the applicant’s explanation for having such a large sum of money in his bank account enables the court to give greater weight to the inference that the true source of the money was the illicit drug dealing enterprise carried on at the house for a time prior to the applicant's arrest. 
     
      
    68 I am persuaded that, substantially, the funds in the applicant’s bank account were the product of an illicit drug dealing operation, and were, accordingly, illegally acquired property within the meaning of s 16A(1)(b) of the Act. An order as sought is accordingly proscribed by the subsection. 
     
      
    69 It is unnecessary in these circumstances to deal with the other ways in which the Commission says that an order in favour of the applicant is proscribed by s 16A(1). 
     
      
    70 For these reasons, the application is refused with costs.

      Judgment – aPPLICATION FOR COSTS 
      
      
       
        
       
     1 BLANCH AJ: On 21 June, 2002 this Court delivered a judgment allowing the appeal against conviction and quashing the convictions and sentences and entering verdicts of acquittal on both counts. The basis of that decision was that the evidence would not have justified a reasonable jury concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of either offence and the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. At the conclusion of the judgment, the appellant applied for a certificate under s2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1967 (NSW). Section 2 provides: 
      
       
        
       The Court or Justice or Justices in any proceedings relating to any offence whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may - 
        
        
       (a) where the defendant after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted or discharged as to the information then under inquiry; or 
        
        
       (b) where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and 
        
        
         
         (i) the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted; 
          
         
        
       or 
        
        
         
         (ii) the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed; 
         
        
        
       grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in s3 and relating to those proceedings. 
        
       
     2 Section 3(1) of the Act goes on to provide: 
      
       
        
       A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Justice or Justices granting the certificate - 
        
        
       (a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and 
        
        
       (b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances. 
        
       
     3 In R v Manley (2000) 49 NSWLR 203 at 205 Wood CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
         
         ”The requirement for proof, by the applicant, of unreasonableness for institution of the proceedings within the meaning of s3(1)(a) was the subject of consideration by Blanch J, in  
         McFarlane 
          Supreme Court of New South Wales, 12 August 1994 unreported, a case in which the accused was found not guilty, and discharged, at the close of the Crown case. 
         
        
        
         
         In an observation of immediate relevance for the present appeal, with which I would respectfully agree, his Honour said concerning a case that turned upon evidence of a highly technical nature: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘If a highly qualified expert in a medical field gives an opinion, such opinion would normally have to be accepted by a tribunal of fact unless there were other aspects of the case which would cause the opinion to be questioned. … If the hypothetical prosecutor instituting proceedings knew there were equally qualified experts who gave conflicting evidence in a case where that opinion was conclusive as to whether the prosecution should succeed, it seems to be questionable whether it would be reasonable to proceed with the prosecution.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Otherwise his Honour said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘None of the reported cases addresses the question of what ‘reasonable’ means in the context of the decision to institute proceedings. Clearly a decision to institute proceedings is not based upon the test that prosecution agencies throughout Australia use as the discretionary test for continuing to prosecute, namely whether there is any reasonable prospect of conviction. Equally the decision is not governed by the test in s41(6) of the  
           Justices Act 
            applied by magistrates, namely whether no reasonable jury would be likely to convict. Equally the test cannot be a test of reasonable suspicion which might justify an arrest and it cannot be the test which determines whether the prosecution is malicious. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           In the ordinary course of events a prosecution may be launched where there is evidence to establish a prima facie case but that does not mean it is reasonable to launch a prosecution simply because a prima facie case exists. There may be cases where there is contradictory evidence and where it is reasonable to expect a prosecutor to make some evaluation of that evidence.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         These observations have been cited with approval by this Court in  
         Fejsa 
          (1995) 82 A Crim R 253 and  
         Pavy 
          CCA (NSW) 9 December 1997 unreported, in the former of which the Court observed, as did the Court of Appeal in  
         NSW Treasurer v Wade 
          CA(NSW) 16 June 1994 unreported, that is would be unwise to attempt to lay down any all-embracing definition of the circumstances in which it would be unreasonable to institute proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         Given the wide variety of cases that might arise for consideration, I am similarly reluctant to attempt any exhaustive definition of the test. It seems to me that the section calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence, and particularly the extent to which there is any contradiction of expert evidence concerning central facts necessary to establish guilt, or inherent weakness in the prosecution case. Matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder, whether it be Judge or Jury. 
         
        
        
         
         Fejsa 
          at 257 and  
         Pavy 
          at 5, each make it clear that the mere fact that this Court allows an appeal and enters a verdict of acquittal, upon the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground, as it was then comprehensively described, is  
         not 
          necessarily a touchstone for an exercise of the discretion in favour of the applicant. I agree with the observations to that effect, in those decisions. I also agree with Simpson J, that the onus falls upon the applicant to show that it was not reasonable to institute the proceedings.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     4 Part of what his Honour says adopts what I said in McFarlane (supra). The remainder of what his Honour says I would in my turn with respect adopt. 
      
       
     5 The question of the reasonableness of the decision to prosecute in this case is not really clouded by any further evidence which emerged at the trial. The evidence to support this prosecution came from three pieces of evidence in the nature of identification evidence. The first was the evidence of Mr. Brown when he looked at the photographs and pointing at the photograph of the appellant said “That looks more like him.” The second witness was Ms. Pandelis who identified two photographs which could have been of the robber but only one photograph was that of the appellant. The third piece of evidence was the video footage which showed the image of a face not inconsistent with that of the appellant, but not enough to identify him as the robber. The fact there were three pieces of evidence of this nature did not strengthen the prosecution case. The evidence of 30 witnesses identifying the appellant as someone who might have been the robber is no more cogent than the evidence of one witness who gave such evidence. It is inherent in the nature of such evidence that the appellant might not be the robber. 
      
       
     6 In addition to that evidence, the only evidence produced was a sweatshirt and cap found at the home of the appellant’s mother about which there was an alternative explanation, even if it could have been identified as the clothing worn by the robber. The last piece of evidence which could have been relied upon is the evidence of the discovery of three bottles of after shave at the home of the appellant, two of which were of the same type as taken from the car used in the robbery.7 The clothing and the after shave were pieces of circumstantial evidence but clearly they did not exclude any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the appellant. All of these factors were known when the prosecution was commenced and it was not reasonable in my view to institute the proceedings. Accordingly, I would grant to the appellant a certificate under s2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1967.

      Judgment 
     1 BLANCH AJ: These are three appeals against sentences imposed at Parramatta District Court on 17 July, 2001. The applicant, Jamie Paul Alvarez, is appealing against an effective sentence of ten years, with a non-parole period of six and a half years from 26 December, 1999. Those sentences were passed in respect of a charge of assault with intent to rob being armed on 3 August, 1995, contrary to s97 Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of twenty years and a second charge of assault with intent to rob being armed under the same section on 12 April, 1996. On the first offence, he was sentenced to a fixed term of three years and on the second offence, taking two matters into account on a Form 1, to seven years with a non-parole period of three and a half years to date from the end of the first sentence.2 Phillip Steven Alvarez is appealing against an effective sentence of twenty years from 20 June, 1999 with an effective non-parole period of fifteen years. These sentences were made up as follows: 
      
       
     1. Armed robbery on 19 February, 1997, taking into account 31 matters on a Form 1 – fixed term of four years from 20 June, 1999;2. Aggravated robbery being armed on 18 March, 1998 – fixed term of four years from 20 June, 2003;3. Carried in a conveyance without consent – fixed term of twelve months from 20 June, 2003;4. Conspiracy to commit armed robbery between 1 May, 1998 and 18 June, 1998 – fixed term of three years from 20 June, 2007;5. Maliciously shoot at with intent to prevent lawful apprehension on 17 June, 1998 – fixed term four years from 20 June, 2007;6. Drive conveyance without consent on 17 June, 1998 – fixed term twelve months from 20 June, 2007;7. Armed robbery on 18 August, 1998 – head sentence eight years from 20 June, 2011, non-parole period of three years to expire 19 June, 2014;8. Drive conveyance without consent on 17 June, 1998 – fixed term twelve months from 20 June, 2011. 
      
       
     3 John Anthony McCulloch – On the same day he was sentenced to an effective sentence of sixteen years, with a non-parole period of twelve years. He was sentenced as follows:1. On a charge of armed robbery on 19 February, 1997, he was sentenced to a fixed term of six years from 18 February, 1999, taking into account seventeen matters on a Form 1 consisting largely of robbery related offences and car stealing related offences;2. Conspiracy to commit armed robbery between 1 May, 1998 and 18 June, 1998 – fixed term of four years to commence 18 February, 2005;3. Maliciously shoot at with intent to prevent lawful apprehension – ten years from 18 February, 2005 with a non-parole period of six years to expire on 17 February, 2011;4. Carried in conveyance without consent on 17 June, 1998 – twelve months fixed term from 18 February, 2005.4 There were six main events which were the subject matter of the sentences and they were as follows:1. On 18 March, 1998 Phillip Alvarez and another man forced their way into the Commonwealth Bank at Warrawong at 9.30 a.m. Each of the men was carrying a handgun and Phillip Alvarez had a Walther P38 which was loaded. They jumped over the counter brandishing the handguns and ordered the tellers to give them money. They obtained $30,000. During the robbery the doors of the bank had been locked and Phillip Alvarez demanded they be opened. A bank employee did that and as he was leaving, Alvarez discharged his gun, the projectile striking a pane of glass alongside the front door and a piece of the glass cut the arm of the nearby bank employee. The offenders escaped in a stolen van. There were a large number of members of the public present at the bank on the day because it was pension day.2. There was a conspiracy between Phillip Alvarez and John McCulloch to commit an armed robbery on the Commonwealth Bank at Condell Park in June, 1998. The plan was to commit this robbery on pension day and to take the money from the security van which was delivering the money to the bank that day before it got into the bank. Two weeks before 17 June, their plan was thwarted by the vigilance of security guards, but they arranged to try again on 17 June using a stolen car, disguises and loaded firearms. On 17 June, 1998 Phillip Alvarez and McCulloch again went to the vicinity of the Commonwealth Bank at Condell Park but Constable Pedersen pulled up their vehicle because one of the males was not wearing a seat belt. Alvarez gave a false name and could not produce a drivers’ licence. The police officer went back to his vehicle to make a check and it was realised he would discover the vehicle the offenders were in was stolen. Alvarez and McCulloch got out of the car and approached the police vehicle. McCulloch was carrying a loaded handgun. Constable Pedersen saw McCulloch and that he was carrying a gun. McCulloch raised the gun and pointed it at Constable Pedersen who jumped out of his vehicle and ran across the nature strip. He heard a gunshot from behind him. He turned and pointed his own gun at the two men. He saw McCulloch turn and fire the gun in his direction. Alvarez got in the car to drive away and McCulloch fired a further shot before he got into the car which sped off. The sentencing judge accepted from the jury’s verdict that just before they approached the police car, Phillip Alvarez had said to McCulloch that he was going to have to shoot the police officer because otherwise they would be identified by him.3. On 18 August, 1998 Phillip Alvarez stole a motor car and with some friends went to a home in Katoomba Avenue, San Remo, occupied by Tiffany Gardiner and Barry Jones. It was expected they would find a large quantity of drugs, jewellery and money there. Three offenders forced entry into the premises and threatened the occupants with pistols. Phillip Alvarez threatened Jones and hit him over the head with a pistol. There was further terrorising of both the victims and the house was ransacked. A small amount of cash was stolen and the offenders left. Jones ran outside after them and Phillip Alvarez fired three shots at Jones.4. On 19 February, 1997 the Commonwealth Bank at Warrawong was robbed by Phillip Alvarez and John McCulloch. The two offenders with another man travelled from Sydney to the Port Kembla area and using a stolen car, they drove to the bank. They had parked near a white van which was stolen and it was to be used in their escape. Alvarez and McCulloch changed into dark clothing and loaded two handguns, put on gloves and entered the bank. Alvarez was carrying a loaded Walther P38 handgun and McCulloch was carrying a loaded revolver. They jumped over the counter and ordered staff and customers to the floor. They moved from teller to teller demanding money, threatening the staff. They obtained $104,150 and ran from the bank. They drove off in one stolen vehicle and they changed into another stolen vehicle to escape. Again it was pension day and there were many customers at the bank.5. Phillip Alvarez, McCulloch and Jamie Alvarez were all involved in an attempt to rob the Bleakely Fine Chemicals factory at Silverwater on 3 August, 1995. Just before 7.00 p.m. all three entered the premises armed with handguns and in balaclavas and wearing gloves. The only person on the premises was the cleaner who was about to leave. She was threatened in order to obtain information about the whereabouts of chemicals. The offenders expected to find there a large quantity of pseudoephedrine which they anticipated they could sell for $180,000. The drug, however, had been moved. The sentencing judge accepted that Jamie Alvarez’s part in this robbery was only as an assistant to his brother and that he took no real part in the planning.6. On 12 April, 1996 Phillip Alvarez and Jamie Alvarez were involved in a robbery at the Commonwealth Bank at Punchbowl. They loaded two handguns and prepared disguises and went in the car driven by the mother of another offender in a stolen car to near the bank. They watched a Brambles truck deliver $710,000 to the bank. The Alvarez brothers entered the bank and Jamie Alvarez jumped over the counter. Anti-bandit screens were activated but Jamie Alvarez ran to the bank manager and shouted to him to get the money out and opened the door to allow his brother access. The two offenders then forced the manager and assistant manager to go to the strong-room and Jamie Alvarez told the manager the gun he was carrying was real and discharged a shot into the floor. Jamie demanded the money and threatened to kill both the manager and the assistant manager. They were told the vault was on a time delay lock and the manager then set the time delay lock. Jamie threatened that he would kill the manager and moved his hand on the trigger of his gun. The manager and assistant manager moved in opposite directions and Jamie Alvarez discharged the gun, the bullet passing near where the staff had been standing. The offenders did not wait for the time delay lock and fled from the bank. Nothing was taken.5 Phillip Alvarez and McCulloch were jointly tried on a number of these offences in a trial which lasted from 23 January to 5 March, 2001. They were convicted of some of these offences and they have pleaded to others or had them taken into account on a Form 1. Phillip Alvarez went to trial from 16 March in relation to the San Remo offences and was convicted. Jamie Alvarez was convicted following a jury trial of the assault with intent to rob at the Silverwater chemicals factory. He pleaded guilty to the Punchbowl bank robbery and had one other robbery taken into account on a Form 1.6 Phillip Alvarez was identified by the sentencing judge as the ring leader in the offences. He was 29 at the time of the offences. He had some prior criminal history. However, there were no offences of violence. In 1994 he was dealt with in the Local Court and given community service in respect of driving offences and illegal use of a vehicle. He was also placed on a bond to be of good behaviour for two years. A number of these offences were committed whilst he was on that bond. On 31 October, 1997 he was given periodic detention for nine months for possessing an unlicensed firearm. That sentence was to commence on 14 November, 1997. In March, 1998 he was involved in the second bank robbery at Warrawong. No reports were tendered as to his background but it is apparent from the pre-sentence report tendered in the case of Jamie Alvarez that their father and mother separated and in 1982 their father committed suicide while overseas on a business trip. Their mother gravitated towards partners who shared with her in alcohol abuse and these two boys escaped their home by living in youth refuges. The pre-sentence report says “The legacy of those years is the devotion and loyalty the Alvarez siblings have toward one another.” A number of references were tendered on his behalf. A family priest indicated he regarded these offences as totally out of character to the person he knew. The Official Visitor from the gaol indicated both brothers had seen the error of their ways and belonged to a close-knit family. Other references for the applicant, Jamie Alvarez, attested to the same matters. One of his referees describes him as a hard worker and he has been offered work on his release from prison.7 In the case of McCulloch, no material was tendered before the sentencing judge. He is considerably older than the co-offenders, being now 52 years of age. He has a significant criminal history. He was sentenced in 1972 to fifteen years with an eight year non-parole period (reduced on appeal to six years) for armed robberies and in 1979 he was sentenced to twelve years with a nine year non-parole period for armed robberies and other offences. In 1994 he was placed on a three year bond for take and drive a conveyance and he has committed offences in breach of that bond.8 Jamie Alvarez is now 28 years of age, although in 1995 when the first of his offences was committed, he was 21. He has a minor criminal history dating back to 1994. He was given a two year bond for possessing implements to enter a conveyance and possessing a prohibited drug on 15 January, 1996, which was only three months before the offence on 16 April, 1996 committed against the Commonwealth Bank at Punchbowl. I have referred to the pre-sentence report in his case and it is a matter of some importance in his case to assess the overall criminality, particularly in the context of the fact that both the offences being dealt with on indictment are offences committed with his brother. The pre-sentence report concluded that he “demonstrated a good vocabulary and outlined personal and professional goals that required a focussed, creative and energetic mind.” In his case a report from Duffy, Barrier and Robilliard, psychologists, was tendered. That report expressed the clinical opinion that the tests “described an unstable personality construct that would be evidenced in grandiose and impulsive thinking and behaviour …”. The conclusion was that he “… is still very loosely integrated in his thinking and his behaviour. He did not demonstrate any clear signs of psychosis during our meeting however his thought processes were flighty, tangential and quite illogical at times.” This report also noted the emotional bond between this applicant and his older brother. I note the sentencing judge said he had been assessed by professionals over the years as suffering from various conditions including Attention Deficit Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Schizophrenia and Bipolar manic Disorder. The only basis for that appears to be that the applicant told that to the interviewing psychologist, Ms. Robilliard.9 On behalf of Phillip Alvarez, it is put that he had not previously been sentenced to full-time imprisonment and the submission is made that too little weight was given to the subjective material in his case. It is true there was material which had to be taken into account on behalf of Phillip Alvarez but, of course, that had to be weighed against the objective seriousness of the very significant number of offences for which he was to be sentenced. It is also pointed out that although there was material to indicate the applicant had children with whom he would lose contact once sentenced, the judge did not mention this as one of the difficulties he would experience in custody. On the other hand, it is not incumbent upon a judge to mention every single matter of difficulty involved in being in gaol.10 A further criticism advanced is that the judge found special circumstances but the overall sentence, in fact, reflects the statutory ratio. As to this, the sentencing judge made it clear she found special circumstances only because she was accumulating sentences and there was no error in the way she did this. Finally, it is submitted on this applicant’s behalf that the sentence is manifestly excessive. That submission is made based on the suggestion that the top of the range for head sentences for aggravated armed robbery is twelve years. That submission overlooks the significant number of offences involved in this case and it also overlooks the other criminality, particularly in the charge of maliciously shoot at with intent to prevent lawful apprehension.11 At the end of the day, this applicant was being sentenced for 13 robbery related offences, 13 offences related to stealing cars, a charge of maliciously shoot at with intent to prevent lawful apprehension plus other serious offences. In my view, no criticism can be made of the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge and accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.12 On behalf of the applicant, John McCulloch, the argument advanced is based on parity and it is submitted that Phillip Alvarez was the applicant’s co-offender on all counts in the indictment and that Phillip Alvarez had even more offences. It is pointed out that the sentencing judge accepted that although McCulloch was older, it was Phillip Alvarez who organised the episodes of criminality engaged in by these two offenders. It is noted that this applicant had a significant criminal history for committing armed robberies.13 The question at issue is whether the sentence passed on this applicant when compared to the sentence passed on Phillip Alvarez could give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance – see Postiglione v The Queen (1995-1996) 189 CLR 295 and Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 607. This applicant was being sentenced for four counts on an indictment and 17 counts on a Form 1. The 17 counts on the Form 1 included seven robbery related offences and, of course, it must be remembered that in the very serious incident of shooting at the police officer, it was this applicant who did the shooting.14 On the charge of shoot at with intent to avoid lawful apprehension, this applicant was sentenced to ten years commencing on 17 February, 2015 with a non-parole period of six years. That is contrasted with the fixed term of four years given to Phillip Alvarez for the same offence. It is pointed out that although McCulloch was the one who fired the gun, he was encouraged to do so by Phillip Alvarez and the judge assessed the criminality of Phillip Alvarez as almost the same. On this basis, it is said a justifiable sense of grievance exists. On the other hand, what has to be compared is the four year term with the six year non-parole period. It must also be remembered that the sentences for each of these applicants was part of an overall sentence and affected by considerations of totality and the need to fix an appropriate non-parole period. The same comment can be made in respect of the other sentences. It is not possible to deconstruct and compare the component sentences of these two applicants. What has to be compared is the final sentence, bearing in mind the total criminality of each and recognizing that in a case such as this, parity cannot be measured with mathematical precision. The actual impact on McCulloch is that he is to serve twelve years in gaol before being eligible for release. Phillip Alvarez will serve fifteen years before being eligible for release.15 In my view, bearing in mind the criminal record of this applicant for committing robberies (which includes fourteen years he has actually served in custody for such offences) the number of robberies he was being sentenced for on this occasion and his criminality involved in the charge of maliciously shoot at with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, there is no possible basis on which he could harbour a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing his sentence with that of Phillip Alvarez, who will serve at least three years longer in circumstances where he has never been to gaol before. 16 It is further submitted that although the sentencing judge found special circumstances because the sentences were to be accumulated and because there was a need for additional supervision, there should have been a greater disturbance of the statutory ratio. It is pointed out that the non-parole period which has been fixed does, in fact, reflect the statutory ratio in relation to the total sentence. In my view, the fact the sentencing judge found two bases for disturbing the statutory ratio did not necessitate any greater reduction in the non-parole period. In fact, all the sentencing judge found in this case was “He will also require a period of supervision in the community to ensure his rehabilitation.” No reason was given for this finding and there are no special considerations in this case, apart from the fact that the applicant will be in his mid-sixties when he is eligible for parole and he will be released after having spent a very long time in custody.17 In my view the sentence imposed and the non-parole periods fixed are quite appropriate, bearing in mind the offences for which this applicant was being sentenced and what subjective material was available.18 I would therefore grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.19 On behalf of Jamie Alvarez, it is submitted that the sentence is manifestly excessive. In particular, it is submitted that the sentence ultimately imposed on this applicant is higher than sentences ordinarily imposed for offences at the time these offences were committed. In that regard, this Court was referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129. The Court has been referred to a number of cases where it is said significantly lower sentences than sentences in the order of ten years were imposed for similar sorts of offences in the period from 1992 to 1996. The submission suggests that after the decision of this Court in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 sentences for armed robbery significantly increased. I note that submission is at odds with a submission made by Counsel on behalf of Phillip Alvarez that the Judicial Commission statistics reveal “… the top of the range of head sentences is 12 years and for non-parole periods 9 years for the 65 cases decided before the judgment of R v Henry. For the 79 cases decided after Henry, the top of the range of head sentences is also 12 years and for non-parole periods 8 years.”20 It is important to note that the decision in R v MJR was a decision dealing with sentencing for stale crime. In that case, the period of delay between offence and sentence was 15 to 20 years. I believe it is quite artificial to attempt to construct a different regime of sentencing involving a delay in the order of five years as was relevant in this case. That point might be demonstrated by looking at the guideline decision in R v Henry. At paragraph 165 Spigelman CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion sentences for an offence of the character identified above should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. I have arrived at this figure after drawing on the collective knowledge of the other four members of the Court with respect to sentence ranges. I have also reviewed the sentences which this Court has imposed on occasions when it has intervened, including in Crown appeals where the principle of double jeopardy applies. The proposed range is broadly consistent with this body of prior decisions in this Court.” 
         
        
       
     21 The Chief Justice went on to quote ten cases from 1992 to 1998 which were consistent with that range, 15 cases between 1991 and 1997 which were above that range and seven cases between 1993 and 1998 which were below that range. It is quite clear that the guideline judgment in Henry was, in fact, based upon sentences which had been imposed from 1991 to 1998. Of course, the Chief Justice went on to say at paragraph 167: 
      
       
        
         
         “Aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the range, as this Court’s prior decisions indicate. The narrow range is a starting point.” 
         
        
       
     22 At the end of the day, the decision in R v Henry has very little to do with this case. Neither that guideline judgment nor any other decision of the Court would suggest that a sentence of five years was appropriate for this applicant. The major offence he has been sentenced for is a well-planned attempted armed robbery on a bank with significant violence in the execution of the offence. There are some cases where guidelines and sentencing statistics are of little value and this is one of them. Fortunately, there are not enough crimes with this level of planning and violence to provide meaningful statistics, complicated as this case is by the number of offences and the fact that the attempted robbery at Punchbowl was shortly after the applicant was placed on a bond.23 The further submission is made on this applicant’s behalf that his personality problems and dependence on his older brother were overlooked. As I have pointed out, there was no evidence of a personality disorder in this case other than what the psychologist’s report said and the findings of the psychologist were very limited. It was found he had no signs of psychosis and it was advised that he have “instruction in the behavioural management of stress and development in coping mechanisms…”. It was said that a psychiatric assessment “may also be appropriate.” That was not done. I do not believe any of these matters were overlooked by the sentencing judge.24 The case of this applicant nonetheless calls for anxious consideration. The Silverwater chemicals factory attempted robbery was on 3 August, 1995, the Punchbowl bank robbery was on 16 April, 1996 and there was a robbery at Waterloo on 15 February, 1996. This offence was committed with his brother. They waited for a woman to return to a business with the payroll and together robbed her of $6,669.50 and other personal property. There were no other offences until his arrest on 25 December, 1999.25 There is no doubt this applicant is deserving of greater consideration. However, he pleaded not guilty to the Silverwater chemicals factory attempted robbery and consequently he was not entitled to a discount for a plea. He did plead guilty to the Punchbowl bank attempted robbery and acknowledged his guilt on the third robbery. However, the degree of his criminality in the Punchbowl bank offence was extremely great. After carefully weighing those matters up, I have come to the conclusion that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was within an appropriate sentencing range and accordingly, I would allow the application for leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.26 SMART AJ: I agree with Blanch AJ. *****************

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Sperling J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Downs ADCJ, sitting in the District Court Sydney on 22 February 2002. 
      
       
     2 On 14 January 2002 the applicant had appeared for trial in relation to one count of aggravated robbery in company. However, the indictment presented on that date consisted of one count of robbery in company. The applicant pleaded guilty to that count. He should be taken to have pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity in these circumstances. 
      
       
     3 The maximum penalty for the offence charged is twenty years' imprisonment. 
      
       
     4 The sentence was for four years. His Honour found special circumstances on the basis that there were good prospects for rehabilitation and that the applicant required an extensive period under supervision on parole for this purpose. A non-parole period of two years was fixed. 
      
       
     5 The facts of the offence were shortly as follows. A woman was sitting in a parked vehicle at Surry Hills. She was holding a mobile phone. Two persons, including the applicant, approached the car. The second man - not the applicant - took hold of the woman's hand and wrenched the mobile phone from her. The applicant stood next to the other man while this was done. The two men then fled. 
      
       
     6 In the guideline judgment of Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 it was held, as a guideline, that the sentence for armed robbery should fall within the range of four to five years' imprisonment. That was for a category of case with the following features: 
      
       
        
       (i) young offender with little or no criminal history; 
        
        
       (ii) weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
        
        
       (iii) limited degree of planning; 
        
        
       (iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
        
        
       (v) victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;  
        
        
       (vi) small amount taken; 
        
        
       (vii) plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
        
       
     7 In Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [161], it was stated that the guideline in Henry relating to a plea of guilty should be understood as relating to a late plea of guilty. 
      
       
     8 In Murchie (1999) 108 A Crim R 482 it was held by a two judge bench, Simpson J and Smart AJ, that the Henry guideline applied equally to robbery in company for which the same maximum penalty was prescribed. We should apply that decision. (In Murchie, a sentence of substantially less than the guideline range was substituted but that was an exceptional case where the offender was suffering from a significant mental disturbance.) 
      
       
     9 A significant feature of the present case is the applicant's criminal history. The applicant was born on 14 August 1982. He was nineteen years of age at the time of the offence which is the subject of these proceedings. Prior to the present offence he was dealt with in the Children's Court on three occasions for offences which included stealing, driving a conveyance taken without consent and aggravated robbery. In respect of the last of those offences a community service order was made with which he failed to comply. Accordingly, subsequent to the offence on 2 July 2001, a control order of three months was imposed. Then followed a sentence for a fixed term of six months' imprisonment for a group of offences, committed after 2 July 2001, which included assault occasioning actual bodily harm, custody of a knife in a public place, larceny, obtaining money by deception on three occasions, and possessing a prohibited drug. (The sentence of six months was dated to commence concurrently with the control order of three months.) 
      
       
     10 In certain respects the present case is worse than the category of case specified in Henry. There are other considerations which go the other way. The first of these considerations is the applicant's criminal history prior to the offence on 2 July 2001. As I have mentioned, a feature of the category of case specified in Henry is an offender with no or little criminal history. That is not this case. 
      
       
     11 The second consideration is the applicant's subsequent criminal history, prior to sentence, which reflects poorly on the prospect of rehabilitation, calling for particular attention to specific deterrence. 
      
       
     12 The considerations which go the other way are as follows. First, the category of case in Henry includes a weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. And the category of case includes limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat of violence. Assuming for the present purpose that being in company equates with being armed with a weapon, there was no threat of violence in this case of the same order as a threat of violence with a weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 
      
       
     13 Secondly, the applicant is to be taken to have pleaded guilty at the earliest possible time, whereas the guideline in Henry applies to a category of case where the plea of guilty comes late. The applicant was entitled to a discount in the order of twenty per cent for the early plea of guilty. The guideline in Henry is predicated upon a lesser discount than that. 
      
       
     14 Next it has been argued that special consideration should be accorded to the applicant by reason of his youth. The applicant was almost nineteen years of age at the time of these offences. He is really on the borderline for such a consideration. However, in the light of the criminal history to which I have referred and the kind of behaviour which would not ordinarily be engaged in by young persons, there is limited scope for the application of the well-understood principles applicable in the case of a young offender.  
      
       
     15 There is little scope in this case for the youth of the applicant operating to throw the emphasis away from general deterrence and onto the prospect of rehabilitation, in view of the criminal history which indicates such a flagrant disregard for social responsibility.  
      
       
     16 A further consideration is that this applicant has the benefit of what I would regard as a generous finding on the part of the sentencing judge that more than two years is reasonably required under supervision on parole in order to facilitate rehabilitation, with consequent reduction of the non-parole period from what would have been three years under the statutory formula to two years. 
      
       
     17 The Henry guideline promulgates a four to five year term of imprisonment as a starting point in the category of case specified. A sentence of four years with a non-parole period of three years, absent special circumstances, would lie at the bottom of that range. Informed by the guideline judgment, as one must be, there are then to be recognised, in the present case, as I have indicated, considerations which make the present case worse than the Henry category, and other considerations which tend the other way.  
      
       
     18 Taking those other considerations into account I am not satisfied, in terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that a less severe sentence than that imposed is warranted in law and should have been passed. Accordingly, I would grant the application for leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     19 Greg James J: I agree. 
      
       
     20 Sperling J: The orders of the court will, accordingly, be as follows. The application for leave to appeal is granted. The appeal is dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Sperling J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Kinchington DCJ sitting in the District Court on 20 November 2001. 
      
       
     2 The applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest possible time to a charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm within intent to do grievous bodily harm. The maximum penalty for the offence is twenty five years. 
      
       
     3 On 20 November 2001 his Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of four years with a non parole period of one year and nine months, having found special circumstances. 
      
       
     4 The applicant submits that the sentencing judge failed to have sufficient regard to the following subjective features of the case: demonstrated rehabilitation, the plea of guilty and the effect of the sentence on the applicant’s family. It is also a ground of appeal that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     5 The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. The applicant was drinking at a hotel at Moree on 3 June 2001. Mr D McQuilty, the victim, was also drinking at the hotel with his girlfriend. The victim’s girlfriend was known to the applicant. Mr McQuilty was not. The applicant was intoxicated. The applicant had little memory for the episode and could not explain his conduct in retrospect.  
      
       
     6 It appears that the applicant attacked the victim utterly without provocation, punching him on the right shoulder. In the struggle which ensued, the applicant bit the victim’s right hand causing what appears to have been a superficial injury. The two were pulled apart but the applicant attacked the victim again and, this time, during the struggle, bit a portion from the victim’s nose exposing the bone. The victim was hospitalised for four days, underwent a skin graft, and at the time of sentencing required further surgery.  
      
       
     7 Those facts indicate serious objective features of the offence. It is further to be recognised, however, that grievous bodily harm imputes really serious injury. In that context, it has to be said that the injury inflicted in this case was by no means at the upper end of the range of injuries that are seen in relation to this offence. 
      
       
     8 There were strong subjective features in favour of the applicant. The applicant was thirty one years of age at the time of the offence. He was, at the time of the offence, addicted to alcohol, drinking to excess every day. That is not a mitigating factor. But he has not had a drink since the date of the offence. He had, prior to sentence, undergone rehabilitation treatment and had joined Alcoholics Anonymous. At the time of the offence, he was separated from his wife because of his alcohol addiction. They had since been reconciled, once the applicant had given up alcohol, and were now living together again. 
      
       
     9 One of the applicant’s children had a moderate intellectual disability and was hyperactive. He had difficulty understanding directions and did not take kindly to discipline. He needed constant supervision at home. The child reacted better to the applicant than he did to others. 
      
       
     10 There was no history of prior violent behaviour. There was a conviction for stealing in 1993 for which the applicant was fined $400. The sentencing judge, correctly, said he would not take that into account against the applicant.  
      
       
     11 Although the applicant would have been apprehended in any event because he was known to the victim’s girlfriend, the fact that the applicant handed himself in to the police was positive evidence before the sentencing judge of remorse and contrition. 
      
       
     12 Other evidence showed that the applicant was held in high regard by others and, since giving up alcohol, by his own family.  
      
       
     13 His Honour noted that the applicant’s family was in need of assistance in relation to the child to whom I have referred but did not think that the consideration was sufficient to avoid having to impose a custodial sentence. I have to say that I would not regard this aspect of the case as relevant at all, in view of the decisions of this Court which lay down that hardship to family members can be taken into account only where the circumstances are highly exceptional. 
      
       
     14 The applicant was entitled to a discount for the early plea in the order of twenty percent.  
      
       
     15 The steps taken by the applicant to rehabilitate himself provided a strong argument for leniency. This factor substantially reduced the need for punishment to deter the applicant from offending further in a similar way. 
      
       
     16 Notwithstanding the serious nature of the offence, the subjective features of this case are sufficiently strong to satisfy me that the sentence imposed was excessive. I would set the sentence aside and re-sentence the applicant.  
      
       
     17 I would begin with a head sentence of three years and six months discounted to a sentence of two years and nine months for the plea of guilty. That is approximately a twenty percent discount. I would find special circumstances for the reasons given by the sentencing judge. I would fix a non-parole period of one year and six months. Pursuant to s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, there would be an order directing the release of the applicant on parole at the end of the non-parole period. 
      
       
     18 I would make the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1. Grant the application for leave to appeal. 
        
        
       2. Allow the appeal. 
        
        
       3. Set aside the sentence. 
        
        
       4. Re-sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a period of two years and nine months commencing on 20 November 2001 with a non-parole period of one years and six months expiring on 19 May 2003. 
        
        
       5. Order that the applicant be released on parole at the end of the non-parole period. 
        
       
     19 Greg James J: I agree with the orders proposed by the learned presiding judge and the reasons that he gives therefor. 
      
       
     20 Sperling J: The orders of the court then will be as I have proposed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPERLING, J: I ask Greg James, J. to deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for an extension of time to appeal and for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on the applicant in the District Court on 9 April 1999 in respect of six counts in a s.51A document, five counts on an indictment and three counts on another indictment.  
      
       
     3 The offences charged in these various documents included, on the s.51A document, one charge of indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years, aged between 10 and 11 years, said to be committed during the year 1989, it being an offence under s.61E(1A), (3) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty prescribed at the time the offence was committed was six years penal servitude; one charge of attempting to have sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years, to wit, between 10 and 11 years, said to have been committed again in 1989, an offence under the then existing provisions of the Crimes Act 1900, s.66D, and s.66C(2), punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years penal servitude; and a further count of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 years, to wit, aged two years, said to have been committed in 1991, an offence under s.66A of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years custodial confinement. 
      
       
     4 The charges on the first of the two indictments presented were one charge of indecent assault of a male person between 1975 and 1980, an offence under s.81 of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by five years penal servitude; one count of indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 years, to wit aged six years, said to have been committed in the year 1976, to which s.76 of the Crimes Act 1900 had applied a maximum penalty of six years penal servitude; one charge of indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 years, to wit aged seven years, said to have been committed in the year 1977, again an offence under s.76 of the Crimes Act 1900 and similarly punishable; one charge of an offence against a person under the age of 16 years, to wit, eight years, in 1979, again, an offence under s.76 of the Crimes Act 1900 and similarly punishable; and an offence of aggravated indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 years, to wit aged five years, said to have been committed in July or August 1996, an offence under s.61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     5 In the other indictment there were three counts of inciting a person to an act of indecency, where the person was under 16 years of age, namely 10 years of age, and in each case those offences were said to have been committed in 1989, being offences under s.61E(2), (3) of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. 
      
       
     6 It can be seen that this is an horrific progression of offences of a sexual nature against very young children. It is not surprising that in those circumstances the trial judge was minded to pass severe sentences of imprisonment. For the offences on the s.51A document the trial judge passed a sentence on the first charge of a fixed term of imprisonment of two years to commence on 1 December 1998. That sentence was to be served concurrently with all other sentences. 
      
       
     7 On the charge of attempt to have sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years, the trial judge passed a sentence of a fixed term of three years imprisonment wholly concurrent. On the charge of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years, to wit aged two years, his Honour passed a sentence comprising a minimum term of six years penal servitude and an additional term of four years penal servitude. All other sentences were concurrent with this and with each other. 
      
       
     8 On the indictment in which the four offences of indecent assault had been charged, on each count of indecent assault his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of two years; and for the count of aggravated indecent assault, a fixed term of three years. 
      
       
     9 On the other indictment on each count his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months. The structure of the sentences therefore it may be seen, as turning on the sentence for the crime of sexual intercourse with the two year old as attracting the major sentence, and the other sentences being entirely subsumed by reason of their concurrence with that sentence. 
      
       
     10 It becomes apparent too that as at the hearing of this matter, all the sentences but that for the intercourse with the two year old have been served. Notwithstanding the delay in the matter coming forward, the extension of time is sought upon the basis of matters set out in affidavits that have been read in these proceedings. It is unnecessary to refer to the detail of those affidavits, since, except in one respect, no challenge is made to the matters of fact referred to therein, and the extension of time is, except insofar as it might be affected by the merits of the appeal, unopposed by the Crown. 
      
       
     11 We have in the event heard full argument on the application for leave to appeal and on the appeal. In my view, in those circumstances, the extension of time and the application for leave to appeal for that reason alone should be granted. 
      
       
     12 The appeal is, however, in nature, highly confined. Recognising that the other sentences have been served, it is sought only to appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the sexual intercourse with the two year old. The written submissions filed in support of that appeal are within limited confines. Attention is drawn to the applicant’s admission that he had to some degree penetrated the body of the baby, and reliance is placed upon his making of that admission to the police, and in his plea, particularly for the purpose of contending that the trial judge fell into error by failing to afford to the applicant in respect of that sentence a discount of the kind referred to in The Queen v. Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, that being a discount to which s.23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 now relates. 
      
       
     13 Section 23 provides that a court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose, having regard to the degree to which an offender has assisted. In deciding whether to impose that lesser sentence, s.23 requires that enumerated matters set forth in s.23(2) be the subject of consideration, one of which is the nature and extent of the assistance. Others relate to the significance and usefulness of assistance, the timeliness of assistance, whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial sentences in consequence of the assistance and the likelihood of the commission of further offences upon release. 
      
       
     14 But all of those matters and the extent to which a court might afford some such discount as the Ellis discount are qualified by s.23(3), which provides that:- 
      
       
        
         
         “A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences.” 
         
        
       
     15 That principle also applies at common law. 
      
       
     16 It is contended that although the trial judge gave a discount to the applicant on the sentences for certain of the charges, he failed to enunciate expressly a discount for the acknowledging of his acts on this charge to the police, and thus failure was such as to show the sentence for failing to include an appropriate discount on this basis was excessive, so that the court would conclude that a lesser sentence was warranted in law, and should have been passed, thus attracting the application of s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
      
       
     17 In the oral submissions reference was made to the structure of the sentence as possibly having infringed the principles enunciated by the High Court in Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 but no discrete ground of appeal was advanced on that basis. It can be seen that no sentence was cumulated and I have already referred to the subsuming of each sentence in that passed for the offence under appeal but, although reference was made to this matter in argument, since the applicant in the circumstances confined the challenge to the length of the sentence remaining to be fully served, it is not necessary, now, to consider whether there was an error of the Pearce kind. 
      
       
     18 The Crown conceded that the trial judge may have failed to apply the principles in Pearce (supra), but contended that had the sentences been accumulated in accordance with Pearce (supra) no lesser sentence on this charge in overall effect would have properly resulted and that there was no such material error in what had occurred, so as to enable the application of s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In particular, it was contended that a limitation, as here, of the appeal to only one of a number of sentences imposed as part of a complex, where the others have been served, and where the appeal is in reliance on a Pearce error, would or could produce, should the argument be successful, an entirely artificial result arising in effect from the delay of the appeal. 
      
       
     19 The Crown submitted that in those circumstances, either leave should be refused or the appeal dismissed, unless the sentence was manifestly excessive when considered, having regard to the objective criminality of the events the subject of that count in the context of the crimes attracting the other sentences, and the subjective circumstances of the applicant. 
      
       
     20 The Crown in this case did not seek to resile from its concession that the extension of time should be granted to enable the court to hear the appeal. Its submission therefore concluded that in this regard either the Pearce problem should not be regarded as affecting practically the result, or alternatively, the sentence in any event considered appropriately as a discrete sentence was not such as to attract the application of s.6(3).  
      
       
     21 As I have said, it is not necessary to turn to the consideration here of whether there has been some procedural error arising from the failure of the trial judge so long ago to apply the principles in Pearce (supra), since it is not contended on the applicant’s part that the appeal should be allowed on that basis. It is, however, contended for the applicant that the failure to afford the Ellis discount, which it is contended can be concluded as not afforded from the effect of certain passages of the trial judge’s remarks on sentence, to which I will turn in a moment, showed error if this sentence were to be considered in isolation and in regard to its objective criminality, even in context and considering the subjective circumstances notwithstanding the sentence was originally part of a complex of sentencing 
      
       
     22 It was submitted that the offence should be considered as low on the scale of objective criminality, in particular because of the asserted limited degree of penetration, and that a high degree of leniency should be attracted to the applicant’s admission of the fact of penetration, which could not otherwise have been proved.  
      
       
     23 It was submitted he went to the police and disclosed his own criminality, in circumstances where, considering the age of the victim and the circumstances of the offence, at least the penetration aspect of it, would not otherwise have been disclosed; that he went to the police at a time when the parents of the victim were only “considering” whether or not the matter should be drawn to the attention of the police and hence, although he was aware of that possibility, he nonetheless still should receive the maximum discount. 
      
       
     24 It was submitted that although there were others who knew of his criminality, they were persons who bore such a relationship to him by means of either sharing a common religious belief or being his wife, that they were unlikely to disclose the matter. It was submitted that the course he took in respect of this and the other offences of apologising to the parents before going to the police, should not in any way have disqualified him from receiving the benefit of that discount. 
      
       
     25 Our attention was drawn to the decision of this court in The Queen v. CDH [2002] NSWCCA 103 and, in particular, the passage quoted in that decision from the judgment of Kirby, J. in Ryan v. The Queen [2001] HCA 21 indicating that, where there had been disclosure of criminality which otherwise might not have been disclosed, a significant discount should be given. 
      
       
     26 I turn to his Honour’s remarks on sentence. He referred to the detail of the offences. It is not necessary in this judgment to repeat that detail. Insofar as a submission was made to us that the other offences were offences of touching, it is sufficient to say that, although they did not involve, except in one case where oral sex was committed, actual penetration, they did involve circumstances of very serious criminal sexual activity. 
      
       
     27 His Honour referred to matters which, in the offender’s own background, had to receive consideration, including that he himself was the victim of sexual assault. He referred to the offender’s own attempts to obtain medical assistance for what was viewed by the offender and his wife as an illness. He referred to medical evidence that the offender did not “go out of his way plotting or stalking little girls”. His Honour referred to the doctor’s view that the offender did not seem to have sexual fantasies or urges. 
      
       
     28 His Honour expressed the view that he was impressed with the evidence of the applicant’s wife, and her support for him. He considered the question of the circumstances under which the reporting to the police occurred. In that regard his Honour adverted specifically to one of the offences as attracting the Ellis principle. His Honour continued:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""However, the other matters involving people from the church were the subject of complaints from the families of the three girls, which were passed on to at least one member of the church who passed the complaints to the prisoner, and his wife. Whilst very good arguments have been presented both ways on this question, he deserves – when I say ‘deserves’ he will get – full credit, and as I have already announced in the sentence, receive full credit for advising the police about the [G] matters. However, certainly one family, that is BR's mother and father – were concerned around about the time he reported those matters to the police. I think, like most human actions, his reporting to the police at that time was as a result of a number of factors. It was not totally therapeutic: meaning thereby, to get these matters off his chest, I think it was, at least in part, activated by the activities of the parents or some of the parents of the victims.” 
         
        
       
     29 It is contended, in relation to that extract, that that would indicate that no Ellis discount referable to the offences for which the relevant sentence was passed was afforded to the prisoner by the trial judge. I do not accept that submission. The trial judge has plainly referred to the reporting to the police. He has referred to the motivation for that report and, in particular, whether it was for therapeutic purposes. He has not, I think one should conclude, afforded to the appellant the benefit of a finding that there were no circumstances other than his own conscience, which might have moved him to come forward, because his Honour has referred to the family of the victim being concerned around about the time he reported those matters to the police. 
      
       
     30 His Honour held that he thought that the coming forward was at least in part activated by the activities of the parents, or some of the parents of the victims. 
      
       
     31 Really, the conclusion appears to be that the volunteering of assistance as to his own criminality in this particular respect was not an unalloyed emanation of his own conscience. I do not conclude from that that the trial judge fell into appellable error in failing to accord an Ellis discount, consider that the Ellis discount was referred to and this sentence was part of a complex of sentences to at least some of which the Ellis discount was expressly related. 
      
       
     32 Although submissions were made to suggest that the sentence was too severe, having regard to its objective criminality and the subjective circumstances relevant to the offender, when I have regard to the sentence itself, even having regard to the prospect that it might have been passed in accordance with a now obsolete attitude to structuring a sentence to reflect totality prior to the decision in Pearce (surpa), I am not prepared to conclude that the sentence was, even if regard had been had to an absence of an express enunciation of an Ellis discount, excessive. 
      
       
     33 Indeed, in my view, not only is no lesser sentence warranted in law, but any lesser sentence would have been unreasonably disproportionate even if it had been a lesser sentence by reason of the application of an Ellis discount. 
      
       
     34 I am fortified in my conclusion that his Honour did not fall into error in the way in which he treated that matter in his remarks on sentence, by the fact that the offender did not give evidence as to his intent to confess and assist or as to the course he took. Our attention was drawn to various passages of the evidence of his wife in the transcript. They were relied on rather than any evidence of the offender. 
      
       
     35 It was submitted, and properly, to us, that the trial judge regarded her as an estimable witness. However, my analysis of those passages does not lead me to conclude that there is a secure foundation for a finding, which it was submitted, it was incumbent on the trial judge to make, that a specific Ellis discount should be allowed for this offence on the basis he came forward and volunteered the information without regard to the activities of the parents. 
      
       
     36 The conclusion, therefore, I have reached in all the circumstances of this appeal is that, although the extension of time should be granted and the application for leave to appeal allowed, for the reasons I have expressed, the appeal itself should be dismissed. Therefore I propose those orders. 
      
       
     37 SPERLING, J: I agree. I would add the following observation. It seems to me that the application for leave to appeal proceeds upon a fiction. 
      
       
     38 It is apparent that the sentence imposed for the offence made the subject of the appeal was intended by the sentencing judge to cover the totality of criminality involved in all of the offences for which the applicant was being sentenced. In contrast, the appeal proceeds upon the basis that that sentence should be assessed as a sentence exclusively for the offence made the subject of the appeal. The fact that the sentencing judge did not structure the sentences in accordance with the decision in Regina v. Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 does not mean that the sentence made the subject of the appeal is translated into something which it is not. 
      
       
     39 For those reasons, I would doubt that this is an appropriate matter in which to grant leave to appeal on the basis upon which the application is made. However, for the reasons given by Greg James, J., even on the basis of the fiction which the applicant asks the court to accept, the sentence - treated as one exclusively for the offence to which it relates - is not shown to be one warranting the intervention of this court. 
      
       
     40 In these circumstances, I agree that it is expedient to grant both the application for extension of time and the application for leave to appeal, in order that the matter may be disposed of on the basis advanced on behalf of the applicant. 41 I agree with the orders proposed by Greg James, J. 
      
       
     42 They will be the orders of the court.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence. An appeal against sentence may be brought under s.5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 only by leave. On such an application the court is empowered by s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 if it is of opinion that some other sentence more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed to quash the sentence and to pass such other sentence in substitution therefore but s.6(3) continues that, “in any other case the court shall dismiss the appeal”. 
      
       
     2 In the present case the applicant pleaded guilty initially in the Central Local Court and pursuant to s.51A of the Justices Act 1902 was committed for trial to the District Court. Subsequently in the District Court, on 10 December 2001 he adhered to his pleas. The relevant offences were: the first, an offence of robbery in company, an offence under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 committed on the 26 February 2001; the second, robbery and at the time depriving a person of his liberty, committed on 14 March 2001, an offence under s.95(1) and (2)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 and a second offence of robbery and at the time depriving a person of his liberty committed at the same time and place but on a different person. All three of those offences are not only serious offences but are punishable by maximum sentences of 20 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     3 On 4 February 2002 the applicant was sentenced in respect of those crimes. For the first offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months to date from 4 February 2002. The applicant had been at liberty following his arrest on 18 June 2001 until sentenced by the learned District Court Judge on 4 February 2002. 
      
       
     4 For the second offence the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three years and six months and a non-parole period of 18 months was imposed on that sentence. Both the sentence and the non-parole period were to date from 4 February 2002. 
      
       
     5 For the third sentence a similar head sentence and non-parole period were imposed. 
      
       
     6 The effect, therefore, in totality was that the applicant was subject to a sentence of imprisonment to commence from the time he went into custody and to continue for three years and six months although the non-parole period of 18 months coupled with the concurrent 18 months fixed term would require him to spend at least 18 months in custody.  
      
       
     7 The short facts of the commission of the offences were:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""As to the first count. At about 2.30 pm on Monday 26 February last year, Ka Tsun Yeung was leaving the toilets at the Market City Shopping Centre in Haymarket when he was confronted by a young man named Pong Dang and yourself. During the conversation that followed, demands were made on Yeung, firstly for his wallet, secondly for his credit cards and money, and thirdly for his mobile phone. Eventually, Yeung handed over $300 or that money was taken from his wallet. After that money was taken his mobile phone was also taken and you and your co-offender Dang, left the area. 
         
        
        
         
         As to the second and third offences, at about 6.30 pm on Wednesday 14 March last year, two young men named Richard Loggy and Liam Tong were shopping at Paddy's Markets also in the Haymarket area when they were confronted by yourself, Pong Dang and a young man by the name of Arnold Lee. They were asked whether they were members of a gang. Demands were then made for their wallets ostensibly so that their identification could be checked out. Key cards were taken from each of their wallets and demands were made of them for their pin numbers. Initially the pin numbers that they gave were not the correct numbers. After getting the pin numbers however, two of your group left and one remained in effect to detain Loggy and Tong. Those two subsequently returned having ascertained that the pin numbers were not the correct numbers and after threatening your two victims, the correct pin numbers were obtained and the two men again left. Shortly thereafter the man that remained received a phone call where upon he handed back the wallets to your two victims and they were allowed to leave. Your two victims subsequently checked their bank accounts and Loggy found that $780 had been withdrawn from his bank account while $550 had been drawn from Tong's bank account."" 
         
        
       
     8 The applicant had a clear prior record. He was a young single man, the trial judge noted, having been aged 19 at the time of the commission of the offences. His family were refugees from Vietnam and his eduction in Australia had been disrupted although he had been a reasonable student with a high degree of intelligence. In the few years prior to these offences his domestic relationship with his father had broken down. He left home. He fell under the influence of the co offender, Dang, and was sharing premises with him at the time of the commission of the offences. 
      
       
     9 The trial judge noted the influence of the co-offender Dang and, in particular, held that the offender had been subject to the pernicious influence of that person as inducing him to commit the crimes in question. However the trial judge, whilst accepting he was not the instigator of the robberies, was satisfied that, for reasons best known to the applicant himself, he played an active role in each of them. 
      
       
     10 The trial judge gave particular attention to the applicant’s prospects for rehabilitation. He noted the return of the applicant to his family and the support of that family. He noted the applicant had, between arrest and coming forward for sentence, terminated his association with those who had led the applicant into the committing of the offences. He gave particular attention to the entirely favourable report of Dr. Christopher Lennings and the favourable pre-sentence report of Miss Pauline Smith. Those reports, his Honour concluded, showed that the applicant, although an intelligent person, had made a poor choice of associates who had led him into the commission of the offences and he had real further prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Those two reports are most encouraging, both to the court and they should be encouraging to you. You have the prospects of being able to make something of your life after you put your criminality behind you."" 
         
        
       
     11 His Honour noted the evidence of the applicant and that of his sister and concluded that there were positive steps in the process of rehabilitation as a consequence of reconciliation with the family. There was remorse, contrition and a determination by the applicant to put his life in order. His Honour was of the view that there should be a full discount for the plea of guilty and for remorse and contrition. 
      
       
     12 His Honour had regard to the sentence passed upon the co offender for a number of crimes which included the present crime and which, in totality, amounted to a sentence with an overall term of six years imprisonment and a non parole period of four years but concluded that the applicant’s criminality, by comparison with the overall criminality of Dang, was such that parity principles hardly applied since Dang had committed so many more offences. He also concluded that Dang was “the leader of the push and got you involved in this criminal activity.”  
      
       
     13 However, all of this being said his Honour then turned to the nature of the offences, their prevalence and the appropriateness, when dealing with such offences, of emphasising, in the context of what his Honour had referred to relating to the offender’s personal movement towards rehabilitation, of the necessity for both specific and general deterrence. 
      
       
     14 At page 7 of his remarks on sentence his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Robberies of the nature to which you have pleaded guilty are far too prevalent in our society at the present time. While the whole of the material herein would tend to indicate that you became involved in this criminal activity as a result of falling under the influence of a bad crowd, that fact while it might explain how you came to be involved in committing these three offences, does not excuse you from participating in any one of them. To my mind the public at large and in particular young people should be allowed to walk about the streets of this city without fear of being stood over, intimidated and robbed by groups of young men such as you were involved with when you committed these two offences. Gangs of young men seem to be roaming the streets of our city and in particular in the Haymarket area and they seem to think that if they act aggressively they will grow in stature in the eyes of others and that they can intimidate and rob people at their will. Such groups must be discouraged from acting in that way. 
         
        
        
         
         In these circumstances, both the concepts of specific and general deterrent are important concepts in a case such as this and to my mind require me to subject persons such as yourself to a severe penalty for partaking in the criminal behaviour I have previously identified. While I accept that you were not the instigator of either robbery, I am satisfied for reasons best known to yourself, you played an active role in each of them. In my opinion the community's abhorrence to this type of criminal behaviour can only be appeased as I previously indicated by subjecting you to a custodial sentence of some severity as it must be brought home not only to you but also to groups of young men or gangs of young men who roam and wander the streets of this city, that if they attempt or do intimidate law abiding citizens and rob them of their lawful property, that if they do so and they are caught they will be severely dealt with by this court."" 
         
        
       
     15 It was in the light of those remarks that his Honour came to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the efforts the applicant had made for rehabilitation, it was necessary to subject the applicant to the sentences he passed. He said, concerning the sentences:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""… I have fixed the non-parole period in the special circumstances of your case. In particular because I am satisfied that, not only should you be encouraged while in custody to continue with your efforts to rehabilitate yourself, but also because of your release from custody you probably will need professional help and guidance to help you to become a law abiding citizen."" 
         
        
       
     16 His Honour thereafter made a recommendation that the Department consider placing the applicant in a “minimum security institution"" and should afford him an opportunity to further his education and continue with his rehabilitation. He expressed the hope that the applicant would be released on parole at the first available opportunity.  
      
       
     17 It is in that context that the submissions made on behalf of the applicant contend that the trial judge erred, firstly, in failing to have regard to other sentencing options and, secondly, in failing to give sufficient regard to the sentences passed upon Dang they being such, so it is said, as to have left the applicant with a legitimate sense of grievance in having been dealt with, as he had, although Dang had been dealt with as he had for the more extensive range of crimes. 
      
       
     18 The written submissions filed contend that, in the light of seven factors, even taking into account totality, the trial Judge should have considered, particularly having regard to the applicant’s rehabilitation and the community’s interest in the applicant’s rehabilitation, the imposition of a non custodial sentence or at least the imposition of a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. Those factors are – the age of the applicant, the absence of prior offences, that it was the first time in custody, that the offences were committed at a time of family breakdown, that he was pushed into the offences by the criminally experienced co-offender, that there was positive rehabilitation and family support. 
      
       
     19 It was submitted that the applicant would not have committed the offences but for a breakdown in his family life, his vulnerable state, the absence of support from a trustworthy person, and was making every effort to rehabilitate himself.  
      
       
     20 Dr. Lennings’ recommendation that, should a non-custodial sentence be considered, Mr. Nguyen would be likely to make an excellent response to it, was specifically referred to. 
      
       
     21 In my view this submission, while well intentioned, mistakes the function of this court. The trial judge, in my view, gave consideration to all these matters. He gave consideration as to whether a custodial sentence should have been imposed. He did not expressly make reference to non-custodial options. I do not see that, in failing to make reference to non-custodial options when deciding that there must be a custodial sentence amounts to any such error in reasoning or in procedure as would warrant the interference of this court.  
      
       
     22 In any event the trial judge took into account all of the matters referred to and emphasised them in his reasons. The considerations, however, that he had to take into account were not limited to the rehabilitation of the individual offender, or even the community’s interest in the rehabilitation of the individual offender. 
      
       
     23 I see no error in the trial judge having regard to both specific and general deterrence in the context of this case, nor in the trial judge imposing a sentence which, as far as the non parole period was concerned, to my mind had in it an element of leniency. 
      
       
     24 These were serious offences and his Honour’s remarks as to principle and how these offences are required to be dealt with by the courts accord with a long series of decisions in this court. I do not regard that ground of appeal as made out. 
      
       
     25 In that regard I should say that counsel valiantly attempted in his appeal submissions to suggest ways in which the sentences might be reconstructed to involve either periodic detention or a suspended sentence such as to diminish that period of time the offender would have to spend in custody. To my mind these attempts were artificial. Indeed as to one of them, that regarding periodic detention, it fell foul of s.70 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In any event, to my mind, 18 months was the least period the offender should spend in custody for these offences so that I cannot say some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed at least insofar as the non parole period was concerned. 
      
       
     26 As to the argument concerning the parity of this sentence with Dang, true it is Dang might have received, had we known the full facts for the offences for which he was sentenced, a lenient sentence but that is not the point. Absent the sort of considerations to which the High Court averted in Postiglione v. The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295, that submission is not made out either. His Honour adequately took into account Dang’s role in inducing the applicant to commit the offences but his Honour appropriately had regard to what the applicant did himself in the commission of the offences. I, therefore, conclude that, having regard to s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, leave should be granted, but the appeal is dismissed. 
      
       
     27 SPERLING, J: I agree. The orders of the court will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

      REGINA v Earl HEATLEY 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 THE COURT: Earl Heatley (the appellant) appeals against three convictions at the Central Criminal Court on 13 October 1997.  
      
       
     2 The appellant was arraigned before McInerney J and a jury of twelve at the Central Criminal Court, Sydney on 8 September 1997 upon an indictment containing three counts. 
      
       
     3 The first count was that on 1 October 1994 he murdered Desmond Forrest Clarke Thompson. The second count was that he murdered Paul Heatley. Both these counts were pursuant to s 18 of the Crimes Act, 1900 (the Act). The third count was that he maliciously wounded Thomas Alan Bithel pursuant to s 33 of the Act. The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count. 
      
       
     4 Michael John Stevens was tried jointly with the appellant on one count of concealing a serious offence pursuant to s 316(1) of the Act.  
      
       
     5 On 13 October 1997 the appellant was convicted on all counts and Michael Stevens was acquitted.  
      
       
     6 On 27 February 1998, his Honour sentenced the appellant to penal servitude for life in relation to the conviction on the first count. In relation to the second count the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of twenty years penal servitude to commence on 6 October 1994 and to expire on 5 October 2014. In relation to the third count the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of fifteen years penal servitude to commence on 6 October 1994 and to expire on 5 October 2009.  
      
       
     7 Paul Heatley, who is the alleged victim in the second murder count, was the appellant’s brother. Both the appellant and Paul Heatley had served long sentences for serious crime. As at the date of the alleged murders, the appellant was residing with Paul (whose nickname was Ned) and Paul’s de facto wife Marie Jane Clarke at 7 Wayland Avenue, Lidcombe. Also resident in that home was Melissa (then aged seven) who is Marie’s daughter by her relationship with Paul. From time to time Michael Heatley, Paul’s son from a previous relationship also resided in that home. 
      
       
     8 Paul also had two other children from the earlier relationship, namely, Karyn Heatley and Christine Tracy Heatley. 
      
       
     9 Christine lived with her partner Maher Abadlla in an apartment at Bondi. Karyn lived with her partner Roger Bissett in a house at Lethbridge Park.  
      
       
     10 Marie Clarke owned a Ford Falcon silver metallic motor vehicle of about 1989 vintage and the appellant owned a Ford Escort motor vehicle. Both these vehicles were kept at Wayland Avenue.  
      
       
     11 The appellant has a second brother, Tony Heatley (whose nickname is Grub).  
      
       
        
       The Crown Case. 
        
       
     12 The Crown case can be briefly summarised as follows. The late Desmond Thompson, who is the alleged victim in the first murder count, was the owner of a factory located in a complex of factories at Leighton Place, Asquith. The business was conducted through the company D.F.C. Thompson Pty Limited. The factory premises were used for the storage of various chemicals including substances which are the precursor in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. 
      
       
     13 The Crown case was that the appellant and Paul Heatley were involved on 1 October 1994 (which was a Saturday) in an attempted armed robbery of those premises. It would appear that other people whose identity is unknown may have been involved. 
      
       
     14 At approximately 1.30 pm, whilst cleaning the premises, Mr Thomas Bithel (the alleged victim in the third count) became aware of the presence of two offenders. One wore a mask, which was described as ribbed material from the chin to the top of the head with no eyeholes, of a beanie style, but open at the top. According to the Crown case this was the appellant. This “mask” matched the description of the “cut-off arm” of a brown pullover found near the body of the deceased Paul Heatley, after the attempted robbery. 
      
       
     15 The Crown case was that prior to Mr Bithel becoming aware of the offenders’ presence, they had tied Mr Thompson up apparently using white adhesive tape and black plastic tie clips (of the kind used by electricians) and left him in the office area. Some witnesses use the description black plastic cable ties. However, it is obvious that they are referring to the same piece of equipment as black plastic tie clips. For the sake of uniformity we shall adopt the latter description throughout this judgment. 
      
       
     16 Mr Bithel deposed that as he was operating a floor scrubber, he heard a voice saying, “Okay, son, shut the machine off”. 
      
       
     17 As Mr Bithel turned around he observed the masked man had what appeared to be a weapon in his hand with a yellow piece of towelling draped over it. The man standing next to him was unmasked but he had rubber gloves on his hands. According to the Crown case the latter person was Paul Heatley. 
      
       
     18 The voice said “Don’t do anything stupid, come with us”. Mr Bithel was then pushed towards the plastic doors that separated the warehouse from the loading dock and the office area in which Mr Thompson had been detained. 
      
       
     19 After passing through the doors, Mr Bithel observed that Mr Thompson was in the office, but he was no longer bound and he was speaking on the telephone. 
      
       
     20 The unmasked man then said, “He’s on the bloody phone, he’s on the bloody phone”. He rushed down the factory and went into the office. He then grabbed the phone from Mr Thompson, punched him in the face and tried to rip the phone cord out of the connection. Then the unmasked man turned around and hit Mr Thompson again and rushed into the foyer, described as a little vestibule. He then shouted out “He’s called them, he’s bloody called them”, and commenced to leave the vestibule.  
      
       
     21 Mr Bithel noticed that Mr Thompson ran out and tackled the unmasked man. His evidence was that the man “… grabbed hold of him around the shirt, around the neck and they were struggling” (T 25). This struggle occurred just inside the vestibule by the door entrance.  
      
       
     22 The unmasked man then cried out, “Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him”, whereupon Mr Bithel heard a gun go off, just to his right side and behind him. 
      
       
     23 Mr Bithel saw Mr Thompson lurch sideways. Then he heard another shot and a bullet hit his left arm totally shattering the arm. He also heard a third shot.  
      
       
     24 He then saw the two offenders leaving the building. 
      
       
     25 Mr Bithel then asked a fellow employee, Cameron Scott, to ring the police and the ambulance. He then looked across the car park and observed the unmasked man lying on the ground of the car park. 
      
       
     26 Mr Scott deposed that he heard three or four shots before coming to Mr Bithel’s aid.  
      
       
     27 Shortly thereafter police and ambulance attended the scene. There was detailed evidence placed before the jury as to the position of the bodies of the two deceased men and the position of four spent cartridge shells and bullet fragments which were subsequently located. 
      
       
     28 Dr Peter Ellis, forensic pathologist, conducted a post mortem examination on Mr Thompson on 2 October. Dr Ellis detected two wounds which were said to be caused by one projectile entering near the right ear and exiting below the jaw on the lower part of the left side of the neck, having been deflected by the bottom of the skull. Three further wounds were detected, the bullet having entered the right upper arm, exited the inside of the upper arm and then immediately entered the chest, coming to rest inside the skin where it was found on post mortem. This latter bullet damaged one of the ribs on the right hand side, and also went through the right lung into the cavity around the heart. Finally, there were wounds caused by a bullet entering and exiting the left thigh. 
      
       
     29 Dr Ellis also conducted a post mortem examination on 2 October of Paul Heatley. He detected an entry wound on the left side of the chest just underneath the armpit, and an exit wound lower down on the right side of the chest. Death was said to have been caused by damage to the heart and both lungs caused by the path of the bullet. Morphine was found in the liver, indicating the consumption of heroin or morphine prior to death.  
      
       
     30 Dr Ellis agreed in cross-examination that there was no evidence based on the wounds analysed on the two bodies to suggest that any bullet passed from one body into another (T211). 
      
       
     31 It appears that five shots were fired, although only four spent cartridge cases were found. None of these was located outside the factory in the vicinity of Paul Heatley’s body. 
      
       
     32 Detective Ray Grima from the Forensic Ballistic Section of the New South Wales Police attended the crime scene. He noted that green rubber gloves were found on the body of Paul Heatley, and described a trail of apparent blood between the body and the plastic doors in the factory. The cartridge cases which were examined, demonstrated that they had all come from the one weapon, said to be a self-loading pistol, probably a Luger manufactured weapon. The complete bullets removed from the body of Mr Thompson and the arm of Mr Bithel had the characteristics of being discharged from a 7.65 mm parabellum cartridge. The pistol has never been located. 
      
       
     33 Having been present during Dr Ellis’ post mortem examination, Detective Grima formed the opinion, from the markings around the entry wound to the right side of Mr Thompson’s head that the muzzle of the weapon was in near contact at the time of discharge (T262-269). 
      
       
     34 A Toyota Lite Ace van registered number LEL-352, was observed by police on 3 October in Leighton Place, closed but unlocked, with the windows open and the key in the ignition. It was parked 160 metres from the factory premises.  
      
       
     35 Investigation established that the van had been purchased from a car dealer in Lewisham on the day of the offences, probably between 11 am and 12 midday. A later estimate was said to be 1.30 to 2 pm. It was sold to a man described as being around twenty-six to twenty-eight years of age, of Caucasian appearance, who gave a false name and address.  
      
       
     36 Detective Forbes deposed that police located a brown “Just Jeans” jumper with the sleeves removed in the van. This matched the sleeve found near the body of Paul Heatley. The other sleeve was not located. Police also found a brown serrated knife, which Marie Clarke later identified as being from her cutlery drawer. Police also found six white (sic) plastic tie clips in the van (T73). 
      
       
     37 The appellant gave evidence in support of his alibi. He said that at the time of the robbery he was at a TAB in the Lidcombe area with Michael Heatley. He also denied making any admission to the police or the lay witnesses. 
      
       
     38 McInerney J described as “the cornerstone of the Crown case” against the appellant, the admissions alleged to have been made by the appellant to family members on the afternoon and night of 1 October, and to a limited extent afterwards. We shall refer later in a little detail to the evidence given by the witnesses relied upon by the Crown to establish the alleged admissions.  
      
       
     39 For present purposes it is sufficient to note that Marie Clarke gave first hand evidence of admissions having been made. Karyn Heatley did not seek to resile from her statements to the police which referred to admissions made to her, but refreshed her memory from the statements during the course of her evidence. 
      
       
     40 Michael Heatley gave first hand evidence of some admissions but resiled from significant parts of his statement. Christine Heatley and Roger Bissett resiled from their statements and his Honour granted the Crown Prosecutor leave to cross-examine these latter three witnesses, pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995, as unfavourable witnesses. No such application was necessary in respect of Marie Clarke and Karyn Heatley, who both adhered to their statements. 
      
       
        
       Grounds of Appeal. 
        
       
     41 There were twelve grounds of appeal originally filed. It is convenient, however, to consider in the first instance the sixth ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       The Sixth Ground of Appeal. 
        
       
     42 The sixth ground of appeal alleged that his Honour had given erroneous directions in relation to the witnesses who had been declared unfavourable. 
      
       
     43 With regard to the evidence of those witnesses, his Honour gave the following directions to the jury during the course of his summing-up: 
      
       
        
         
         “There has been considerable cross examination in this case and of course, members of the jury, as has been pointed out to you, and I will come to the way you deal with the evidence of the young people, if one can describe them as that, as I go along with this summing up. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown was given permission by me to cross examine various witnesses. Normally when the Crown calls a witness they cannot cross examine. The cross examiner can put suggestions to witnesses, ‘I put to you’, whereas when you are leading evidence, that is not available, but because I am entitled under the evidence Act in this State, if I am satisfied, I can grant the Crown leave to cross examine witnesses about previous statements that they have made, and this is a very important issue in this case, members of the jury, probably the most important issue that you will have to decide, what you make of those statements that those people have made to the police,  
         because the Crown is entitled to rely on those statement as evidence of the facts 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         So you can see how important those statements are, and what you make of them. It is entirely what you make of them, but they are, you might think, the cornerstone or the crux of the Crown case. If you were to say, ‘I am in doubt about all those statements. I believe they were lying when they made them’, then you will find the accused not guilty.” (SU 15-16) (Our emphasis.) 
         
        
       
     44 And later: 
      
       
        
         
         “If you are not prepared to act on and accept the evidence of Marie Clarke and to accept the statements made by Christine, Michael, Karyn and Roger Bissett at the time to the police, then it seems to me that you would have no alternative but to find him not guilty.” (SU 20-21) 
         
        
       
     45 And later: 
      
       
        
         
         “You look at this evidence and bring your common sense to bear and see whether that makes sense. The real issue in this case, as I have said, is whether you accept, as you are entitled to do with evidence of the facts, the statements made by them at the time. You are entitled to disregard their evidence before you and you are entitled to accept their statements to the police as revealing the true facts of what the accused had told them after 1 October and what they had observed. 
         
        
        
         
         If, however, you have a doubt that is reasonable about the accuracy of those statements, then you would conclude in the accused’s favour.” (SU 21-22) 
         
        
       
     46 And later: 
      
       
        
         
         “The major issue you will have to decide in this case is whether the original statements which Roger Bissett and the children made to the police on 6 October set out the true facts as they existed at the time. As I have explained to you, you are entitled, if you are so minded, to accept what they said in the statements as the real version of the facts and if you are satisfied that those facts are true you could then conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the offences with which he is charged. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown, as I understand their case, submits to you that you would have no hesitation in rejecting the majority of the evidence they have given in this court. That when you examine the evidence you will be driven to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the original statements set out the true version. The Crown says the unsatisfactory attempts to explain how they were seized with the detail of what occurred and what you know occurred would lead you to conclude that even in their wildest imaginations they would have been unable to come up with the versions that they did and at least the attempts of Michael Heatley, Roger Bissett and others to get around these statements is at least implausible. So that is the issue that the Crown puts to you in respect of those matters. Let us be honest about it, those statements are the cornerstone of the Crown case.” (SU 58-59) 
         
        
       
     47 These directions were consistent with the state of the law as it was understood at the time of the summing-up. In short, his Honour allowed the alleged admissions from which Christine and Michael Heatley and Roger Bissett had resiled in evidence, to go before the jury as evidence of the facts going to establish the appellant’s guilt, if the jury accepted beyond reasonable doubt that the admissions had been made to the three witnesses by the appellant, as recorded in their statements.  
      
       
     48 McInerney J was apparently relying upon s 60 of the Evidence Act 1995 to support the direction which he gave. Section 60 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation.” 
         
        
       
     49 However, in Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594, the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne & Callinan JJ) held that s 60 did not convert evidence of what was said, out of court, into evidence of some fact that the person speaking out of court did not intend to assert. Thus the statements by the three abovementioned witnesses to the police that the appellant had stated to them that he had done certain things, could not be converted into evidence that the appellant had in fact done those things.  
      
       
     50 The effect of Lee is, therefore, that his Honour’s direction was erroneous. Because of the importance of the admissions which the appellant allegedly made to the three witnesses who were declared to be unfavourable to the Crown, it is not a case which allows for the application of the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, as amended. As Kirby J pointed out in Festa v The Queen (2001) 176 ALJR 291 at 325, the High Court has expressed a diminished willingness to apply the proviso. Indeed, the proviso may only be safely applied where the conviction is inevitable. Accordingly, the convictions must necessarily be quashed. 
      
       
        
       Ground Eleven. 
        
       
     51 That being so, the sole remaining question for this Court is whether ground 11 should be upheld. This ground is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “The verdicts were unreasonable, and/or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     52 The appellant submits that if this ground is upheld a verdict of acquittal should be entered in respect of all counts. 
      
       
     53 At the outset of the hearing of the appeal, an application was made by senior counsel for the appellant that the Court receive, what was categorised as fresh evidence, regarding Michael Heatley. 
      
       
     54 Ultimately, the Court agreed to admit the material, being three psychiatric reports, as Exhibit A in the appeal. The Court reserved, however, the question of the ultimate ambit of the relevance of the material. 
      
       
     55 By way of background, the Court was informed that on 29 January 2001, his Honour Judge Shillington DCJ found Michael Heatley not guilty of three counts of armed robbery, which offences occurred after the trial in the instant matter, on the grounds of mental illness, and remanded him in custody pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, 1990.  
      
       
     56 It appears that the mental illness disclosed in those proceedings was schizophrenia and/or other bi-polar disorder, dating back for a number of years, and prior to the death of his father Paul.  
      
       
     57 The additional evidence, as we shall call it, consisted of a report dated 10 March 2000 of Dr Rosalie Wilcox, general and forensic psychiatrist, which was obtained by the solicitors for Michael Heatley; the report dated 12 July 2000 of Dr William E. Lucas, psychiatrist, which was also obtained on behalf of the defence and the report of Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, dated 22 January 2001 which was obtained on behalf of the Crown. 
      
       
     58 Dr Wilcox, who was the treating psychiatrist, made a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia with a history of several years of auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions. She thought that a differential diagnosis was a schizoaffective disorder as Michael has had periods of mood elevation and depression that have not been associated with paranoia. 
      
       
     59 Dr Wilcox said that Michael has a mental illness which will require long term treatment. She was of the view that at the time of the armed robberies, to which he pleaded guilty, he was suffering from a disease of the mind and, although he would have been aware of the physical nature and quality of his actions, it is probable that he was unable to reason with a moderate degree of sense and composure about the wrongness of his actions. 
      
       
     60 Dr Lucas found on the history and the information available to him that it was probable that Michael suffers from chronic paranoid schizophrenia, another possibility being schizoaffective psychosis which would take into account the variations in mood he reported.  
      
       
     61 Dr Westmore concurred with the opinions expressed by Drs Wilcox and Lucas that Michael is suffering from a mental illness which was, on the history available, present at the time the armed robberies occurred. 
      
       
     62 Dr Westmore’s provisional diagnosis differed from that offered by Drs Wilcox and Lucas in that he believed that Michael has a bi-polar affective disorder with psychotic features. This condition may have been aggravated in the past when Michael misused illicit substances such as cannabis and amphetamines.  
      
       
     63 On the history available to Dr Westmore, Michael was acutely mentally ill at the time the offending behaviour occurred and there appeared to be a direct and positive relationship between his psychotic thought processes and the offending behaviour. He required, in Dr Westmore’s view, long term psychiatric support and supervision. 
      
       
     64 Counsel for the appellant submitted to this Court that if that additional evidence had been available in 1997 at the time of the appellant’s trial it should have: 
      
       
     · Had an impact upon the decision of the Crown as to whether Michael Heatley should be called at all;· Had an impact upon whether the trial judge ought to grant leave under s 38 to cross-examine Michael Heatley;· Had an impact upon the ambit of cross-examination permitted to the Crown; and· Had an impact upon the trial judge’s treatment of the witness and his evidence. 
      
       
     65 This additional evidence does establish that Michael Heatley could well have been suffering from a serious psychiatric illness at the time he gave evidence in the subject trial. 
      
       
     66 It is appropriate, therefore, to take the additional evidence into account when considering this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     67 The Crown contends (and counsel for the appellant denies) that absent the evidence of Michael Heatley, Christine Heatley and Roger Bissett, the remainder of the Crown case was sufficiently strong to justify a reasonable jury convicting the appellant. 
      
       
     68 It is appropriate, therefore, to consider in a summary form the main evidence upon which the Crown relies in support of this submission. 
      
       
        
       Evidence of Marie Jane Clarke 
        
       
     69 Ms Marie Clarke gave evidence that she was living at 7 Wayland Avenue as at 1 October 1994 with the persons to whom we have already made reference. She had resided there for about nine months and Paul had been living there for about eight weeks, having been released from gaol on 24 August 1994. Prior to being released, he had been coming home at weekends on work release. The appellant had been living at the house for only a few weeks, having been released from gaol after serving a lengthy sentence. 
      
       
     70 Ms Clarke was about eight months pregnant as a result of her relationship with Paul as at 1 October 1994.  
      
       
     71 As to the events of 1 October 1994, Ms Clarke deposed that she was awoken about 9 am by the appellant who had previously taken (without her knowledge) the keys to her car. He had brought the car back to the house about 8 am in a damaged condition, and this caused a confrontation between them.  
      
       
     72 Between about 11 am and noon she saw two men in the backyard whom she did not recognise. They were “maybe Lebanese, Turkish, Maltese of that nationality”. The appellant and Paul were speaking with the two men (T105.55; 106.50). 
      
       
     73 Shortly thereafter Paul came into the house and informed Marie that he was going off and would be back in a couple of hours.  
      
       
     74 Marie then saw the appellant and Paul leaving the house with the two men to whom she had referred in a white van. Paul was in the driver’s seat and the appellant was sitting in the passenger seat. The witness assumed that the two other men had entered the rear of the van, because she remembers the back sliding door opening (T107). 
      
       
     75 At about 4 pm Marie was in the backyard when the appellant arrived. He asked her to come inside the house, saying he had something to tell her. She said to him “Just tell me what’s happened Earl”. After telling her to sit down which she refused to do, the appellant said, “There has been an accident, Ned has been shot dead”.  
      
       
     76 Marie asked him “Why didn’t you bring him home?”. The appellant replied, “I tried to but he was too heavy”. The appellant then said, “I went to shoot and I accidentally got Ned, so I put a few through the other fellow” (T109). 
      
       
     77 Marie continued her evidence as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Oh he said something like, there had been a noise down the corridor so he had left Ned to tie the old man up and he has gone down to investigate the noise and there was a cleaner type man there and he has brought him back to the office and he has come back he and the owner were having a big struggle and Paul has come around and said, ‘Shoot him, shoot him, and Earl shot’ – I am not sure if he said it missed the other man or if he said that it went through, the bullet went through the other man into Paul.” 
         
        
       
     78 Marie said that during this conversation the appellant “appeared to be as quite agitated, quite paranoid” (T110).  
      
       
     79 Michael Heatley had been present during the conversation which occurred in the lounge room (T110). 
      
       
     80 The witness said that Michael was not “handling it well”; so she thought it best to get Michael over to his sister’s for support. This was a reference to Christine’s apartment at Bondi. 
      
       
     81 The appellant asked the witness to give him all the money in the house. After emptying the children’s money boxes there was about twenty to thirty dollars in change available, which she gave to him. (T110-111) 
      
       
     82 Prior to leaving the home Marie said to the appellant, “The police are going to come around and see what is going on. What do I do?”. The appellant replied, “Just say Michael and him were out all day and that I got a phone call around four o’clock saying – a tip-off type of thing, saying that Ned had been injured” (T112). 
      
       
     83 The appellant then left in Marie’s car, taking Michael with him to the Bondi apartment (T113). 
      
       
     84 About 1 am on the following morning, Sunday 2 October, the appellant returned. Marie was still in the lounge room, too nervous to sleep. The appellant told her that he had returned to get his car and go fishing. She observed the appellant arranging his fishing gear and putting it in the boot of his car. Before he left in the car the witness saw him take used tissues out of Marie’s car and throw them into a bin. This visit occupied about fifteen or twenty minutes (T114-115).  
      
       
     85 About 5 am to 6 am that morning, police officers arrived at the house (T115). 
      
       
     86 By this time, Michael had returned to the house and Marie, Michael and Melissa were taken in police cars to Flemington Police Station.  
      
       
     87 Marie stated that, when interviewed by the police on 2 October, she gave a false statement. She made no reference to the alleged admissions by the appellant. She said that on 1 October the appellant had gone out, and that she had received a phone call at about 4 pm to say that something had happened to him (T116). 
      
       
     88 Marie said that she had seen the appellant virtually every day thereafter until his arrest on 6 October, but the only occasion when she and the appellant had again spoken about the incident, was when the appellant apologised to her because she had lost her husband and the children had lost their dad. She said that she did not want to discuss the matter with the appellant. At one stage she told the appellant that he was looking very paranoid but he replied “Oh, they will just put it down to the grief of losing my brother” (T118). 
      
       
     89 On one occasion prior to the appellant’s arrest, Marie informed the appellant that she would like to go out and see Tony (Grub) who was in gaol and tell him what has happened. The appellant replied that he would come out with her. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I want to come out and see him too and let him know it was an accident.“ (T119) 
         
        
       
     90 Shortly after the appellant’s arrest Marie visited him in gaol. She told him that she had now told the police the truth. The witness was asked whether there was any reference by the appellant to a solicitor. She replied: 
      
       
        
         
         “Yes, he told me to go – he would ring me that night to go and see his solicitor and tell them that I wanted to draw back or pull back my statements.” (T121-122) 
         
        
       
     91 Marie was then asked, “Did he say anything about Paul’s children?”. She said that the appellant remarked, “That is what they were doing, seeing his solicitor and they were in the process of drawing back or pulling back their statements and that is the best thing I could do” (T122). 
      
       
     92 (By this stage the children had made statements to the police implicating the appellant.) 
      
       
     93 In chief the witness identified the knife that had been taken from the back of the van located near the factory (Exhibit O). She identified it as having come from her kitchen. She had last seen it a few days before 1 October (T127). 
      
       
     94 Ms Clarke’s cross-examination extended over 100 pages of transcript. The majority of the cross-examination was directed to matters of credit associated with her prior criminal record, past addiction to heroin and various nervous breakdowns which had required psychiatric treatment. However, she dealt resolutely with all the persistent challenges to the veracity of her evidence and made no concessions as to the accuracy of her account of the alleged admissions which the appellant had made to her. 
      
       
        
       Evidence of Karyn Heatley 
        
       
     95 In September and October 1994 Karyn Heatley was residing with Roger Bissett in their home at Lethbridge Park.  
      
       
     96 She deposed (after refreshing her memory from her statement without objection) that on the afternoon of 1 October outside 7 Wayland Avenue, Lidcombe, she had a conversation in the presence of Roger Bissett, the appellant and Michael. Michael told her that Paul had been shot.  
      
       
     97 The appellant responded: 
      
       
        
         
         “I shot him, he bumped the gun, it went straight through your father’s heart.” 
         
        
        
         
         “We tied this bloke up, I was watching him, the next thing I looked up and this cunt had your father around the throat.” 
         
        
       
     98 Karyn deposed that as the appellant said this, he placed his hands around his throat. The appellant then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Dad said, very hoarsely, ‘Shoot him, shoot him’, so I shot and as I shot the bloke who had hold of him, turned and it went straight through your father’s heart. … The bloke lunged at him like a football player and that, knocked the gun up and that’s how your Dad got shot. 
         
        
        
         
         But don’t worry, I shot the cunt in the head, I shot two of them in the head and the bloke that lunged at me, I kicked him in the face because he laid there crying like a dog, I put four bullets into his head.” (T383-384) 
         
        
       
     99 Karyn further deposed that the group travelled to the apartment at Bondi and there, after the appellant was asked by Christine to describe what happened, the appellant said that Paul had the man in a headlock. He had shot him after Paul had asked him to. He had said that they had been looking for a balaclava but Paul couldn’t find one. 
      
       
     100 Because of its importance we set out the following passage from Karyn’s evidence in chief. At this stage the witness by leave (and still without objection) was referring to the written statement that she had made to the police: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Do you see par 8? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You told the police what had occurred after the accused and Michael had arrived at the Bondi flat, is that right? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Christine said something? 
          
         A. Yes, Christine said, ‘What happened?’ And Earl said, “Dad had the man in a headlock. Dad said to me to shoot him. I shot him the bullet passed through Dad’s biceps and straight through the man’s head and straight through your father. There was a lot more conversation and Earl gibbered on for quite some time, about 20 minutes or more. I cannot remember the exact words used by Earl, but he said words similar to, ‘Right, it’s like this, we’re looking for a balaclava, trying to buy a balaclava, do you think Neddy could find a balaclava, we were driving around everywhere.’ I interrupted and said, ‘Earl, it’s not a book, I don’t want to know all this shit. I just want to know about the shot.’ Earl said, ‘Right, I’ve had the gun, we’ve gone in, tied a bloke up. I said, “No, Ned, do it this way”, and tied his arms behind his back, put duct tape across his eyes and I’m covering him. Ned’s gone out the back.’ I interrupted him again --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You interrupted him and 
          
         A. And said, ‘you had to think you were a cowboy. I won’t say it again, it’s not a fucking book, just get to the point.’ Earl goes, ‘Right, I’ve looked around and this cunt has got Neddy around the throat. Neddy’s gone shoot him, so I shot him, he’s moved and the bullet’s hit your father. As I went to fire the gun this joker on the ground has tackled me’. I can’t remember the exact words he used next but he said something like, ‘That’s when I pumped bullets into their heads and kicked that cunt in the face.’ 
         
        
        
         
         At some stage during this conversation Earl said, ‘I was holding your Dad, he turned grey in my arms and he said, “piss off”. Your Dad was alive when I left.’ During this conversation Earl sat at the dining table on a velour type of fabric chair. He was wearing a light coloured cotton shirt and today, just thinking back I cannot remember seeing any blood on his shirt and if his story was that he held my Dad in his arms, surely there would have been some blood on his shirt. He was also wearing grey blue flannel slacks. He had a navy blue pair of runners, made of nylon and suede. I do remember that Earl said, ‘See the blood, that’s where I kicked the cunt in the face.’ When he said this he pointed to his runners and I could see what appeared to be blood on the instep of one of his runners. I only glanced at this because I don’t like the sight of blood as it makes me sick.” (T384-385) 
         
        
       
     101 Karyn’s evidence continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Do you see [paragraph 9 about one third of the page from the bottom, ‘On the news they stated’, do you see that? 
          
         A. Yes. ‘On the news they stated two people were dead from head wounds, one man was in hospital with a wound to his left biceps. I asked Earl, “Was Dad a head shot”’, Earl replied, “No.” I said, “Did you shoot anyone else in the arm?” Earl said, “Well I’m not sure.” Then he said, “No.” I said, “So that could be Dad in hospital”. He said, “Yes.” And something else but I can’t remember exactly what that was but it may have been “I hope so”. After watching the news and of what Earl had told all of us I honestly believe there was some hope that my Dad was still alive. Christine and I then went to the phone box behind her flat in Edwards St and there Christine rang Hornsby Hospital and asked -” 
         
        
        
         
         Q. There was a conversation about whether your father was in hospital, whether he was a survivor from the shooting? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you go off to the flat after the phone call? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         What happened after that? 
          
         A. We went to the hospital.” (T386) 
         
        
       
     102 And further: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Do you see paragraph 11? 
          
         A. ‘When we got back to the flat we said to everyone “let’s go to the hospital”. Earl then said, “I need a shower and a change of clothes”. I then said, “Stuff that Earl we haven’t got time”. But Earl insisted, Earl said, “I need something to get rid of the powder burns”. So he took the cleaning agents from the kitchen to scrub his arms, one was the new Pine-O-Clean and the other was the pump spray Jiff. He took them into the bathroom and had his shower. He was in the shower for about fifteen minutes and when he finished he said, “I scrubbed my whole body”. I could see that his arm was almost red raw. When he said this he was already dressed in a water melon coloured T shirt with a logo that read, “One Eyed Jacks Worm Farm Slimy Wheat Eat”. This T shirt I gave him for Christmas last year and over the top of that he wore a red check flannelette shirt. His pants were grey slacks and this clothing that he put on he brought up with him when he arrived. He then asked, “Chrissie have you got some skin lotion?” I said, “There’s Nivea in there”. At this time he was out of the bathroom and standing in the lounge room. I can’t remember who got him the Nivea but once he got it he rubbed it over his hands and arms and on his face and all through his hair. 
         
        
        
         
         (12) He then asked, “I need some bags to put my clothes in?” Someone got him white plastic shopping bags, into one of the bags went the shoes, into the other bags went the clothes he was wearing when he arrived that is mentioned above and pair of yellow dish washing gloves. Earl asked, “Can I have some more bags?” I went and got him two more bags and gave them to him and he put one each over the other bags. I can’t remember what happened to the clothes, as I can only remember them being on the kitchen table after I had given Earl the extra bags. All of us then left for the hospital, this being Earl, Michael, Christine, Maher, Roger and myself’.” (T387) 
         
        
       
     103 The group then went to the hospital and having made some enquiries they returned to the apartment at Bondi.  
      
       
     104 Karyn deposed that after they returned to the apartment, she had the following conversation with the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         “A. Yes. (paragraph 15) I asked Earl, ‘Where did you leave Dad’. He replied, ‘Outside’. I said, ‘Was Dad the only one outside?’ Earl said, ‘Yes’. I was then convinced that it was my father alive in Hornsby Hospital. Earl decided to clean the car out, he told us, there was brains (sic) all through it.’ By this stage Earl was extremely paranoid. He took the dirty towel from the bathroom floor to clean the car out with, Michael, Roger, Maher and myself went downstairs with him to the carport under the unit in car space number 13. However Roger and Maher went back up. Michael and I stayed there. Anyway there was a conversation about microphones and policeman looking at him? 
          
         A. Yes, as I said before, I don’t remember anything about microphones but I do remember that someone looked out the window and Earl made a comment about there being police or something like that because there are just all flats everywhere. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see the accused Earl Heatley clean the car with a towel? 
          
         A. Yes, I saw him wipe over the door with a towel. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you say something to him about fishing? 
          
         A. Yes, I suggested that maybe he should go fishing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you remember what you said to him, see in your statement what you are reported as saying about halfway down the page? 
          
         A. Earl then got in the driver’s seat and proceeded to clean the car with a towel. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you see about halfway down page 7? 
          
         A. ‘Earl, I have an idea, you should go fishing to calm down and plus the police may come here so’ll (sic) you be gone’. He said, ‘Yeah, I’ll do that, it’s a good night to go fishing’. Maher then came back downstairs and I asked Maher, ‘Do you have any fishing gear?’ Maher said, “yes”. I then said, “Good because Earl is going to go fishing’. Earl then asked Maher, “Where can I buy some bait from?’ Michael said, ‘Try a servo’. Earl then got into the back seat of the car and started cleaning around there. It was getting late so Roger and I left understanding that Earl was to go fishing’. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why did you suggest to him to go fishing, do you remember? 
          
         A. Well, I just would have wanted him gone from us.” (T389) 
         
        
       
     105 Karyn was also cross-examined at length. Her cross-examination extending for some 65 pages.  
      
       
     106 Karyn conceded in cross-examination that at the first trial (in which the jury was discharged) she had falsely stated before the jury that the statements which she made to the police implicating the appellant were false. When asked why she had lied in the earlier trial, the witness replied: 
      
       
        
         
         “I can’t remember the points of conversation. He [meaning the appellant] denied telling them; Roger said he didn’t hear a conversation; Christine won’t talk about it and Michael said he didn’t hear a confession. When I went to see him [referring to the appellant] he said, ‘I didn’t say anything like that to you’.” (T398) 
         
        
       
     107 Purely for the sake of completion, we refer briefly to the evidence of Roger Bissett, Michael Heatley and Christine Heatley. As we have already made clear, the evidence of these witnesses is to be disregarded for the purpose of ground 11. 
      
       
        
       Evidence of Roger Bissett 
        
       
     108 In evidence in chief Roger Bissett did not give any particularly significant evidence in relation to the discussions which took place after he and Karyn arrived at Lidcombe at about 4.30 pm on 1 October. 
      
       
     109 He gave evidence that he and Karyn returned to the Bondi apartment at about 5.30 to 6 pm (T313). At the apartment Karyn had spoken with Christine who had become extremely upset (T314). He had seen Michael and the appellant enter the flat about thirty to forty minutes after he and Karyn arrived. There was an ABC news bulletin in which there was a report about a bungled robbery which was shown after the appellant had arrived. He said that after the appellant and Michael arrived there was “just madness”. People began asking questions and shouting questions as to what had happened. There was “complete mayhem”. He said that he could not remember the full conversations that occurred, but he thought the appellant had said something about Neddy being held by the neck and something about a pistol (T314). He thought that the appellant had said “I had this 9 mm pistol” and something about a “hair trigger” (T315).  
      
       
     110 Having given this evidence the witness claimed that the remainder of his statement to the police was incorrect. His Honour granted the Crown leave to cross-examine him and thereafter evidence was led from him. 
      
       
     111 The witness claimed that he had been recounting in his statement what Karyn had told him and had only heard snippets of the conversation. He said that when he was talking the appellant had appeared distressed. Further, that after the news report that one of the people involved in the incident had been shot in the arm, the group decided to go and check that out at the hospital (T323). 
      
       
     112 The witness said that he remembered the appellant having a shower and scrubbing himself and rubbing on moisturiser. Also he recalls the appellant packing his dirty clothes in shopping bags and placing them in the back of the car before they left to go to the hospital (T325).  
      
       
     113 The witness deposed that at the hospital, the group received very vague information as to who was there. He thought they had been told that it was not Paul Heatley and they were still unsure. After they had gone back to Bondi, it had been decided that Karyn and he would try and determine the next day whether Paul Heatley was dead or not (T326).  
      
       
     114 At the apartment, the witness deposed that he remembered the appellant saying “You guys will think I’m a bastard”, or words to that effect. The witness also said something like “You’ll resent me for the rest of your lives” (T327). 
      
       
     115 The witness and Karen returned to Lethbridge Park, but before doing so, the witness deposed that he had seen the appellant cleaning the inside of the Falcon motor vehicle. He was removing rubbish and cleaning the dashboard, the steering wheel and the seats with some substance. He had been generally cleaning the vehicle (T327). 
      
       
        
       Evidence of Michael Heatley 
        
       
     116 In evidence in chief Michael Heatley deposed that he went to Wayland Avenue on 1 October. During the course of the morning he had seen four or five men talking among themselves and with his father. The appellant had not spoken with them other than perhaps to say “Hi”. He said that he did not see the men leave the house (T464, 467). 
      
       
     117 Thereafter he and the appellant had gone out and were away for about twenty minutes. They had placed bets at the TAB. When they returned, he saw a white van parked in the driveway.  
      
       
     118 Thereafter the witness was referred to his statement and he asserted that what he had said in that statement (which contained significant evidence implicating the appellant) was untrue or, alternatively, he was relating information that had been supplied to him by others apart from the appellant. He also said that he was fearful of the police.  
      
       
     119 During cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor (by leave) the witness did assert that after he and the appellant returned to Wayland Avenue and noticed the van they changed the oil and water and “Earl might have gone for a drive to show my father the gears on the car and then that’s when my father came back. He asked me would I go for a drive with Earl. This was close to twelve o’clock (T475).  
      
       
        
       Evidence of Christine Heatley 
        
       
     120 Christine Heatley’s evidence may be completely disregarded. She denied any recollection of events on or after 1 October 1994 in relation to the armed robbery. She also denied any recollection of having made a statement to police officers and the contents thereof. 
      
       
     121 In the event that there is a new trial, it will be solely a matter for the Crown Prosecutor whether he or she calls all or any of the last mentioned three witnesses. We would not presume to predict what attitude the trial judge would take to any application the Crown might make to cross-examine any of these persons if they were called. These are matters which have no relevance to the resolution of ground 11, because as we have indicated, we are concerned with the strength of the Crown case without the evidence of these persons. It is not necessary, therefore, to deal with submissions by counsel regarding the probative value (or lack of it) of any evidence that these three persons might give in a fresh trial. 
      
       
     122 For the purposes of ground 11, the Crown also relies upon the following evidence. 
      
       
        
       Statements made by the appellant to police officers. 
        
       
     123 Detective Sergeant Jacob gave evidence that he was the officer in charge of the investigation. He had available to him on the evening of 6 October 1994, statements from Michael, Karyn and Roger and Maher Abadlla, all dated 6 October, which implicated the appellant in the murder of Paul. 
      
       
     124 Detective Jacob and other police officers interviewed the appellant at the Lidcombe Police Station on the evening of 6 October. 
      
       
     125 When first asked by the witness whether he knew anything about the death of Paul, the appellant replied that he knew nothing about it. He was then handed, and asked to read each of the abovementioned statements. 
      
       
     126 Thereafter, Detective Jacob gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “About 10.47 pm Det Richardson and I returned to the interview room where I saw the accused slowly rocking in his chair. I said, ‘Have you read those documents?’ The accused slowly nodded his head and he said, ‘Look, you don’t understand. You look at the evidence (the accused pointed to the statements). I’m going to gaol for the rest of my life, I’ll die there. It doesn’t matter whether it was an accident or not, I know I’ll be going to gaol for the rest of my life’.” (T763) 
         
        
       
     127 The appellant then declined to answer any further questions until he had spoken to a solicitor. A solicitor could not be contacted. 
      
       
     128 However, prior to the termination of the interview the appellant said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I also told you that I didn’t shoot Paul, I just didn’t shoot anybody.” (T764) 
         
        
       
     129 Detective Sergeant Dowding gave evidence, relevantly, to the following effect: 
      
       
        
         
         “About 10.45 am on 7 October 1994 with Detective Senior Sergeant Wright and Det Constable King I went to the cell complex of the Burwood Local Court. I had a conversation with a corrective services officer. I was then directed to an interview room in the complex. 
         
        
        
         
         I then saw the accused, Earl Heatley, enter the interview room. Detective King said, ‘Giddaymate, I’m Detective King, this is Detective Sergeant Wright and Dowding. We’re the investigating (sic) the matter from last night. Have you seen your solicitors?’ The accused said, ‘Yes, look if you had got me a solicitor last night I would have sung and told you the lot, if I had a solicitor.’ 
         
        
        
         
         I said to the accused, ‘It wasn’t for the want of trying. We tried for half an hour or so, no one would come out’. The accused said, ‘I’m just telling you I didn’t shoot at me brother’.” (T855) 
         
        
        
       Evidence of telephone intercepts. 
        
       
     130 The Crown also relies upon the following evidence of telephone intercepts. 
      
       
     131 On 10 October 1994 a telephone call from the appellant (then in the Remand Centre) to Marie was intercepted. 
      
       
     132 The content of that telephone message contains, the Crown contends, significant (though somewhat veiled) admissions by the appellant. The transcript was tendered at the trial and became Exhibit BB.  
      
       
     133 Because of its importance we will quote the exhibit in full:

         V1: 
          Yeah. I think what’s happened Earl is that their heads have been poisoned.

         V1: And they want – and she wanted to call into Roger’s as well. So that’s alright for them to take that Earl? 
         
        
        
         
         V3: Yeah yeah ‘course it is. (Can’t decipher) 
         
        
        
         
         V1: But can I tell you one thing? 
         
        
        
         
         V3: What? 
         
        
        
         
         V1: That it’s your car okay and it’s your decision and they’re gonna ask you what you want done with it.

         V1: Don’t let the kids get it. 
         
        
        
         
         V3: No I won’t. 
         
        
        
         
         V1: Earl, please. 
         
        
        
         
         V3: Yeah well I won’t.

         V1:

         V3: Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         V1: I’m sorry to say. 
         
        
        
         
         V3: Yeah well ..

         V3: .. I can’t tell, I can’t, I can’t prove any different to them. 
         
        
        
         
         V1: I know, (can’t decipher) no. Is there anything I can do for ya? 
         
        
        
         
         V3: No, nothing. 
         
        
        
         
         V1: Has – your solicitor that came and saw you today? 
         
        
        
         
         V3: Yeah they’re comin’ back tomorrow. 
         
        
        
         
         V1: Well one of um, Ned’s friends .. 
         
        
        
         
         V3: Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         V1: .. and that, he had that solicitor and he put him on to us. He rang him for us.

         [The emphasis is ours.] 
         
        
        
       Some aspects of the circumstantial evidence specifically relied on by the Crown. 
        
       
     140 Mr Scott said that at the factory Mr Thompson had grabbed the intruder, who was obviously Paul Heatley, by the neck and struggled with him, whereupon Paul Heatley had shouted to the other intruder “Shoot him” more than once and Karyn Heatley said that the appellant had said that the bloke had Paul by the throat and that Paul had said “Shoot him, shoot him” (T110). 
      
       
     141 Further, Marie Clarke testified to the appellant saying to her that at the scene Paul Heatley had said “Shoot him, shoot him”.  
      
       
     142 White adhesive tape was located at the scene of the crime with what appeared to be grey coloured hair (Mr Thompson had grey hair) stuck to the tape (T63) (T69) and a roll of such tape was found in the pocket of Paul Heatley (T69). The appellant was seen by Marie Clarke departing with Paul Heatley, who obviously had a roll of white adhesive tape. Karyn Heatley said that the appellant had stated at the Bondi apartment that they had “tied a bloke up ... put duct tape across his eyes” (T384).  
      
       
     143 Black plastic tie clips were found in the factory office (T69) and also at 7 Wayland Avenue when police executed the second search warrant (T57). Such ties were also found in the front of Paul Heatley’s jeans (T69). 
      
       
     144 Peter Elliott, an eyewitness to the aftermath of the murders, deposed that he had seen the intruder lying on the ground move and raise his head after the other person had left (T44). This means that Paul Heatley was alive when the other person had left. Karyn said that the appellant had told her that Paul was alive when he left him at the factory (T385).  
      
       
     145 At the Bondi apartment, the appellant had given himself a most thorough shower. Karyn said that the appellant mentioned the need “to get rid of powder burns”. He then had a shower. Afterwards the appellant was seen placing his clothes and shoes in plastic bags (T387).  
      
       
     146 The appellant was seen cleaning out the car in which he had returned to the house at Lidcombe at about 4 pm (T115).  
      
       
     147 The visit to Hornsby hospital by the family group including the appellant, being anxious as to the fate of Paul Heatley is relevant evidence. At that stage, the Crown contends, the group would not have known of Paul’s fate, unless they had been advised by the appellant of his participation in the events at the factory.  
      
       
     148 The Crown contends that the statements made by the appellant to police indicate knowledge by the appellant of the killings and of a concern for it to be understood that the shooting of Paul was an accident. 
      
       
     149 The statements on the listening device recordings indicate, the Crown contends, a desire by the appellant to indicate to Paul’s family that the shootings were not premeditated but unintentional.  
      
       
     150 Karyn deposed that the appellant told her that he kicked Mr Thompson in the face because he “laid there crying like a dog” (T384). Dr Ellis gave evidence that he located an abrasion about 3.8 cms long and 2.8 cms wide on top of Mr Thompson’s scalp, which could have been caused by a kick (T203-204). There was also another abrasion on the left cheek (T203). 
      
       
        
       Sufficiency of the evidence. 
        
       
     151 In the events which have happened, the first question for this Court is whether, leaving aside the impugned evidence, there was sufficient evidence upon which the jury could have been satisfied of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In other words, would a reasonable jury necessarily have had a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt based upon the available evidence independent of the impugned evidence.  
      
       
     152 If this issue is resolved in favour of the appellant, then no question of a new trial arises.  
      
       
     153 If, on the other hand, the question is resolved in favour of the Crown then the question for the Court is whether, having regard to all the circumstances, the miscarriage of justice associated with the quashing of the convictions, can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the Court is empowered to make: see s 8 Criminal Appeal Act 1912, as amended. 
      
       
     154 We turn then to what was described as the unsafe and unsatisfactory ground. In R v Benecke [1999] NSWCCA 163, Barr J stated (with the concurrence of Abadee and Ireland JJ) at par 26: 
      
       
        
         
         “Although it has been convenient in times past to use a formulation which asserts that a conviction is ‘unsafe and unsatisfactory’ that term is imprecise and it is necessary to have regard to the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. By s 6(1) the Court in any appeal under s 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that the  
         verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, 
          or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     155 Benecke has similarities to the instant case. This Court determined in Benecke that the learned trial judge had incorrectly admitted evidence led by the Crown as to the behaviour of a tracker dog.  
      
       
     156 The Court then considered the evidence available to the Crown independently of the rejected tracker dog evidence, and rejected the argument that the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence, or that there was any miscarriage of justice. Thus their Honours quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. 
      
       
     157 As we have already indicated, in view of the seriousness of the subject offences, it is appropriate to assume in favour of the appellant that Michael Heatley’s long standing psychiatric condition may have rendered his evidence unreliable. Therefore it will not be considered in determining whether the first ground of appeal has been made out. Further, the evidence of Christine Heatley and Roger Bissett should be disregarded in its entirety.  
      
       
     158 With respect to ground of appeal 11, the Court has the benefit of detailed written submissions by senior counsel for the appellant directed to alleged weaknesses in the evidence which the Crown seeks to rely upon to justify an order for a new trial. 
      
       
     159 Particular reliance was placed upon the fact that Marie had been a heroin addict until age twenty-one and was thereafter on a methadone programme to which she became addicted. She has suffered from severe depression since the age of twenty-six and has suffered from five breakdowns, three of which she described as severe. She has been hospitalised at times in psychiatric clinics. The witness was medicated with anti-depressants at the time of giving evidence. The evidence with respect to these matters was amplified in the submissions.  
      
       
     160 Marie had on her own account made a detailed, but untrue statement to the police on 2 October 1994, for the purpose of their investigation into the death of her de facto husband. Albeit, it was argued that statement contained many true details as to personal information.  
      
       
     161 The submission referred in detail to material raised in the lengthy cross-examination of the witness at the trial before McInerney J. 
      
       
     162 There is no doubt that there was copious subjective and objective material upon which Marie Clarke was cross-examined. However, in our assessment, it was open to the jury in the light of other admissible and reliable evidence to accept her version of the relevant facts and the admissions which she alleges the appellant made to her. 
      
       
     163 With regard to the evidence of Karyn Heatley it was submitted that although there was no application under s 38 of the Evidence Act to treat her as an unfavourable witness, and the evidence was given without objection, it was no more than a recitation of what she had said out of court to the police. She endorsed the contents of the statements not because she remembered the facts asserted having occurred, but because she described herself to be a truthful person with no reason to have lied to the police. 
      
       
     164 With regard to this submission, the following passages from Karyn’s cross-examination should be noted. It was put to her: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. No doubt the police were keen to have your signature on something. Did they say they wanted you to sign a new statement? 
          
         A. Yes, I had to sign where I wrote. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But basically what you said in your statement of 6 October was true, is that right? 
          
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
     165 Shortly thereafter: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Wait, will you? Is what you are telling the jury today that the accused made those confessions to you, is that right? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. All of them are true? 
          
         A. Yes, to my belief they are true.” (T396-397) 
         
        
       
     166 The admissibility of the evidence given by Karyn is, therefore, not struck down by Lee’s case. In Lee, evidence was admitted at the trial of out of court statements made by a witness which included a report of a confession made by the appellant to that witness. The evidence of these out of court statements was given because the witness gave evidence at the trial denying (or at least not admitting) that she had heard the appellant make the confessional statements. Clearly, therefore, Lee’s case has no relevance to the probative value of Karyn’s evidence of the admissions which she states the appellant made to her. 
      
       
     167 Karyn asserted in evidence that what she was recorded in the statement as having told the police was in fact the truth. In other words that the appellant had in fact confessed to her. 
      
       
     168 In Driscoll v The Queen  (1977) 137 CLR 517 at 541, Gibbs J said that a record could be used to refresh the memory of any person who prepared it or supervised its preparation or read it while the facts were fresh in that person’s memory. The relevant principles are discussed in “Cross on Evidence” at pars [17180] and [17200]: see also s 32 of the Sentencing Act, 1995.  
      
       
     169 In our view the evidence given by Karyn Heatley was adduced in an admissible form. 
      
       
     170 As to the eyewitness accounts relied upon by the Crown, most importantly Thomas Bithel, it was argued they do not take the Crown case against the appellant any further than the fact that Paul Heatley and at least another were involved in a criminal activity which resulted in the deaths and wounding. On Mr Bithel’s evidence, it was submitted, Paul Heatley (or whoever was struggling with Mr Thompson) was not shot in the vestibule area in which the witness and Mr Thompson were shot by the masked gunman (an account not inconsistent with the ballistics evidence adduced by the Crown), be that masked gunman Paul Heatley or someone else. Further, the green rubber gloves found on the body of Paul Heatley were not “rubber gloves that the unmasked man had been wearing”, as the Crown alleged, but on Mr Bithel’s evidence, were “like them” (insofar as they were rubber gloves or “washing up” gloves), and his best recollection (stated in evidence to be the account provided on the day to the police) was that both the masked and unmasked offenders had been wearing rubber gloves. 
      
       
     171 These are, of course, illustrations of matters open to be raised by the appellant. However, their cogency is to be assessed in the light of the overall admissible evidence against the appellant.  
      
       
     172 The next point which is understandably made is that the forensic evidence called by the Crown, and supplemented by the defence witness Richard Collins, demonstrated that no bullet wound to either of the deceased men had first gone through the other or any intermediary. Further, the expert evidence did not support there having been any strangulation, throttling, or struggling in the nature of hands around the throat of the deceased, Paul Heatley. 
      
       
     173 Further detailed submissions were made on behalf of the appellant relating to the cogency of the Crown case. These submissions have all been carefully considered and evaluated.  
      
       
     174 Counsel for the appellant also seeks to rely upon the alibi evidence given by the appellant which, it is said, is supported by witnesses called by the Crown. The witnesses to whom reference is made include Wayne Backhouse, security manager of the Totalisator Agency Board of New South Wales and Gregory Fenwick who was at the relevant time the manager of the Lidcombe Hotel which contained a TAB. There was also evidence by Ian Lamont from the Berala TAB.  
      
       
     175 However, giving full weight to these submissions we are not satisfied that, to use the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, the verdicts of the jury should be set aside on the ground that they were unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence or that on any other ground there was a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, the appellant is not entitled to verdicts of acquittal. 
      
       
     176 That being so, the proper administration of justice and the public interest require that there be a new trial on all counts. 
      
       
     177 Accordingly, the orders of the court are: 
      
       
        
         
         1. Appeal allowed. 
          
         2. Convictions quashed. 
          
         3. There be a new trial on all counts.

      REGINA v. GERARD ALLAN SULLIVAN 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: Gerard Allan Sullivan seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court of New South Wales following his plea of guilty to the crime of armed robbery with an offensive weapon. That crime is punishable under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     2 The learned trial judge in his remarks on sentence referred to the particulars pleaded of the offence, that is, that on 2 March 2001 at Gosford the applicant, being then armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, did rob Melissa Eve Neilson of certain property, namely a backpack, key purse, silver necklace and a quantity of cash. 
      
       
     3 The trial judge found, having regard to the statement of facts tendered in evidence that what had occurred was, at about 8.10 pm on Friday 2 March 2001 Ms. Neilson was walking south on the eastern side of Mann Street, Gosford. When she reached a point in that street near the intersection of Racecourse Road and Mann Street she crossed over to the western side of the road. 
      
       
     4 A red Mitsubishi sedan was parked facing north in Mann Street. The offender got out of the car, approached her saying, “You wouldn’t know anywhere I could fucking get on?”. She attempted to walk around him but he seized her around the throat causing her silver necklace to break and fall to the ground. He produced a knife and held it to her throat saying “give me your fucking money”. He took hold of her handbag and pulled it from her shoulder and pushed her to the ground. She landed heavily on the ground causing immediate intense pain to her left elbow and right thigh. He then got into the car with the bag and drove off. She was assisted by two witnesses. 
      
       
     5 She identified him the following day and he was apprehended later that day. He gave a record of interview but did not make in that record of interview any admissions of being involved in the robbery. 
      
       
     6 Although the victim referred to the weapon as a knife, the applicant told a psychologist, and his Honour in evidence on the plea that what he used was, in fact, a screwdriver. 
      
       
     7 His Honour found that the experience was absolutely terrifying for the victim and referred to the applicant’s criminal record, which included a prison sentence of nine months for malicious wounding commencing on 26 August 1989. 
      
       
     8 The applicant gave evidence before the trial judge. He referred to having been drinking heavily on the occasion of the offence. His remark to the victim, “you wouldn’t know anywhere I could fucking get on”, seemed to indicate a concern with being able to find drugs. That accords with the applicant’s condition of drug induced psychosis as it was diagnosed to be by a psychologist whose opinion was in evidence. 
      
       
     9 The psychologist’s report refers to the applicant as being a follower who was under some considerable pressure from his girlfriend to get drugs or money to get drugs on that occasion. The learned trial judge apparently accepted the account given as indicating the background to the commission of the offence. 
      
       
     10 The trial judge sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for four years and six months commencing on 7 November 2001 and imposed in respect of that sentence a non-parole period of two years and nine months expiring on 6 August 2004. 
      
       
     11 On the application for leave to appeal there have been two principal matters advanced. These concern the trial judge’s treatment of two important matters, the first being the value attributed to the applicant’s plea of guilty; the second being the way in which his Honour had regard to the fact, not subject to any challenge, that whilst on bail and prior to sentence the applicant had spent just short of five months in full-time custodial rehabilitation with the WHOS (“We Help Ourselves”) programme. 
      
       
     12 The trial judge dealt with the question of the plea in a passage in his remarks on sentence in which he said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The offender did plead guilty, although not at the first opportunity, and he denied when spoken to by police that he was responsible for the offence. He did plead guilty, as I said earlier, on 31 August 2001. That may have been one of the first times he had received some legal assistance, so consequently he is entitled to a discount for that plea of guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         It is said that the discount can vary greatly but, as suggested by the courts that a range would be from 10% to 25%, in this case I think a range, proper discount, would be one of 10%.” 
         
        
       
     13 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the learned trial judge while finding that there had been a plea sufficiently early for it to be of some substantial utilitarian value, had afforded only such discount as is reserved for a case where a plea of guilty is made either on or very close to the date fixed for trial. 
      
       
     14 It was submitted that in effect the discount allowed by his Honour failed to have regard to the effective difference in the utilitarian benefits involved in a late plea and that made shortly after the receipt of legal advice and sufficiently in advance of a trial to enable the use of public resources to be considerably circumscribed. 
      
       
     15 It is apparent that his Honour did conclude in that sentence “that may have been one of the first times he had received some legal assistance, so consequently he is entitled to a discount for that plea of guilty”, that his Honour was minded to afford a discount for the plea, recognising that the accused pleaded at what was a reasonably early practical opportunity following the provision of legal advice. 
      
       
     16 I am unable to see how in those circumstances a discount so low as 10% might properly be given in accordance with that range of authorities, which have included Regina v. Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and Regina v. Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142. In my view his Honour has fallen into error having regard to the way in which he has treated the plea of guilty in this case. 
      
       
     17 As to the second ground of appeal, substantial oral argument was put in addition to the written argument that the court should recognise the utilitarian value of those particularly afflicted by drug addiction who are minded themselves to enter full-time custodial programmes of rehabilitation, which custodial programme contains an onerous element of confinement. 
      
       
     18 Our attention was drawn to Regina v. Marschall [2002] NSWCCA 197 and Regina v. Aiken [2001] NSWCCA 40 and the cases cited in those authorities as supporting the proposition that regard must be had in the eventual sentence passed for the time spent in such confinement, directed as it is to achieving the public estimable goal of rehabilitation as well as regard being had to it as evidencing a movement towards an attempt at rehabilitation as subjective to the individual offender. 
      
       
     19 Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 sets out a number of specific matters to which a court should have regard when sentencing. Both of those objectives to which I have referred are contemplated by various of the particular matters to which a court is required to have regard under s.21A. 
      
       
     20 In the present case the learned trial judge referred to that period of time that the applicant had spent in WHOS, and referred to the effect he considered that attendance at the programme might have, in a passage in his remarks on sentence.  
      
       
        
         
         “It is also a fact that the offender when obtaining bail after only two or three days in custody, did avail himself of an opportunity to go into WHOS and I have two reports, one dated 30 August and one dated 6 November which state that although there was one infraction it was not serious and that he has been doing very well whilst in WHOS' care. Indeed before this hearing commenced his counsel sought an adjournment until approximately March of next year so that the offender could complete the WHOS programme and indeed that application was renewed after I heard evidence from the offender. 
         
        
        
         
         The offender told me that he believes that he would be much better off serving a gaol sentence after he has completed the course being better able to face the rigours of the gaols system. 
         
        
        
         
         I feel that I cannot accede to the application to stand the matter over for that long. It would place intense pressure on the offender himself and was also, maybe that as the time got closer and realised that he was going to gaol that it might even put so much pressure he might take another course. Consequently I believe that it is best I deal the matter today."" 
         
        
       
     21 It is clear that what his Honour was concerned with at that point was the question of deferring the passing of sentence until a successful completion of the WHOS residential programme. His Honour at no point indicates that he is prepared to take into account the accused’s generally successful attempt to complete the program as affecting the quantum of sentence by reason of the accused having entered into the custodial rehabilitation option offered by that programme. 
      
       
     22 His Honour does have regard to the offender’s attempts at rehabilitation in considering subjective matters. Also his Honour recommends the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service with drug rehabilitation upon the appellant being released to parole. He refers to the appellant’s need for assistance when he comes out of gaol and in that regard concludes that that matter amounts to special circumstances entitling the offender to a longer than normal period on parole. But it does not seem to me that his Honour, even though the possibility was envisaged, it seems to me, at least implicitly, in his closing remarks, of the offender needing perhaps to go into further custodial rehabilitation, gave to the appellant on sentence that discount whether expressed mathematically or as a substantial component of the eventual synthesis to which the authorities would indicate he was entitled for that matter. 
      
       
     23 I conclude that in both respects his Honour fell into error to the extent that the sentencing exercise miscarried and that another sentence warranted in law should be passed. 
      
       
     24 It is desirable, it has been said in certain of the authorities, to refer to the extent to which the discount for a plea should be allowed. For my part, having regard to the Henry guideline, I would commence the sentencing exercise at the point the trial judge did, that is to say at the five year figure. I would be of the view that an appropriate allowance for the plea in the circumstances having regard to the Thomson & Houlton guideline would be of the order of 17½% and that for the period in rehabilitation there should be allowed a sufficient deduction so as to provide for a substantial sentence of four years and one month with a non-parole period of two years and three months. 
      
       
     25 The sentence should date from the date nominated by the trial judge, that being 7 November 2001. It will, therefore, expire some months earlier, that is on 6 December 2005. The non-parole period of two years and three months will expire on 6 February 2004. I reiterate the finding of special circumstances made by the trial judge. 
      
       
     26 The orders, therefore, I would propose are: that leave to appeal be granted; the appeal be upheld; the sentence and non-parole period imposed in the District Court be set aside; and that the applicant be re-sentenced to imprisonment as I have indicated. 
      
       
     27 SPERLING, J: I agree. The orders of the court will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPERLING, J: I will ask Greg James J to deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales in respect of an offence of aggravated sexual assault upon a male child under the age of 16 committed on l February 2001. That offence was in respect of a matter to which s.61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 refers which section provides for a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  
      
       
     3 On the occasion of sentencing the applicant in respect of the matter the learned trial judge dealt with the breach of a bond given under s.9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to the applicant to be of good behaviour for 18 months by another District Court Judge in respect of an offence of aggravated indecent assault which was committed on 8 July 1994 to which the applicant had pleaded guilty, and also dealt with the applicant in respect of a breach of a bond under s.12 of that Act, that bond having been entered into as a consideration of the suspension of a sentence of 12 months imposed on 8 December 2000 by that other District Court judge and conditioned that the appellant be of good behaviour. That bond was also imposed for an offence of aggravated indecent assault committed on 8 July 1994. In respect of both of those matters of aggravated indecent assault dealt with by that other District Court Judge the applicant had pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     4 On this occasion and in respect of the instant offence the applicant also pleaded guilty. The learned trial judge sentenced the applicant for the offence, which was before him on the indictment to imprisonment for six years and six months commencing on 20 July 2001. In respect of that sentence his Honour imposed a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing on that same commencement date. His Honour imposed, in respect of the breach of the s.12 bond in respect of the suspended sentence, a sentence of imprisonment for 12 months commencing on that same date. Thus that sentence was wholly concurrent with the sentence his Honour had imposed in respect of the offences prosecuted on the indictment and to which the appellant had pleaded guilty before him. 
      
       
     5 His Honour imposed a sentence of three months imprisonment in respect of the breach of the s.9 bond directing that sentence to commence on 20 January 2006, that is to say, at the expiration of the non-parole period for the offence prosecuted before his Honour on the indictment. Thus the effective period of custody that the appellant had to serve by way of the period during which he could not receive parole was a period of four years and nine months commencing on 20 July 2001 and expiring on 19 April 2006. The total period of imprisonment to which the applicant was liable as a consequence of these sentences was that period of six years and six months commencing on 20 July 2001. 
      
       
     6 The application for leave to appeal is within a very narrow compass. It is contended on the applicant’s behalf that his Honour erred in the starting point of his sentence calculations having regard to the objective criminality of these offences and all the circumstances of the case. It is submitted that error was translated into a sentence, which, on its face, exceeds that which is called for, that is a sentence which is truly manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     7 In support of the argument it is pointed out his Honour recognised that the particular nature of the acts performed by the appellant with the young boy were not physically invasive of the victim’s body as they might have been had other acts to which the section applied been perpetrated. 
      
       
     8 It must be recognised, however, that his Honour specifically adverted to that very matter when considering the appropriate sentence. It is not necessary to go into detail as to what acts were perpetrated. 
      
       
     9 True it is that, although the relevant act was one of the ways in which the legislature has defined the offence as being able to be committed, and although the offence committed in that way may be a serious offence, its culpability is not as serious as some other modes of commission of the offence but it is not to the point to say that there might be worse crimes within the section. The question that needs to be considered is whether this sentence is inappropriate to the crime as it was committed. 
      
       
     10 The matter involved the taking of advantage of a young boy in circumstances in which the offender had plied the young man with alcohol and seduced him in the offender’s home at a time at which the victim had apparently become ill. He was asleep when the criminal act was perpetrated upon him and attempted to refuse the advances of the applicant. 
      
       
     11 His Honour held in the applicant’s favour that the victim, although vulnerable and disadvantaged, was not a person towards whom the appellant was required by law to exercise a particular duty, the breach of which would create the aggravating circumstance of a particular abuse of trust. However, his Honour did not under estimate the serious nature of what had occurred. His Honour had regard also to the applicant’s prior record. 
      
       
     12 That record includes a number of offences, some of dishonesty, some involving driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol, but, in particular, includes offences commencing in 1991 of committing acts of indecency and other sexual offences with young children. 
      
       
     13 The appellant received a recognisance in 1991 for committing an act of indecency with a child under the age of 16. In South Australia in 1997 he was imprisoned for two years and one month with a non-parole period of eighteen months for the crime of unlawful sexual intercourse.  
      
       
     14 When he came before the court on 8 December 2000 he was dealt with for the two aggravated indecent assault offences to which I have referred and four additional matters on a schedule. Those four additional matters included the offence of incite person under sixteen to commit act of indecency, soliciting sexual intercourse, exhibiting a film in the presence of minors – which is referred to as relating to three counts presumably relating to three minors – and supply liquor to minors. 
      
       
     15 His Honour, when referring to the necessity for deterrence in the particular case, said the following:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I need, of course, in this particular case to deter Michael George Marshall from further offending in this way because the element of specific deterrence is present here. Mr Marshall, if he continued this type of conduct, would pass to another category which some people might describe as a predator. That is a person who habitually seeks out young men for the purpose of committing these offences.” 
         
        
       
     16 I do not apprehend that his Honour, in those remarks, was indicating that he had concluded that the applicant was a person who was presently dangerous to the community in that regard. However, I do apprehend that his Honour was having regard to the applicant’s past record of offences when he came to sentence for the present offences as indicating that the offender was not to receive such leniency as he might fully receive in the event that he had not such prior matters on his record as he has. His Honour had regard to the applicant’s personal circumstances and, in particular, that he suffered from an emotional disability for which he had been prescribed Lithium. 
      
       
     17 Our attention has been drawn to that matter today but it has not been submitted that his Honour there fell into such error as would warrant the court interfering with the sentence in the way in which his Honour had referred to that matter.  
      
       
     18 What has been submitted, shortly, is that the starting point for his Honour’s sentence, whatever that may mean in the context of this case, of nine years was too high and, thus, the result was too high. It was submitted that there was an effective sentence of five and a half years for this offence, that the totality of sentence, having regard to the course his Honour took in relation to the suspended sentence and the recognisance, produced a total sentence of seven years four months with a minimum term of five years seven months taking into account the periods in custody prior to the imposition of each sentence. 
      
       
     19 It is conceded, however, that his Honour acted entirely appropriately in the exercise of his discretion when dealing with the breaches of recognisance to which I have referred. When one has regard to the concurrence of the sentences imposed, in my mind I am assisted little by the submission concerning the submitted total effective sentence because, if one looks to this offence rather than looking to the sentences imposed for the matters before the other District Court judge, one notes that this sentence is a head sentence of five and a half years with a non parole period of three years six months. 
      
       
     20 It is submitted that this sentence was excessive on its face even in the circumstances of the prior offences. I do not accept that submission. It is only in the event that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed that this court, under s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should interfere. There needs to be some such error of discretion as shows that the sentence exceeds the permissible range available for a sentencing judge having regard to all the circumstances. 
      
       
     21 I am unpersuaded that his Honour fell into error in this way. I do not conclude that there is warranted in law some other sentence which should have been passed. The continued offending in this way was appropriately marked by his Honour by the sentence his Honour passed. In my view, since the matter has been fully argued, the application for leave should be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
      
       
     22 SPERLING, J: I agree. The orders of the court will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Sperling J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Kinchington DCJ sitting in the District Court at Sydney on 28 November 2001. 
      
       
     2 The applicant was charged with assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. The maximum penalty is equivalent to that for robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon, namely, 25 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     3 His Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of four years and six months imprisonment, to be served in a detention centre, with a non- parole period of two years. 
      
       
     4 The applicant pleaded guilty to the charge at the earliest opportunity. 
      
       
     5 The offence was committed on 27 May 2001. The applicant was born on 9 February 1986. He was fifteen years of age at the time of the offence. 
      
       
     6 The applicant approached and attacked the victim at Fairfield Railway Station at about 11.30pm on a Sunday night. The attack was planned. Two other males were in the vicinity keeping watch. The applicant demanded the victim’s mobile phone and threatening him with a knife and a loaded gun, which the applicant cocked in front of the victim. In a struggle that followed, the victim managed to hit the applicant and take his knife and gun from him.  
      
       
     7 On behalf of the applicant, it is submitted that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s youth and that he gave too much emphasis to general deterrence.  
      
       
     8 His Honour’s remarks about sentence were ex tempore. Subsequently, his Honour gave written reasons for sentence. There is no substantive departure in the written reasons from what was said in the ex tempore remarks on sentence. Subject to that constraint, a judge is entitled to revise reasons for decisions. Accordingly, the written reasons for decision should be treated as superseding the ex tempore remarks. This is not a point of importance, since, as I have said, the written reasons do not depart substantively from the ex tempore remarks. 
      
       
     9 The applicant had no criminal record. As I have mentioned, he pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, which his Honour took to be a genuine sign of the applicant’s remorse and contrition. His Honour found the applicant to be a relatively immature adolescent, vulnerable to negative peer group pressure. He had been bullied for some months prior to the commission of the offence and had taken up with a group of undesirable individuals for protection. He was not the leader in the planned operation to rob the victim. The applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and had been doing well in custody prior to sentence. He had an extremely supportive family which boded well for rehabilitation. 
      
       
     10 In the guideline judgment of Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 34, a sentence of four to five years was propounded as a starting point for the offence of armed robbery in the class of case described in that decision. 
      
       
     11 The applicant’s age, the early plea of guilty and the positive finding of contrition and remorse are considerations which moderate the present case referrable to the class of case on which the guideline sentence in Henry was based. The class of case in Henry included a young offender, but, at fifteen years of age, this applicant was very young. 
      
       
     12 The sentencing judge referred to the applicant’s youth on more than one occasion in his reasons for decision and he cited authorities which make clear the relevance of this factor. The principles are that, in the case of a young offender, there is a limited role for general deterrence and the emphasis should be on rehabilitation. There is a qualification that leniency should not be so readily afforded to the offender where the offence is one more commonly expected of an adult. The occasion for leniency arises where the offender’s immaturity has contributed to the commission of the offence. The principles were not spelt out in his Honour’s reasons for decision but they are so well understood that I would assume that his Honour had them in mind.  
      
       
     13 This was, in my view, a case which called for leniency by reason of the applicant’s youth. There is a passage in point in the judgment of Wood J in R v Hoai Vinh Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109, 
      
       
        
         
         In coming to that conclusion his Honour made reference to the well known principle that when courts are required to sentence a young offender considerations of punishment and general deterrence should in general be regarded as subordinate to the need to foster the offender’s rehabilitation:  
         Wilkie 
           
         (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 2 July 1992 unreported), 
           
         XYJ  
         (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 15 June 1992 unreported). That is a sensible principle to which full effect should be given in appropriate cases. It can have particular relevance where an offender is assessed as being at the cross roads between a life of criminality and a law abiding existence. 
         
        
       
     14 There is no doubt that the trial judge did make allowance for the applicant’s youth. The question is whether he made sufficient allowance having regard to the considerations which I have mentioned. 
      
       
     15 Another important consideration in mitigation was the plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity. The guideline range in Henry was predicated upon a class of case which included a late plea of guilty: Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [161]. The applicant was entitled to a discount of something in the order of twenty percent for the early plea whereas the guideline in Henry is necessarily predicated upon a lesser discount. I refer merely to the utilitarian value of the plea in this respect. 
      
       
     16 Having regard to these considerations, the sentence of four years and six months in the present case was excessive relative to the Henry guideline, notwithstanding that this was an aggravated offence in that the loaded gun was a dangerous weapon. I would, accordingly, set the sentence aside and re-sentence the applicant. 
      
       
     17 The applicant’s progress in prison has been exemplary. He has applied himself productively to his studies and has received numerous awards in recognition of his participation in a variety of programs. 
      
       
     18 A report by Dr J Grainger dated 22 July 2002 indicates a determination on the part of the applicant to behave responsibly when he is released. In broad terms, Dr Grainger regards the applicant’s prospect of complete rehabilitation as high. 
      
       
     19 I propose a sentence of three years commencing on 31 May 2001. I would find special circumstances having regard to the need for an extensive period of supervision on parole when the applicant is released. I would fix a non parole period of one year and six months expiring on 30 November 2002. Pursuant to s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, there should be an order that the applicant be released immediately on expiration of the non parole period.  
      
       
     20 The direction that the sentence be served in a detention centre should be preserved, as should the sentencing judge’s recommendation that the applicant serve the balance of his sentence at his present place of incarceration. 
      
       
     21 The orders I propose are accordingly as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. Grant leave to appeal; 
        
        
       2. Appeal allowed;  
        
        
       3. Sentence set aside; 
        
        
       4. Re-sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment of three years, commencing on 31 May 2001, with a non-parole period of one year and six months expiring on 30 November 2002; 
        
        
       5. Direct that the sentence be served in a detention centre; 
        
        
       6. Order that the applicant be released on 30 November 2002. 
        
       
     22 Greg James J: I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge and the reasons he has given. 
      
       
     23 Sperling J: The orders of the court will be as proposed by me.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: On 6 November 2001, Patten DCJ gave his decision in proceedings in which the appellant Guiseppa Lombardi had sued the first respondent Holroyd City Council (the Council) and the second respondent Australian Gaslight Company (AGL) for negligence in connection with injuries she suffered when she fell on a footpath at Westmead. The primary judge’s decision was that there be verdict and judgment for both respondents, and the primary judge ordered the appellant to pay the respondents’ costs. The appellant appeals to this Court from that decision. 
      
       
        
       CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
     2 The appellant is a widow, and was born in Italy on 1 January 1931.  
      
       
     3 At about 5pm on 7 November 1997, she was walking towards her home at 1 Austral Avenue, Westmead, when she fell on the footpath outside 33A Austral Avenue, and thereby suffered injuries. It appears that her foot had caught a small step between two adjoining slabs of concrete, which ranged from about 25 millimetres in height at the northern edge of the footpath down to about zero at the southern edge, and which had resulted from subsidence affecting one of the slabs. 
      
       
     4 The slab affected by subsidence had been replaced after being removed in 1993 or 1994 by AGL in the course of renewing gas pipelines, by a process known as “Goldline” whereby new pipes were inserted inside the existing pipes. The gas pipe in Austral Avenue ran east-west under the footpath, probably under the northern half of the footpath, and probably at a depth of about 700 millimetres at this point. The process required digging of holes about 1.6 metres long at intervals along the footpath, with the footpath slabs at these points being removed. The protocol between the Council and AGL regulated the procedure for replacement: AGL was to backfill the hole, properly compact the filling, and temporarily seal the surface with asphalt; and then the Council would replace the asphalt with a new concrete slab. This procedure was followed, and the slab in question was laid by the Council in about March 1994.  
      
       
     5 The evidence also indicated that there was a large diameter stormwater pipe running north-south across the line of the footpath at about this point, at a depth greater than that of the gas pipeline.  
      
       
     6 At the trial, there was expert engineering evidence concerning the causation of the subsidence, in addition to a preliminary report provided by an engineer Mr. Burn which provided measurements on which other experts relied. 
      
       
     7 Firstly, there was a report by Mr. Turner of Golder Associates Pty. Limited, who had been engaged by Zaro Concrete, a previous defendant in the case, and tendered at the trial by the appellant. Mr. Turner did not give oral evidence. In his report, he said the following: 
      
       
        
         
         The backfill surrounding the stormwater pipe may not have been adequately compacted when the pipe was installed. The settlement that has occurred could be subsidence of the pipe backfill at depth, rather than the higher level fill compacted by AGL. (However, if this were the case we would expect to see evidence of similar settlement at other locations along the stormwater pipe alignment). Alternatively the stormwater drain may be leaking locally beneath the footpath, causing the pipe backfill to saturate and settle. 
          
          
         We do not presently have sufficient information to assess the most likely cause of the settlement. The following section presents a scope of investigation to assist our further assessment. Whether this investigation is required may depend on the contract between Zaro Concrete and Holroyd Council. 
         
        
       
     8 Next, there was a report by Taylor Lauder Bersten Pty. Limited, also engaged by Zaro Concrete, which was tendered by the appellant. There was no oral evidence on the basis of this report. This report contained the following: 
      
       
        
         
         5.1 Our site inspection with Golder Associates on 9 May revealed: 
          
         a) very soft, saturated ground (backfill) and service trenches beside this pavement segment, to a depth on the northern side of 2m.  
          
         b) a 50mm high cavity beneath the segment extending over the area shown in Fig 2.  
          
         c) settlement of the northern side of the segment as shown in Fig. 1, which indicates that the north western corner has settled a further 9mm to 34mm since it was measured as being 25mm in 1998 by Burn 
          
         d) a rise in the level of the southern side of the segment as shown in Fig. 1. 
          
          
         5.2 All of the above factors indicate that the pavement segment has settled on the northern side after it was poured, and also before and after it was inspected by Burn. 
          
          
         5.3 The two repair 'ramps’ of cement mortar that were placed to alleviate the step towards the northern side could be assumed to have been finished level with the adjacent pavement segments. At the time of our inspection, they had settled 8mm and 10mm as shown in Fig. 1. This movement confirms that further settlement has occurred since the pavement was repaired. 
          
          
         6. Conclusion 
          
         6.1 The cause of the steps between this pavement segment and the adjacent pavements to the east and west is settlement and rotation of this segment. 
          
          
         6.2 The causes of settlement have been: 
          
         a) inadequate compaction of the backfilling material in the service trenches immediately adjacent to and beneath this segment, and 
          
         b) saturation of the backfilling by stormwater. 
         
        
       
     9 There was a report by Mr. Richmond of Sinclair Knight Merz Pty. Limited, engaged by the Council. This report was tendered by the Council, and there was no oral evidence by Mr. Richmond. This report expressed agreement with par.6.1 of the Taylor Lauder Bersten report, and expressed the following opinion: 
      
       
        
         
         5.1 The Cause 
          
         I have seen no evidence relating to the original reason that required the replacement or repair of this slab. Golders (16 May 2000) reported that it was due to damage caused during installation of underground services at this point. 
          
          
         5.1.1 Sub-surface Conditions 
          
         The investigations and site inspections undertaken have revealed that the soft sub-surface conditions, and the presence of sub-surface water exhibited at this location would allow a slab subsidence or rotation to occur. Whether the slab would rotate under its own weight or by imposition of loads in excess of those imposed by pedestrians has not been addressed. 
          
          
         5.1.2 Loading 
          
         As advised in the Golders report, the slab was supported by 150mm of apparently compacted road base material. I would be surprised if road base was compacted sufficiently to support the slab over soft material such as described by Golder. This certainty would provide insufficient support even for vehicle loading. 
          
          
         Whether the slab should have been designed to support loadings in excess of pedestrian loadings at this location has not been explored. It is my opinion that the easement between Austral Avenue and Moree Avenue would clearly be expected to carry some heavy vehicles to allow maintenance of the power lines if for no other reason. It also appears that vehicles have traversed the kerb in front of the easement along Austral Avenue. 
          
          
         Additionally, there is potential for the mail deliveries by motorcycle to have imposed sufficient loading close to the northern edge to rotate the stab in very soft soil. 
          
          
         5.1.3 The Stormwater Pipe 
          
         The weak sub-surface condition at the slab location is almost directly above the stormwater drainage pipe. I could find no evidence of subsidence above the pipe at other points along the pipe line. Backfilling to pipes such as this is normally undertaken in a uniform manner unless disturbance has resulted in introduction of different backfill materials or different standards of compaction. 
          
          
         5.1.4. The Utilities 
          
         If the process of installation of underground gas mains AGL also disturbed the backfill to the stormwater pipe, and council was unaware of the nature of the disturbance, then appropriate action could not be taken. 
          
          
         Such a disturbance would relate to excavation and backfill to lesser standard of compaction, and provision of an additional water source (the new gas main) leading directly to the lesser compacted material directly beneath the new slab. My observations of the underground main at the intersection of the easement with Moree Avenue were that the water was flowing along the conduit and directly entering the utility pit. It is considered that this is also occurring along Austral Avenue. 
          
          
         The influence of these levels of sub-surface water in disturbed ground is to cause substantial weakening and loss of uniform support beneath the slab. 
          
          
         5.2 Comments on the Particulars of Negligence 
          
         5.2.1 Failing to exercise due and proper care. 
          
         Council provided a formal repair to pathway damages introduced by others. I am satisfied that the new footpath slab was originally constructed in a workmanlike manner level with the adjoining slabs. 
          
          
         The provision of suitable foundation conditions to provide a durable pathway does not appear to have been provided even though it appears that a standard practice (provision of 150mm compacted base material) was adopted. 
          
          
         The extent of the repairs undertaken are not reported to have extended to reconstruction of disturbed materials around the underlying stormwater pipe, or to provision of sub-surface drainage required as a result of the work by AGL or others. 
          
          
         In this regard it is considered that the utilities installation created a water source that did not exist prior to their work, and that this was a factor in causing lower quality foundation for the slab. 
         
        
       
     10 Finally, there was a report by Mr. Kiernan, engaged by the appellant, and tendered by the appellant. Mr. Kiernan gave oral evidence at the hearing, and was cross-examined. His report contained the following passages: 
      
       
        
         
         The backfill has subsided beneath the slab and this indicates the likelihood of inadequate compaction or loss of material resulting in the downward movement of the material below the concrete restoration. 
          
          
         The significant drop in level on one side, the northern side of the restored concrete footpath slab, indicates that the excavation beneath the footpath was confined to beneath the northern portion of the concrete footpath and the earth beneath the southern edge was probably not disturbed. 
          
          
         If this is correct, the concrete slab subsidence is most likely differential settlement of the northern portion supported on backfill, and the southern portion on the undisturbed ground surface. The deeper the opening trench the more likely some settlement would occur to the backfill. This type of subsidence occurs when a short trench is excavated beside and/or just under the concrete footpath. Unless compaction is rigidly controlled, the footpath will tilt towards and/or subside on the trench opening side. 
          
          
         The geotechnical investigation recorded a cavity beneath the northern half of the footpath. Also that it was very soft backfill to a depth of 2 metres on the northern side. A depth of 2 metres seems unusual, unless the Goldline plant was laid under the stormwater pipeline that crosses Austral Avenue. But in any event, if the footpath opening extended part way across the concrete footpath alignment, compaction of the backfill would have been highly critical in providing a satisfactory surface for restoration of the concrete footpath. And if the trench or opening depth was 2 metres, it is highly likely that the concrete slab tilted as a result of differential movement between the compacted backfill and the ground surface beneath the southern side of the footpath. 
          
          
         The ground is said to have been saturated at the time of inspection. While the restored slab is at a sag point in Austral Avenue, the footpath has crossfalls to disperse stormwater runoff. Under normal circumstances water should not penetrate the subsurface at this point and this seems unusual. However, a localised depression has been formed as a result of the subsidence, and this may have saturated the backfill material over time. Any link between the saturated backfill and the major stormwater pipeline beneath the footpath seems unlikely. 
         
        
       
     11 During cross-examination, Mr. Kiernan gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. I see. What is the cause in your opinion of the saturation which was - saturation of the back-filling which was identified by some of the other experts? 
          
         A. I really am uncertain about that, I can't really be sure. Had I been there investigating it I may have been a little bit more able to make a comment but I really can't comment on it. 
          
          
         Q. If there was an independent source of water whether by natural drainage or something else, would that have the potential to wash away back-fill, properly compacted back-fill?  
          
         A. Only if there was some cavity in the trenching or the ground beneath. 
          
          
         Q. All right. Why do you express the scepticism, if I can use that word, about the trench being two metres deep and I will take an example of that - yes, on the top of page 10 you say depth of two metres seems unusual, do you see that? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Why do you say that? 
          
         A. Why do I say that? 
          
          
         Q. Yes? 
          
         A. Well, most utility services aren’t two metres down. 
          
          
         Q. And do you have - do you actually have any experience yourself as to how deep the gas pipes may have been in this particular area? 
          
         A. Yes - oh, well, not in this particular area but as a general rule services are between one metre and, say, 600 to one metre below the footpath level. 
          
          
         Q. It wouldn't surprise you if the depth of the gas pipe in that area was point 7 of a metre, approximately? 
          
         A. No, that would be reasonable. 
          
          
         Q. That's within your experience? 
          
         A. Yes, that's correct. 
          
          
         Q. You would agree with me, wouldn't you, that, if gold lining involves putting a new pipe down the centre of an old pipe, there would be no need from an engineering perspective to dig a trench at all? 
          
         A. No, that's right. 
          
          
         Q. And if there was no trench involved along the side of the footpath your thesis falls away, doesn't it, as to the reason that the footpath subsided? 
          
         A. Well, I saw restoration orders between AGL and council and this area was one of those restoration orders, so there is a reasonable assumption that AGL, did something there. 
          
          
         Q. But those restoration orders that you saw didn't involve any trenching, did they? 
          
         A. No, they only referred to concrete footpath restorations. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         Q. So where did you get the - if I have understood your evidence correctly - the idea that there was some reference to trenching on this piece of paper or some other piece of paper? 
          
         A. Well, I don't have any reference to trenching at all. It was an opening of the footpath and a series of openings in the footpath suggest that you opened the footpath or removed the concrete to get to the material underneath. 
          
          
         Q.. By a hole?  
          
         A. Yes, could be a hole. 
          
          
         Q. And just staying with number 33A, you would accept, wouldn't you, that if there was a hole with dimensions 1.6 by point 7 metres, in its linear dimensions, that it would be most unlikely that such a hole would be two metres deep?  
          
         A. Yes, that's correct. 
          
          
         Q. It wouldn't be workable, would it? 
          
         A. No, that's right. 
          
          
         Q. And you would agree with me that an opening of about that size would be consistent with someone excavating down to about point 7 of a metre? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Or thereabouts? 
          
         A. That's correct. 
          
          
         Q. You, at page 10 of your report, you dismiss the stormwater pipe as being a source of the saturated back-fill, do you see that, about halfway down? 
          
         A. Yes, that's right. 
          
          
         Q. What's - what causes you to reach that conclusion? 
          
         A. Well, I don't - I didn't have any evidence of it. I don't see that it was any different to any low point in any street anywhere and I didn't see why - that this should be a particular problem at this point. 
          
          
         Q. I see. And just assuming again for the moment that what we are talking about here is not a trench but a series of holes, does that change the opinion that you express on the bottom of page 10 where you say, ""Assuming the opening was up to two metres deep along the one side of the footpath, special attention to back-filling and restoration was required at this location"" and you are talking about a trench there? 
          
         A. Well, I see what you mean. The word ""special” of course referred to the depth. 
          
          
         Q. That's right? 
          
         A. And I must say that the word ""trench"" I am using in the loose context, in other words if you are excavating a hole that is say one metre long, it tends to be a trench. 
          
          
         Q. I see. You are not suggesting there was a continuous trench along the northern side of the footpath? 
          
         A. No - well, no, not necessarily. 
         
        
       
     12 He gave the following evidence in re-examination: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. From an engineering point of view, Mr Kiernan, there would be no need to talk about replacing a footpath restoration due to poor back-filling procedures unless the hole that was being dug was of a size that required significant compacting. 
          
         MINEHAN: I raise the same objection, your Honour. He is asking the witness to interpret the letter, your Honour.  
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: No, I will allow the question. 
          
         WITNESS: Yes, I think even at point 7 and we don't know the extent of the hole, I don't know whether there is any evidence to talk about how - or the dimensions of the hole - if you have a problem with the area you might extend the hole, it could extend out. So it's a worthy - a statement worthy of being made, indicates that correct procedures have to be done even for 700 millimetres. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         Q. So that if the - there had been adequate compacting of this particular slab, then it should not have reacted any differently from the adjoining slabs? 
          
         A. That's correct. 
          
          
         Q. If we're talking about a hole, whatever its dimensions, then sub-soil water, unlike, say, a trench with water can run along a trench, sub-soil water is unlikely to be any more of a problem at a particular point than at any other point, that is -- 
          
          
         A. Entry of sub-soil water is not known at this point. As a general rule I think the answer is, no, there is no difference.  
          
          
         Q. Again adequate compacting is likely to deal with that?  
          
         A. Yes, that's correct. 
          
          
         Q. If we are talking of something of the order of three and a half years between when this slab is laid and when this accident occurs, of that order, perhaps a little bit less, we are talking about a subsidence of a fraction over 7 millimetres a year? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. In terms of compacting, does that indicate a significant failure of compacting? 
          
         A. Yes 
         
        
       
     13 The primary judge reached the following conclusion concerning the appellant’s claim against AGL: 
      
       
        
         
         The expert opinions were, in so far as they suggest responsibility on the part of AGL, I think, undermined by references to a 2m deep trench on the northern side of the pavement. There is no evidence that AGL, was involved with such a trench. Moreover, there was no evidence that either Defendant was involved with the stormwater pipe line referred to. That being so and, in light of the passage of about three and a half years between the restoration of the pavement by the Council and the accident which befell the Plaintiff, I am not persuaded, on the probabilities, that it was established that the restoration of the footpath was negligently carried out. It seems to me equally probable that between the restoration and the Plaintiffs fall, some other cause, such as water penetration or the digging of a 2m deep trench on the northern side of the pavement, caused subsidence. As a consequence of this finding, the Plaintiff s action against AGL must necessarily fail. 
         
        
       
     14 As regards the appellant’s case against the Council, the primary judge referred to Ghantous v. Hawkesbury City Council (2001) 75 ALJR 992, and concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         In this case, according to the evidence, at its greatest point, (the northern extremity) the difference in height between the two adjoining sections of the footpath was of the order of 25mm or about one inch. It was plainly visible, as appears in the photographs tendered in evidence, and could not, in any way, be categorised as a concealed hazard. In my opinion, the fact that the Council permitted the height differential to continue without repair until after the Plaintiffs accident (when it was patched) did not constitute negligence on its part. 
         
        
        
       GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
     15 The appellant relied on the following grounds of appeal: 
      
       
        
         
         1. That His Honour erred in failing to find that temporary restorative work undertaken by the Second Respondent including compacting underneath the footpath in question was negligently carried out thereby causing subsidence. 
          
          
         2. That His Honour erred in failing to find that the First Respondent owed the applicant a non-delegated duty of care in respect of work done to the footpath by its agent Zaro Concrete Pty Limited (the Second Defendant below) and that such work was negligently carried out.  
          
          
         3. That His Honour erred in finding the First Respondents failure to carry out repairs until after the subject accident did not constitute negligence on its part. 
          
          
         4. That His Honour erred in failing to distinguish the decision of Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council (2001) 75 ALJR 992 from the facts in the instant case. 
         
        
        
       SUBMISSIONS 
       
     16 Dr. Morrison SC for the appellant submitted that the state of the pavement at the time of the accident, with a step of about 25 millimetres, was an unacceptable tripping hazard. He referred to a concession to that effect by Mr. Franca, maintenance engineer for the Council. He referred to an opinion to similar effect by a consulting engineer Mr. Burn, and also to a document purporting to be a guideline on risk management prepared by “Statewide”, a group managed by Jardine Matheson.  
      
       
     17 Dr. Morrison submitted that the evidence established that this was caused by inadequate compacting by AGL. He submitted that the primary judge’s reliance on a two metre deep trench was misconceived: the debate at the trial was not whether someone else had dug a two metre deep trench, but rather whether the AGL trench or pit was about 700 centimetres or about two metres deep. There was no evidence that anyone else had dug any pit or trench in the area. The expert evidence was that subsidence was due to inadequate compacting and ingress of water, itself due to inadequate compacting: there was no evidence that anyone other than AGL was involved in any relevant excavation, or that some other excavation or problem could have caused the subsidence.  
      
       
     18 Dr. Morrison submitted that it had not been put to Mr. Kiernan that, even with adequate compacting by AGL, subsidence could have happened because of a two metre pit or trench dug by someone else. This was glaringly improbable in any event: any deeper pit or trench would probably have been dug twenty years ago when the stormwater drain was installed, yet no problem occurred until the AGL work was done about three years before the accident. Mr. Kiernan’s evidence was that, even if the AGL trench only went down to about 700 centimetres, that did not alter his conclusion that subsidence was due to inadequate compaction by AGL.  
      
       
     19 As against the Council, Dr. Morrison submitted that the Council was liable for AGL’s negligence, because it permitted AGL to do work on the footpath: RTA v. Scroop (1998) 28 MVR 233 at 238. In any event, the Council itself installed the new pavement, and thereby undertook the responsibility of ensuring the foundation had been properly laid. This was therefore a case of misfeasance, and Ghantous was distinguishable. Dr. Morrison submitted that, because the Council installed this slab, it should have checked subsequently as to subsidence; but in any event, the risk which arose was such that it should have been detected and rectified. The change in level was not beside the path or due to natural causes, as in Ghantous. Dr. Morrison referred to Hawkesbury City Council v. Ryan [2001] NSWCA 212 and Parramatta City Council v. Watkins [2001] NSWCA 364. 
      
       
     20 Mr. Garling SC for the Council submitted that Scroop was distinguishable. The Council did not “permit” AGL to work on the footpath: AGL was entitled to do so without the Council’s permission (Gas Supply Act 1996 ss.47, 48). In any event, there was no non-delegable duty: see Ghantous at [6]-[7], [150]. Accordingly, even if AGL had been negligent, the Council was not liable for that negligence.  
      
       
     21 Mr. Garling then submitted that the risk was not such as to make it negligent for the Council not to have detected and rectified the problem.  
      
       
     22 Mr. Minehan for AGL submitted that there was clear evidence of a two metre pit or trench immediately to the north of the slab, dug by someone else, and that problems from that trench caused or contributed to the subsidence. Mr. Minehan submitted that neither the appellant nor the experts made out a case that, even if AGL was not responsible for the two metre pit or trench to the north of the footpath, subsidence was caused by AGL’s inadequate backfilling of its 700 millimetre pit or trench underneath the footpath.  
      
       
        
       DECISION 
       
     23 In my opinion, there was an inference open that AGL had dug a pit under the slab to a depth of around 700 millimetres, and certainly no greater than about 850 millimetres; and that there was another pit or trench to a depth of two metres immediately to the north of the slab. The primary judge drew that inference, and in my opinion made no error in doing so.  
      
       
     24 The expert opinions supported the view that it was deficiency in backfilling and ingress of water that caused the subsidence. However, the opinions did not differentiate between deficiencies associated with an AGL pit of around 700 millimetres and the two metre pit or trench; and did not identify the source of the water. On that basis, in my opinion it was open to the primary judge not to be satisfied that the problem was due to AGL’s inadequate backfilling and compacting.  
      
       
     25 It is true that the primary judge might have inferred that the two metre pit or trench was dug about twenty years ago, when the stormwater pipe was installed; that there was no indication of subsidence problems until the AGL work was done; and that accordingly, AGL caused the subsidence by its own inadequate backfilling and compaction, or by introducing a source of water to the two metre pit, or both. It does seem clear that water could have been introduced to the area by opening up the old gas pipes and inserting the smaller new gas pipes inside them, leaving a space along which water could run. However, this basis of liability in AGL was not specifically addressed or supported by any of the experts, so in my opinion one cannot find appealable error of the primary judge in not reasoning along those lines.  
      
       
     26 The problem for the appellant of evidence of a two metre deep pit or trench was raised in cross-examination, and there is no evidence that it was not raised in submissions; so in my opinion there is no substance in any suggestion that the primary judge decided the case on a basis that was not fairly before him.  
      
       
     27 For all these reasons, in my opinion there is no appealable error in the primary judge reaching the conclusion that there was deficiency in proof by the appellant as to whether the subsidence was the fault of AGL or was due to other causes associated with the two metre pit or trench for which AGL had no responsibility.  
      
       
     28 As regards the Council, in my opinion the finding in relation to AGL is fatal to any liability of the Council based on the backfilling by AGL and the installation of the pavement by the Council. No basis was suggested on which the Council could be held liable for problems associated with the two metre deep pit or trench.  
      
       
     29 As regards liability in the Council for failure to detect and rectify the problem, it is my opinion that the evidence does not suggest that the problem was of such a magnitude or persisted for such a time as to justify a finding of negligence in the Council for failure to detect and rectify it. The primary judge’s conclusion to this effect was justified by Ghantous pars.[5]-[7], [163]-[168], [245]-[248], and [355].  
      
       
     30 Dr. Morrison relied on my judgment in Watkins. That case concerned a sharp 50 millimetre change of level from the surface of a road to a manhole cover, where the Council had re-surfaced the road and achieved a gradual transition for one such cover but not for this one; and where this manhole cover was in a position where it could be partially obscured by parked vehicles. In those circumstances, I was not satisfied that the District Court judge who found negligence in the Council was wrong. I made the following comments at par.[27]:  
      
       
        
         
         [27] I am inclined to think that sudden variations in level of this magnitude may generally be expected at the edge of footpaths, at transitions between different paths or surfaces, and even between footpath slabs in the vicinity of trees; and also between paved and unpaved areas of road. However, the same may not be true within the paved surface of an apparently well-maintained road, particularly where the change of level is not obvious; and the circumstance that the change in level in this case was in a designated parking area, where it could be partially obscured by a parked car, would add to the risk. While the matter is not free from doubt, I am not satisfied that the primary judge was wrong to hold that the change in level was an unreasonable hazard in this case. 
         
        
       
     31 In the present case, there was evidence from the engineer Mr. Burn that “under normal circumstances the average pedestrian raises their foot approximately ten millimetres when walking”, there was the risk management document classifying a footpath “trip size” of 20-30 millimetres as high risk, even in good lighting; and there was the concession by Mr. Franca from the Council that the 25 millimetre step in this case was an unacceptable tripping risk. 
      
       
     32 However, I do not entirely accept Mr. Burn’s evidence as to the extent to which an average pedestrian raises his or her foot; and even if one accepts that the lowest part of the foot is often only about ten millimetres above the ground as it passes the other foot, the front of the foot is higher at this point, and the foot rises further as it moves forward. I do not accept that a plainly visible step of 25 millimetres in a footpath is correctly regarded as high risk or unacceptable risk. It is desirable that even obvious steps of 25 millimetres in footpaths be avoided and eliminated if possible; but that is not to say that the failure of a Council to detect and eliminate all such risk is negligent. As a general rule, in my opinion it is not.  
      
       
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     33 For those reasons, in my opinion the following order should be made: appeal dismissed with costs. 
      
       
     34 FOSTER AJA: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
      
       
     35 BROWNIE AJA: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
      
       
     36 Even if one accepted the evidence of Mr. Burn, that pedestrians ordinarily raise their feet about ten millimetres when walking, I do not think that, without more, a height differential of 25 millimetres between two footpath slabs means that an inference should be drawn that the Council was negligent in failing to rectify that situation.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Sperling J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Taylor DCJ sitting in the District Court at Sydney on 23 November 2001. The applicant had pleaded guilty to one count of receiving for which the maximum penalty is ten years' imprisonment. 
      
       
     2 The applicant was apprehended with his co-offender on 25 April 2000, one Robert Maher. The goods received consisted of a quantity of cigarettes with a retail value of $89,000. 
      
       
     3 The sentencing judge described the objective criminality of the two men as similar. His Honour did not indicate that one rather than the other was guilty on a higher level of criminality. I would construe what his Honour said in that regard to mean that, in his Honour's opinion, the objective criminality of the two men was materially the same. On the material before the Court that is the case. 
      
       
     4 The applicant asked the court to take into account on sentence five other offences of receiving, involving cigarettes with a retail value of $71,960. These offences were committed during a period preceding the offence charged, between 6 and 20 April 2000. 
      
       
     5 On 26 October 2000, Mr Maher was sentenced by Williams DCJ to imprisonment for a term of two years and six months with a non-parole period of one year. The sentence in the present case was a term of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of one year and eight months. 
      
       
     6 The applicant seeks leave to appeal on the ground that Taylor DCJ failed to implement the principle of parity referable to the sentence imposed on the applicant's co-offender. 
      
       
     7 Mr Maher had a significantly worse criminal history. The applicant's argument is that the additional offences taken into account in relation to the applicant were offset by Mr Maher's worse criminal history and, accordingly, the applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance in having received a sentence so much more severe than that imposed on Mr Maher. 
      
       
     8 The argument should not be accepted. A criminal history can preclude leniency otherwise available. On the other hand, other offences taken into account go to the total criminality for which the offender is to be sentenced, subject only to the maximum penalty for the offence charged. In this case, the other offences significantly increased the value of the property involved and demonstrated a course of planned criminal conduct over a period of some weeks prior to the offence charged. The degree of criminality was correspondingly higher. 
      
       
     9 The sentencing judge knew of Mr Maher's sentence and appreciated that he was bound to observe the principle of parity. 
      
       
     10 In view of the considerations to which I have referred, the relativity between the two sentences was not inappropriate and the present applicant has no legitimate sense of grievance arising from the difference between them. 
      
       
     11 I would grant the application for leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.  
      
       
     12 Greg James J: I agree. 
      
       
     13 Sperling J: The orders of the court will be as I proposed.

    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is the fourth in a series of decisions arising out of an application by the first to seventh defendants for summary dismissal of the proceeding commenced against them in November 2000, on the ground that the proceeding is time barred under the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW). The cause of action asserted against the first to seventh defendants in the proceeding is that they were negligent, as directors, in permitting Clutha to trade whilst insolvent during the period from September 1994 to February 1995. In Clutha v Millar [2002] NSWSC 362 (6 May 2002) I held that Clutha's pleaded case in negligence, which is the subject of the present proceeding, was statute barred against the first to seventh defendants. This was essentially on the ground that the cause of action in negligence accrued when damage was first suffered, and according to the pleading damage was first suffered more than six years before the commencement of the proceeding. 
     
      
    2 Clutha applied to amend its statement of claim to confine the asserted negligence to the period from November 1994 to February 1995, so as to fit within the six-year limitation period. In Clutha v Millar (No 2) [2002] NSWSC 523 (12 June 2002) I held that Clutha's application to amend the statement of claim must be denied as against the first to seventh defendants on the grounds that there was no jurisdiction to grant leave to amend and that if there were, I would nevertheless decline the application in the exercise of my discretion. 
     
      
    3 Before I made any orders consequent upon these two decisions, counsel for Clutha applied for leave to re-open Clutha's case to make submissions on two New South Wales Court of Appeal decisions. One of them was decided after I delivered my judgment in Clutha No 2, and the other had been overlooked in earlier submissions. I granted leave as sought, and heard further argument. In Clutha v Millar (No 3) [2002] NSWSC 642 (24 July 2002) I decided that the two Court of Appeal judgments were not inconsistent with my reasoning in Clutha No 1, and that there was no ground for withdrawing or amending my earlier reasons for judgment. 
     
      
    4 Immediately after publishing my reasons for judgment in Clutha No 3 on the morning of 24 July 2002, I made an order (Order No 1) dismissing Clutha's notice of motion for amendment of the statement of claim, as against the first seven defendants, and an order (Order No 2) dismissing the whole of the proceeding as against the first seven defendants. 
     
      
    5 Apart from various applications with respect to costs, it appeared to me at that stage that the next matter to be dealt with in the present proceeding was whether the proceeding should also be dismissed against the 10th and 11th defendants. Clutha seeks to establish that they are vicariously liable for the negligence of their employees, who were, respectively, a director and an alternate director of Clutha. They had foreshadowed that if the first seven defendants were successful, they would make an application for equivalent orders, or for a stay of the proceeding. Indeed, they filed their application on the following day, 25 July 2002. Resolution of that application will require determination of at least one contested question of fact, namely the question whether the eighth defendant became a director of Clutha on 28 November 2000 or 30 November 2000. There may also be a contest as to whether Clutha incurred debts during that two day period. 
     
      
    6 However, another issue was raised later on 24 July 2002, when I heard an urgent application by the 10th and 11th defendants. Their counsel had become concerned, in light of James Hardie & Co Pty Ltd v Seltsam Pty Ltd (1998) 196 CLR 53, that Order No 2 made by me on the morning of 24 July 2002 might, once entered, extinguish their right to claim contribution from the first seven defendants as joint tortfeasors, if the proceeding were to continue against them and the plaintiff were to be successful. I decided to receive submissions from the parties on the issue, and pending consideration of the issue, I vacated Order No 2. The order had not been entered. The present reasons for judgment relate to this issue. 
     
      
    7 Section 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW) provides, relevantly, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(1) Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime or not) - 
         
        … 
         
        (c) any tort-feasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution from any other tort-feasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tort-feasor or otherwise, so, however, that no person shall be entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by the person in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is sought. 
         
        (2) In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person's responsibility for the damage; and the court shall have power to exempt any person from liability to make contributions; or to direct that the contribution to be recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity."" 
        
       
      
    8 The section reverses the position at common law, under which neither joint nor concurrent tortfeasors could recover contribution from one another: Seltsam at 75 per Kirby J. However, as the judgments in Seltsam record, the section has created many problems of interpretation, largely because it fails to explain the significance, to tortfeasors inter se, of defences that one of them may have against the plaintiff. These difficulties have led to reform of the section in many jurisdictions (as noted in Seltsam by Kirby J at 75 and Callinan J at 97-8). 
     
      
    9 One of the earliest problems identified after the enactment of the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935 (UK), upon which the New South Wales section was closely based, was whether the claimant tortfeasor's right of contribution would be extinguished if the target tortfeasor had a limitation defence to the tort victim's action. The effect of George Wimpey & Co Ltd v British Overseas Airways Corporation [1955] AC 169 and Harvey v R G O'Dell Ltd, Galway (Third Party) [1958] 2 QB 78 was explained by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Seltsam (at 60) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""If P sued D2 and was met by a good plea that the action against D2 was time barred, D1's claim for contribution against D2 would fail. However, if P sued D1 but not D2, D1 would have a good claim to contribution by D2 because at some time in the past P would have had a good cause of action against D2."" 
        
       
      
    10 This anomaly was noted by the Law Commission of the United Kingdom, Law of Contract - Report on Contribution (Report 181, 15 December 1976), paragraph 60ff. The Law Commission's Report led to the enactment in the United Kingdom of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 (UK). Under the new legislation, although a limitation Act might bar the plaintiff's remedy against the target tortfeasor, it does not extinguish the right of the claimant tortfeasor to recover contribution from the target tortfeasor: Nottingham Health Authority v Nottingham City Council [1988] 1 WLR 903. The reforms adopted in various Australian States and New Zealand operate to the same effect: see Seltsam per Callinan J at 97-8. 
     
      
    11 Thus the question of the effect of a limitation defence available to one tortfeasor upon another tortfeasor's right to claim contribution under the unreformed section is anything but a novel question. Because there has been no reform of s 5 (1) (c) in New South Wales, one would expect the position here to reflect the anomaly that led to reform elsewhere. In other words, one would expect the law of New South Wales to be, as established in the George Wimpey case in England, that if the plaintiff's action is brought to judgment and fails because the latter has a good limitation defence, the claimant tortfeasor's claim for contribution against the target tortfeasor must also fail. 
     
      
    12 The position is rendered somewhat unclear by the decision of the High Court in Brambles Constructions Pty Ltd v Helmers (1966) 114 CLR 213. In that case there are observations in the judgments of Barwick CJ (at 219) and Windeyer J (at 221) to the effect that the words ""if sued"" in s 5 (1) (c) can be read as meaning ""if sued at any time"" and therefore do not import any temporal element into the section. Consequently those words are satisfied if the plaintiff could have successfully brought an action against the target tortfeasor at any time before the liability of the claimant tortfeasor to the plaintiff was in fact ascertained. Taken literally and out of context, these observations might suggest, contrary to the George Wimpey decision, that the claimant tortfeasor can recover contribution from the target tortfeasor notwithstanding that the latter has established a good limitation defence against the plaintiff. Fortunately, however, the position has been clarified by the High Court in Seltsam's case. 
     
      
    13 In Seltsam's case the plaintiff sued three defendants as concurrent tortfeasors in the Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales, for compensation in respect of pleural diseases alleged by him to have arisen from his inhalation of asbestos dust and fibre at work. The plaintiff claimed that for about 20 years he had worked with asbestos whilst employed by the Electricity Commission, the sole supplier of asbestos during that time being James Hardie; and that for 20 years before taking employment with the Electricity Commission, he had worked in the building industry, where the suppliers of asbestos products were James Hardie and Seltsam. James Hardie and Seltsam filed cross-claims against one another, seeking indemnity or contribution in the event that they respectively were found to be liable to the plaintiff. After the commencement of the final hearing, the plaintiff settled his claims against James Hardie and the Electricity Commission, and judgment was entered against each of those defendants for an agreed sum. Shortly afterwards the plaintiff concluded a separate settlement agreement with Seltsam, under which judgment was entered for Seltsam. 
     
      
    14 Before that Order was made, counsel for James Hardie informed the Tribunal that his client did not consent to judgment in favour of Seltsam against the plaintiff, and asserted that the judgment would not impair his client's statutory right to seek contribution from James Hardie, but he did not argue against the entry of judgment. Subsequently Seltsam moved in the Tribunal, successfully, for an order striking out James Hardie's cross-claim. An appeal by James Hardie against that order was dismissed by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales and by the High Court of Australia. 
     
      
    15 In the High Court the majority comprised Gaudron and Gummow JJ (who delivered a joint judgment) and Callinan J. Kirby J (with whom McHugh J agreed) delivered a dissenting judgment. Gaudron and Gummow JJ held (at 67) that s 5 (1) (c) establishes a right to recover compensation against: 
     
      
      (i) those who have come under an obligation to pay money in respect of the same damage, and 
       
      (ii) those who, not having been sued by the injured party, would, had they been sued, have been found to have caused or contributed to the same damage by a tortious act. 
       
      
    16 According to their Honours (at 67) ""there is no third category which identifies a person from whom contribution may be recovered by reference to the circumstance that this person has been sued and has been held not liable"". 
     
      
    17 On the facts before them, Seltsam had been sued to judgment and therefore it was not within category (ii), and it had not come under an obligation to pay money to the plaintiff because a consent judgment had been entered in its favour. A principal point of disagreement between the majority and the minority judgments related to whether the statutory wording defeated James Hardie's right of contribution where there had not been a determination in favour of Seltsam on the merits, but only by consent judgment (see Kirby J at 87). Gaudron and Gummow JJ held that, although the judgment was by consent, it determined conclusively as between the plaintiff and Seltsam that Seltsam was not liable, and consequently took James Hardie outside the statutory categories (at 62, quoting with approval from the judgment of Mason P in the Court of Appeal). 
     
      
    18 Their Honours expressly referred to several anomalies, including that created by the George Wimpey decision with respect to limitation defences, as identified by the Law Commission in its Report. They continued (at 60): 
     
      
       
        
        ""We mention these matters not to urge or criticise any of the stances taken by the Law Commission. Rather, they serve to emphasise the need for renovation of the New South Wales legislation, not by judicial grafting to it of tissue which it lacks, but upon a detailed reconsideration by the legislature. Judicial interpretive techniques may come close to leaching the existing statutory text and structure of their content and, while answering the apparently hard case then before the court, unwittingly lay the ground for other hard cases."" 
        
       
      
    19 Those observations confirm that in their Honours' view, the position with respect to limitation defences established in the George Wimpey decision remains part of the law of New South Wales, pending legislative reform, however anomalous the outcome may be. 
     
      
    20 As to the Brambles decision, their Honours emphasised and applied the remarks of Barwick CJ (114 CLR at 219) to the effect that contribution is available only if the target tortfeasor has come under an obligation to pay money in respect of the same damage (their Honours' category (i)), or has not been sued by the tort victim but had he been sued, would have been found to have caused or contributed to the same damage by a tortious act (category (ii), expressed by Barwick CJ in a manner that makes it clear that this category does not apply where the target tortfeasor has been sued to judgment). Seen in this way, the Brambles decision generally requires the Court to consider whether the target tortfeasor would have been liable if sued at any time, but that inquiry is irrelevant if the target tortfeasor has been sued to judgment. Gaudron and Gummow JJ (at 68) referred to Hart v Hall & Pickles Ltd [1969] 1 QB 405 and explained that category (ii) applies in the manner described by Windeyer J in Brambles if the target tortfeasor is sued but the action is dismissed for want of prosecution. This was ""because [in Hart v Hall & Pickles Ltd] the phrase ""if sued"" was rendered inapplicable only if the tortfeasor in question had been sued to judgment and the dismissal for want of prosecution was but an interlocutory order"". 
     
      
    21 Callinan J delivered a separate judgment but, in my view, his decision supports the reasoning of Gaudron and Gummow JJ. He referred with approval to the George Wimpey case, and said (at 96): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Contrary to the submission of the appellant, the respondent here does not in my opinion fall into the latter category. The use of the words ""if sued"" leads to the conclusion that those who fall within that category must be tortfeasors who have not in fact been sued by the plaintiff. 
         
        Nor can the respondent fall into the former category for it is not liable for the damage, that is, the damage to the plaintiff to which the subsection makes reference. Indeed it is the final judgment in this case that establishes that the respondent is not liable for the damage suffered by the plaintiff."" 
        
       
      
    22 It follows, in my view, that the majority decision in Seltsam establishes the principle that if the Court has found the target tortfeasor to be not liable to the tort victim because of a limitation defence, and orders are made and entered accordingly, the claimant tortfeasor has no right of contribution against the target tortfeasor under s 5 (1) (c). In the present case, my judgments in Clutha (No 1) and Clutha (No 3) amount to a finding that the first seven defendants have a good limitation defence and are therefore not liable to Clutha. I have reached this conclusion in proceedings for summary dismissal, rather than as a result of a trial on the merits, but once I enter judgment for the first seven defendants, my determination will be as final and conclusive as the consent judgment in favour of Seltsam, or, indeed, as final and conclusive as a judgment after a full hearing on the merits. Consequently, the principle emerging from Seltsam is directly applicable to the present case. The outcome may be anomalous but the anomaly is a matter to be rectified by the legislature, rather than by a judicial interpretation that might ""leach the existing statutory text"" of its content. 
     
      
    23 In Seltsam, Gaudron and Gummow JJ pointed out that James Hardie did not take all the steps open to it to protect and advance its position (at 62). It had the right to be heard before the Tribunal and might have sought deferral of the entry of judgment, the negotiation of a release that would have protected its position, or (having been heard on the matter) an appeal against the entry of judgment. As I read their Honours' judgment, their observation that James Hardie might have sought deferral of the entry of judgment was related to their observation that options might have been explored by negotiation, such as release between the plaintiff and Seltsam without extinguishment of James Hardie's right to maintain its action for contribution. The idea that entry of judgment might be deferred was therefore, in my view, related to the consensual nature of the judgment. If the Tribunal had reached the view that Seltsam was not liable to the plaintiff, the proposition that there might have been a negotiation to preserve James Hardie's rights would have been inappropriate, because Seltsam would have been entitled to enter judgment against the plaintiff without any need to engage in negotiation. 
     
      
    24 In Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2001] NSWCA 468, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales held that the entry of a judgment by consent in the Dust Diseases Tribunal should have been deferred, not because of the possibility of a negotiated outcome that would preserve the right of contribution, but because it was reasonable for the claimant tortfeasor to ask for more time to gather evidence to support the contribution claim, which would be extinguished by the entry of judgment. As in the Seltsam case, there was no issue in the Cockatoo Dockyard case as to the application of any limitation period. 
     
      
    25 In the Cockatoo Dockyard case Grove J (with whom Meagher JA and Ipp AJA agreed) observed at paragraph 23 that ""it is the entry of judgment .. which can extinguish a cross claimant's successful pursuit of any remedy"". In the present case the 10th and 11th defendants submit that I should defer the entry of judgment in favour of the first seven defendants until their application for summary dismissal or a stay of proceeding has been heard. However, the present case is distinguishable from Seltsam and Cockatoo Dockyard in that here, I have already delivered judgments expressing the considered conclusion, on the application of the first seven defendants for summary dismissal, that the plaintiff's claim against them is statute barred. This is not a case where the entry of judgment in favour of the first seven defendants would be the result of agreement or consent. There is no point in deferring the entry of judgment so that negotiations can take place, or so that the claimant tortfeasor's evidentiary case for contribution (as opposed to its evidentiary case for its own application for summary dismissal) can be more fully prepared. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion the submission by the 10th and 11th defendants is based on a false premise. The assumption seems to be that if I were to defer the entry of judgment until the outcome of their application for summary dismissal was known, the right of the 10th and 11th defendants to claim contribution might be improved. In my opinion that cannot be so. If I were to defer the entry of judgment and hear their application, and decide that they did not have a limitation defence, they would have no basis to resist the entry of judgment in favour of the first seven defendants. Their proper recourse would be to appeal against my determination. If I were to defer the entry of judgment and then decide that they had a limitation defence, the question of contribution would not arise (in the absence of a successful appeal by Clutha). 
     
      
    27 The 10th and 11th defendants have, by contesting the entry of judgment in favour of the first seven defendants, preserved such right as they may have to appeal against my determination. In its submissions Clutha has urged the Court to resolve the matter by entry of judgment, so that certainty is achieved and Clutha's right of appeal is crystallised. By entering judgment in favour of the first seven defendants I shall deliver certainty not only to Clutha but also to the 10th and 11th defendants, with respect to any appeal they may wish to make in order to preserve or restore their right of contribution. I shall endeavour to arrange for the 10th and 11th defendants' application for summary dismissal or stay to be heard expeditiously, but there is no basis for deferring entry of judgment in favour of the first seven defendants until determination of the application. 
     
      
    28 Therefore, subject to a matter to which I shall refer, my view is that, when I enter summary judgment in favour of the first seven defendants on the limitation ground, the 10th and 11th defendants will not be entitled to seek contribution from the first seven defendants under s 5 (1) (c), and there is no good reason for deferring the outcome. 
     
      
    29 The final matter which may qualify this conclusion relates to an anomaly not discussed by the High Court in Seltsam. The anomaly is, according to the submission by the 10th and 11th defendants, that s 26 the Limitation Act of New South Wales (the legislation which is the foundation of the first seven defendants' defence) proceeds on the basis that the contribution claim is not barred. Section 26 (1) provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""An action on a cause of action for contribution under s 5 (1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW) is not maintainable if brought after the first to expire of 
         
        (a) the limitation period of two years running from the date on which the cause of action for contribution first accrues to the plaintiff or to a person through whom he claims; and 
         
        (b) a limitation period of four years running from the date of the expiration of the limitation period for the principal cause of action."" 
        
       
      
    30 The 10th and 11th defendants submit that it ought not to be correct that s 14 of the Limitation Act would provide a statutory defence to the first seven defendants when s 26 has the effect that the limitation period for contribution claims has not expired against those same persons. In their contention, the more specific provision of s 26 ought to prevail, with the result that, notwithstanding the Seltsam decision, their right of contribution against the first seven defendants will not be extinguished by the entry of summary judgment for the first seven defendants against Clutha. 
     
      
    31 They say that such an anomaly was not intended by the legislature, and to support this argument they refer to the First Report on the Limitation of Actions (October 1967) by the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales, which led to the introduction of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW). They rely on part of paragraph 160 of the Report, where the Commissioners say: 
     
      
       
        
        ""From the point of view of the person against whom the claim for contribution is made, the possible period of 10 years which may run before the claim against him is statute barred is indeed a long period, but the situation is one in which, we think, the ultimate security of such a person ought to be delayed by reason of the inherent complexities attending the liability of the tortfeasor for contribution."" 
        
       
      
    32 The focus of the Commissioners' attention was to articulate a limitation period in substitution for the six-year limitation period for actions upon the case, which in the case of an action for contribution would commence to run in favour of the target tortfeasor only when the liability of the claimant tortfeasor was ascertained (paragraph 155). They considered whether to adopt the approach taken in the Limitation Act 1963 (UK), which sets a limitation period of two years running from the date upon which the liability of the claimant tortfeasor is ascertained. 
     
      
    33 One of the concerns of the Commissioners was that the UK limitation provision (like the general six-year limitation period for actions on the case) might be unfair to the target tortfeasor. This is because the limitation period in the target tortfeasor's favour does not commence to run until the happening of an event (namely the ascertainment of the claimant tortfeasor's liability) which may not happen for an indeterminate time after the happening of the facts making him liable as a tortfeasor, and is an event outside his control and possibly outside his knowledge (paragraph 158). 
     
      
    34 The solution to this problem, advocated by the Report, was to fix an independent limitation period expiring four years after the expiration of the limitation period for the tort victim's cause of action against the claimant tortfeasor. This would give the target tortfeasor the assurance of knowing that a claim for contribution against him would be statute barred no later than ten years after the events giving rise to tort liability, and earlier if the claimant tortfeasor's liability was ascertained more than two years before the expiration of that ten year period. 
     
      
    35 The Report seems to assume that an action will be available against the target tortfeasor at all relevant times, regardless of the application of any limitation period to the tort victim's claim against the target tortfeasor. For example, in paragraph 159 the following illustration is given of the operation of the four-year period: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Thus, if A sues B in tort for damages, and B wishes to claim contribution from C, B will either have a defence against A's action based on expiry of the limitation period or he will have at least four years in which to decide whether to claim contribution against C."" 
        
       
      
    36 The passage from paragraph 160 quoted and relied upon by the 10th and 11th defendants in their submission (and set out above) makes the same assumption. 
     
      
    37 It may be that the Commissioners made this assumption because of their interpretation of the High Court's decision in the Brambles case. In paragraph 154 they note the controversy on the question whether the words ""if sued"" have a temporal connotation, and they say that the controversy was set to rest by the High Court's decision in Brambles, the position being that the words ""if sued"" have no temporal connotation. That might have led the Commissioners to take the view that the application of a limitation period to the target tortfeasor's liability to the tort victim would have no consequences for the claimant tortfeasor, because the target tortfeasor would be a person who ""if sued"" at any time before the expiration of that limitation period would be liable, and so within the second limb of s 5 (1) (c). The majority judgments in Seltsam have established that this interpretation of the Brambles case is erroneous. It may therefore be that s 26 of the Limitation Act was enacted on an erroneous view of the operation of s 5 (1) (c) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. 
     
      
    38 In my view, s 26 does not impliedly amend s 5 (1) (c). Section 26 sets a limitation period for actions for contribution under s 5 (1), but it does not in terms vary the content of s 5 (1) (c) so as to enable an action for contribution to be brought in wider circumstances than are there specified. It does not state that an action brought within the period which it sets is maintainable, but only that an action brought outside that period is not maintainable. The joint judgment of Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Seltsam expressly contemplates (at 60) that the claimant tortfeasor's claim for compensation against the target tortfeasor fails if the tort victim is met by a good plea from the target tortfeasor that the action against it is time barred. Although the significance of s 26 does not appear to have been drawn to their Honours' attention, in my view s 26 cannot be used to qualify the clear statement of the law that emerges from the joint judgment. 
     
      
    39 The law is in a most unfortunate state. The High Court has made it emphatically clear that s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of New South Wales is in desperate need of reform, and there is no need for me to add my voice to their Honours' forceful observations. 
     
      
    40 I shall make an order for the summary dismissal of the proceeding against the first to seventh defendants. I shall hear the submissions of the parties with respect to costs, and make some orders for the case management of the application by the 10th and 11th defendants for the summary dismissal or a stay of the proceeding against them.

      Regina v Sallie Ann McGourty 
      
      
       
        
       The victim, a security guard, was robbed at gunpoint by a male offender. He was assaulted and forced into a vehicle by two male offenders the second of whom had a knife. Attempts were made to force him to disclose his PIN number and credit card details. The respondent drove the victim and the two male offenders into bushland and waited in the vehicle while the two male offenders took the victim into the bush where he was threatened and assaulted and later tied to a tree and abandoned. The police arrested the respondent in the motor vehicle. She was unco-operative with the police concerning the whereabouts of the victim or whether the co-offenders were armed. The respondent pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping, and received a two year suspended sentence. In sentencing, his Honour was asked to take into account an additional four matters on a Form 1. The crown appeals against sentence. 
       
      
      
       
       The sentence was manifestly inadequate 
       : 
        
       In view of the matters of aggravation and the matters on the Form 1, proper respect was not shown to the principle of totality, and His Honour allowed himself to be inappropriately swayed by the subjective circumstances. Subjective circumstances must be kept in perspective.

       Whether error in using two stage sentencing approach and suspending sentence 
       : 
        
       Both the instinctive synthesis approach and the two tiered approach, when properly employed, can produce a sentence which balances all of the relevant sentencing interests and principles. However, his Honour erred from the outset by selecting a starting point which failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the crime, by failing to make proper provision for the Form 1 offences, and by provision of cumulative credits for the subjective circumstances. In using the two tiered approach, it is critical that the final sentence is reviewed to ensure that as a whole, it is appropriate to the case at hand. His Honour neglected to do this.

       The case was not one for which a suspended sentence could properly have been imposed. It is not permissible to adjust a sentence downwards so as to allow it to be served in a non-custodial environment.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to S 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed by his Honour, Judge Goldring, at Wollongong District Court on 5 June 2002 following the respondent's plea of guilty to one count of kidnapping. That offence was committed contrary to the now repealed S 90A of the Crimes Act 1900 which, in the circumstances of this case, carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     2 In sentencing the respondent his Honour was asked to take into account additionally four matters on a Form 1. The sentence imposed was one of two years imprisonment backdated for one week and expiring on 28 May 2004, the remainder of which was suspended pursuant to S 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on condition that the respondent enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence. 
      
       
       Facts: 
       
     3 At about 6.45am on Monday, 5 March 2001 the victim, a 51 year old security guard from Sydney, completed his shift as the night guard at a building site in the suburb of Warrawong. He went to an ATM machine located in the Westfield Warrawong precinct where he withdrew a sum of money and then walked back to the construction site. En route he was attacked by a male offender who pointed a pistol at him and demanded money. He handed over the $200 in cash which he had taken from the ATM machine and was then escorted to an on-site toilet block where he was assaulted by that offender. 
      
       
     4 While there, further demands were made, which he refused. An on-site worker heard the commotion and went to investigate. He was similarly ordered into the toilet block at gunpoint.  
      
       
     5 A short time later another male offender, who was armed with a knife, arrived at the toilet block. After further demands, which were resisted, the two offenders ordered the on-site worker to the ground and then took the victim with them at gunpoint to a waiting vehicle which was driven by the respondent. 
      
       
     6 The victim was forced into the rear of the vehicle. He spoke to the respondent saying, ""Please release me, release me"". The respondent's reply was, ""Shut up, shut up"". He was then pushed down in a space behind the front seat and a blanket was placed over his head. He tried to get up because he could not breathe properly, but he was pushed down again. He was struck to the head on a number of occasions while being driven around for a lengthy period, during which further demands were made for his PIN number and credit cards. He was threatened with torture and death if he did not comply with these requests. 
      
       
     7 The respondent eventually drove the vehicle into dense bushland at Mount Kembla and waited in the vehicle while the two offenders took the victim into the bush. There he pleaded for his life. One of the male offenders broke his right wrist while tying his hands together. They then tied him to a tree with a rope, blindfolded him, taped his mouth, and abandoned him in the bush. Not surprisingly, he believed that he was likely to die. 
      
       
     8 The police were alerted by a neighbour and drove to the scene. Upon their arrival they observed the two male offenders walking from the bush. On seeing the police they turned and ran back into the bush. The respondent, however, was arrested in the motor vehicle. She did not provide any assistance to the police either as to the victim's whereabouts, or as to his condition, or as to whether the offenders were armed. She was conveyed to the Port Kembla Police Station. 
      
       
     9 The victim was eventually located by the Police Dog Squad. He was taken to Wollongong Hospital where he was admitted to surgery with respect to the fracture of his wrist. The detail of his injuries were set out in a certificate from the treating doctor and they were described as being of a serious nature. 
      
       
     10 Some $800 was taken from the victim by way of transactions using his ATM card between 6.18am and 7.19am that day. This sum was later found in the respondent's bag. 
      
       
     11 All four of the Form 1 offences were committed on 19 February 2001. They comprised offences of break and enter a building and commit a serious indictable offence contrary to S 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty, fourteen years imprisonment; the possession of housebreaking implements, contrary to S 114(1)(b) of the Crimes Act - maximum penalty, seven years imprisonment; having custody of a knife in a public place, contrary to S 11(C)(1) of the Summary Offences Act 1988 - maximum penalty for a first offence, a fine of $550; and enter prescribed premises without lawful excuse, contrary to S 4(1) of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 - maximum penalty, a fine of $1,100. 
      
       
     12 The circumstances which gave rise to these offences are as follows: At 2.35am on 19 February 2001 a security alarm was activated at the premises of the BHP in Unanderra. Security guards alerted by the alarm noticed a blue Commodore sedan parked close to bushes in a car park. They observed the respondent hiding in the bushes directly in front of the vehicle, about 100 metres inside the boundary of the premises. Upon being challenged, the respondent emerged from the bushes. Her co-offender managed to escape by climbing over a fence.  
      
       
     13 Two large screw drivers, a small shifting spanner, three mobile phones, two black shirts, a number of plastic bags, a Stanley knife, a SWISS army knife, two pairs of scissors, a roll of electrical tape and three webbed straps were located in a bag next to the respondent. Also located next to her was an IBM laptop computer which had been stolen from the BHP premises. A check of those premises revealed that a front door had been jemmied open. At the scene, the respondent refused to supply police with her details or with any details of the co-offender. The search of her bag revealed that it contained a knife. 
      
       
       Subjective Features of the Respondent: 
       
     14 The respondent was born in England and came to Australia with her family when she was four years of age. She was 41 years old at the time of the offences and had no previous convictions. She was unemployed and had previously been involved in an unstable marriage with a man who was allegedly part of a bikie gang and who had used alcohol and drugs excessively.  
      
       
     15 In 1996 she had developed hepatitis C. She was also said to have been suffering from asthma. Her husband's infidelity and their failure in a joint business venture led to her being diagnosed by her treating doctor as suffering from a depressive illness. 
      
       
     16 For 20 years or more, however, she had been a manager of a pharmacy in Armidale.  
      
       
     17 Shortly before these offences she had met the co-offender, Mark Jenkin, with whom she had apparently become infatuated and with whom she had moved to Wollongong. She became disillusioned with this relationship when she discovered that he was relapsing into drug abuse. Nevertheless she remained with him, on her account, because she did not have any money and because she was too ashamed to return to Armidale.  
      
       
     18 Since being charged she has apparently formed a new, supportive and committed relationship and his Honour concluded in those circumstances, having regard to her previous good character, that she had extremely good prospects of not re-offending. 
      
       
        
       The Appeal: 
        
       
     19 The Director of Public Prosecutions submits that his Honour erred in a number of respects and as a result arrived at a sentence which was manifestly lenient for a serious offence of kidnapping which carried a maximum sentence of 20 years, particularly having regard to the Form 1 offences. In answer to this proposition, Mr Berman SC drew our attention to the Judicial Commission's statistics which showed that, of the offenders who had been sentenced to full time custody for an offence of kidnapping, 22% had received a sentence of two years or less. At the other end of the scale, however, 27% of such offenders had received sentences of six years or more. So understood, and bearing in mind the wide range of objective and subjective circumstances seen in the cases included in the statistical sample, as well as the oft repeated caution that such tables are to be used with some care and are, in fact, less helpful than a review of decided cases (Regina v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734), this submission carries very little weight. 
      
       
     20 The sentencing exercise which his Honour was obliged to carry out needed to be considered in the light of the fact that the respondent had lent herself to a joint criminal enterprise whose objective criminality was very substantial, indeed towards the top of the range for an offence of the kind involved. In the course of it, the victim was seriously mistreated and subjected to an ordeal that could only have been terrifying, particularly having regard to the fact that it was prolonged.  
      
       
     21 The offence - leaving aside entirely the Form 1 matters for a moment - was aggravated by a number of factors including the circumstances that a pistol and knife were used; that the victim was threatened with death and torture; that he was repeatedly assaulted and sustained serious injury and eventually was abandoned in the bush and tied to a tree. He could very easily have lost his life.  
      
       
     22 Moreover, he was working in an occupation which left him particularly vulnerable to attack. As such, the present offence falls within that category of case which calls for a significant element of general deterrence: Regina v Thwaites NSWCCA 6 October 1993. 
      
       
     23 Kidnapping, it is additionally to be noted, has been said to be one of the most serious offences in the criminal calendar and is itself one where the need for general deterrence must prevail over subjective circumstances: See Regina v Elhalabi [2001] NSWCCA 516. His Honour distinguished that case upon the basis that the present respondent had not been involved in the planning of the offence. It was however a case which did not involve violence and where the maximum penalty available was fourteen years imprisonment. 
      
       
     24 So far as I can see, there was no factual basis for the finding made by his Honour beyond a self-serving and untested statement made by the respondent to a psychologist. Recently this Court has criticised the practice of placing material of this kind before sentencing judges, in an attempt to minimise the objective seriousness of a crime otherwise apparent on the face of a record: Regina v Quatami [2001] NSWCCA 353, at paras 58 and 59 per Smart AJ, and at para 79 per Spigelman CJ).  
      
       
     25 I whole heartedly agree with the criticism offered in that case. If an offender appearing for sentence wishes to place evidence before the court which is designed to minimise his/her criminality, then it should be done directly and in a form which can be tested.  
      
       
     26 Whether or not there was any degree of pre-planning to abduct the victim from his place of work if he failed to supply his credit cards and PIN numbers, seems to me, in any event, to be beside the point.  
      
       
     27 It is obvious that the respondent lent herself as a driver to an intended robbery. Although those who were involved in the planning of that offence may not have set out with any specific intention of abducting their victim, it is clear that when resistance was offered, each of the offenders, including the respondent, decided that this is what should occur. Thereafter the respondent rejected the victim's requests for help and she willingly drove him and the two assailants to a remote location and knowingly left him there.  
      
       
     28 If as the respondent suggested the kidnapping was in fact a spontaneous event on the part of all offenders, then there was no proper basis for distinguishing between them on the ground that the other offenders, but not the respondent, involved themselves in a premeditated plan to abduct the victim.  
      
       
     29 While it may be accepted that the respondent's objective criminality was not as great as those who actually threatened and assaulted the victim, it remained significantly high. In summary, she was part of a serious joint enterprise. She did not withdraw from it, and she added her own contribution in telling the victim to be quiet when he pleaded for his life.  
      
       
     30 She has demonstrated no remorse or contrition for the offence. Moreover, her initial response to Constable Wiggins was totally uncooperative and clearly designed to mislead police, even though later she did disclose that the victim had been left in the bush. 
      
       
     31 In view of the several matters of aggravation identified, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 which should have been reflected in the sentence by way of some additional punishment, if proper respect was to be shown to the principle of totality in accordance with the decisions of this Court in Regina v Morgan [1993] 70 A Crim R 368; Regina v Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5; and Regina v Bavadra [2000] 115 A Crim R152. I am driven to the clear conclusion that error, in principle, has been shown.  
      
       
     32 I can only conclude that his Honour allowed himself to form an unduly favourable assessment of the respondent's criminality and also to be inappropriately swayed by her subjective circumstances involving, as they did, the plea of guilty; her previous good character; the somewhat chaotic earlier lifestyle into which she had fallen; and the prospect of rehabilitation in the presence of a more supportive relationship.  
      
       
     33 In relation to her earlier lifestyle, I do observe that she was a mature woman who was able to determine her own destiny. I do not see that she can claim anything by way of mitigation, in choosing to associate herself with a member of a bikie group and thereby to descend into activities involving criminality. To assume that she was a vulnerable and defenseless person unable to think for herself does her a disservice and involves something of an overstatement.  
      
       
     34 Clearly it was a necessary and appropriate for his Honour to take the subjective matters into account, but they had to be kept in perspective. They should not have become the reason for imposing a sentence which, in my view, was weakly merciful and which did not properly reflect the objectives of punishment, retribution and deterrence, both general and personal.  
      
       
     35 The result, so it seems to me, was to produce a sentence - whether suspended or not - that was not reasonably proportionate to the crime. Rather, it was of the kind which offends the principles enunciated in decisions such as Regina v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 and the earlier decision in Regina v Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594. 
      
       
     36 I do accept that before the court can intervene in a Crown appeal it must be satisfied of the existence of either patent or latent error of law. More is required than the conclusion that, if the court was itself sentencing at first instance, it would have taken a different approach. It is for that reason, that Crown appeals need to be approached with special care. See Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 and Regina v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2. 
      
       
     37 I am, however, satisfied that error has here been disclosed in that the sentence was so disproportionate to the objective criminality, after taking into account the subjective circumstances, that error of law must be assumed. 
      
       
     38 It was submitted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, independently of the foregoing, that his Honour erred in adopting a two-stage sentencing process, instead of an intuitive approach, and in deciding that the sentence was one that could properly be suspended.  
      
       
     39 As to the former, it appears that his Honour began with a calculation that the kidnapping offence was such that the co-offenders should have received sentences in the range of seven to ten years, which he then reduced to three years in the case of the respondent by reason of an implicit assessment, that their criminality was more than twice as serious as hers. That sentence he then reduced to two and a half years for her previous good character, and then to two years by allowing a 20 percent discount, on the reduced sentence, for the plea of guilty.  
      
       
     40 In my view, this approach disclosed error, from the outset in so far as it involved the selection of a starting point, which failed significantly to reflect the objective seriousness of the respondent's involvement in the crime. 
      
       
     41 It was then followed, in my view, by a failure to make proper provision for the Form 1 offences to which, at best, lip service seems to have been given, and finally by the provision of cumulative credits for the subjective circumstances.  
      
       
     42 Support for the instinctive synthesis approach of sentencing is not confined to the dissenting judgment of McHugh J in AB v The Queen (1999) 108 CLR 101, nor is it necessarily inconsistent with an approach that first assesses the objective gravity of the offence, and then considers the subjective features which operate in mitigation. 
      
       
     43 The proper approach to these matters was helpfully analysed by the Spigelman CJ in Regina v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 396 to 403. What has to be achieved, by which ever method of sentencing is adopted, is a sentence which, in the end, pays proper regard to and ensures a proper balance of, all of the relevant sentencing interests and principles. Both the instinctive synthesis approach and the two-tiered approach, when properly employed, can produce that result. 
      
       
     44 However with a two-tiered approach, care has to be taken that the arithmetic exercise applied, particularly where a discount is made cumulative upon another discount, does not end up distorting the process. Sentencing never has been, and cannot be, reduced to a simple arithmetic process; Pearce v The Queen (1998) 108 CLR 610.  
      
       
     45 If the two-tiered approach is used, with the obvious advantage which it has, of focusing upon a starting point sentence which would reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, and adjusting it for the subjective circumstances, it is critical that the final sentence then be reviewed to ensure that as a whole, it is appropriate to the case in hand. In this case it appears to me that his Honour neglected that final step.  
      
       
     46 Additionally I am persuaded that the case was not one for which a suspended sentence could properly have been imposed. First, that option is only available where a sentence of not more than two years was appropriate: S 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The present is not such a case, in my view, for the reasons mentioned. It was accordingly not to the point, notwithstanding the respondent's submissions that, for reasons not involving any fault on her part, community service, periodic detention and home detention were considered to be unavailable options at the time of sentencing. To have gone down a peg for that reason would have constituted sentencing error. The clear duty of his Honour was to impose an appropriate sentence to reflect the objective and subjective circumstances and not to adjust the sentence downwards so as to permit it to be served outside a custodial environment. In this regard I would adopt the observations of Howie J in Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at para 32: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of the sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     47 The case of Regina v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 21, which was relied upon by the respondent as support for the adoption of a non-custodial option, provides no assistance. That was very much a case dependent on subjective circumstances unique to the two offenders. Each was an immature young man who had been involved as a junior partner in a very serious enterprise, who had demonstrated a remarkable level of rehabilitation, who had admitted his offence immediately, who had assisted the authorities and had demonstrated geneuine remorse. By reason of their assistance, one would have been required to serve any sentence on protection, and the other offender was subject to the special provisions of the Children (Criminal Procedings) Act 1987.  
      
       
     48 The purpose for which sentences can properly be suspended, and the sentencing exercise which should be followed were noted in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] 175 ALR 315, Regina v JCE [2000] NSWCCA 498 and recently, and most helpfully, in Regina v Zamagias.  
      
       
     49 The personal considerations applicable to the respondent, when considered in the light of the very serious objective features of her crime, would not, in my view, in accordance with those decisions, have justified an order for suspension, even if a sentence for two years had been appropriate. 
      
       
     50 For these reasons I am persuaded that manifest leniency has been demonstrated to the point where error of law has been established. In view of the extent of that leniency, the case is not one which permits an exercise of the discretion attaching to Crown appeals. 
      
       
     51 Making due allowance for the principle of double jeopardy, I would propose that the appeal be allowed, that the sentence below be varied and that the respondent be sentenced, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, to imprisonment for three years to date from 5 June 2002 and to expire on 4 June 2005. I consider it appropriate to backdate to the date upon which sentence was imposed by his Honour, in order to make allowance for the eight days presentence custody, and also for the fact that the respondent has been serving a suspended sentence for approximately 9 weeks, subject to a bond. 
      
       
     52 I would find special circumstances to exist relating to the personal problems which had confronted the respondent at the time of the offences, to her medical condition, and to the assessment that she has favourable prospects of rehabilitation which would be advanced by an extended opportunity for supervision on parole. 
      
       
     53 I would accordingly fix a non-parole period of two years also to date from 5 June 2002 and to expire on 4 June 2004. Upon expiry of that non-parole period, I would direct the release of the respondent on parole on the standard conditions, in accordance with S 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
      
       
     54 GILES JA: I agree.55 LEVINE J: I agree.56 GILES JA: Those will be the orders of the Court.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Dunford J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by the late Acting Judge Ford QC in the District Court at Campbelltown on 6 April 2000, following the Applicant’s pleas of guilty before the Magistrate and committal for sentence pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act 1902.  
      
       
     2 The charges were two counts of robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years, one count of robbery contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 14 years, and one count of use offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension contrary to s 33B(a) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 12 years. There was also a matter on the Form 1 of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty. 
      
       
     3 The two robberies in company were committed on 27 April and 25 May 1999, both at the Caltex Service Station at Minto. The robbery was at the Five Star Supermarket at Bradbury on 18 July 1999 and the use of the offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension occurred later that same day when the Applicant was chased and caught following the robbery.  
      
       
     4 The facts of various matters were as follows. On Tuesday 27 April 1999 at about 12.10 am the console operator at Minto Caltex Service Station saw three males walking towards the store, one of whom was the Applicant. They entered the store and after a time the console operator walked over to serve the Applicant and the other male, and when he did so he found that the third male had climbed under the counter and was holding a knife approximately 15cm in length in his right hand. He waved the knife in front of the console operator and ordered him to open the till draw. The console operator did so, whereupon the Applicant jumped up onto the counter on his knees and removed the cash from the register. The amount was estimated at $520. The Applicant and the other two males then ran from the store. 
      
       
     5 On 25 May 1999 at about 5.15 am the same console operator was working in the same service station when he saw the Applicant and another male enter the service station. He was requested to call a taxi and walked over to the phone within the service area and attempted to do so. While doing so he had his back turned to the Applicant and the other male when he heard the buttons to the cash register being pushed. He turned around to see the Applicant kneeling on the counter on his knees with a knife approximately 15cm in length in his right hand. He put the phone down and walked toward the Applicant who pointed the knife towards him whereupon he retreated. The Applicant opened the cash register and removed the cash notes from inside, taking an estimated $470. The other male was standing next to the Applicant on the other side of the counter and ordered the console operator to hand over his wallet. He had $10 in his wallet which he handed over to the other male. Both of them then left the store. The console operator was able to identify the Applicant as the person who had committed the robbery one month earlier, and he was later identified from video footage in relation to these robberies.  
      
       
     6 On 3 August after being arrested for the other matters, the Applicant viewed the surveillance video footage of these robberies and identified himself to police as the person depicted making full admissions. He stated that the offences had been committed to support his drug addiction. 
      
       
     7 On Sunday, 18 July 1999 at about 2.50pm the Applicant went to the Five Star Supermarket at Bradbury at the shopping centre and when passing over payment for a packet of chewing gum he reached over the counter, pushed the check-out operator away, reached into the till and took $220 in cash from the cash register. He then ran from the store. The check-out operator raised the alarm, the store owner gave chase and after some time was joined in the pursuit by another member of the public. The Applicant turned around and confronted the two pursuers saying “I have a blood filled needle and Hep C and I’ll stab you if you come near me”.  
      
       
     8 The Applicant then ran down the road continuing to be pursued by the storeowner and the other person. At about this time another male joined in the chase and gave assistance. The three of them managed to apprehend the Applicant, a struggle ensued and at this stage the Applicant produced a hypodermic syringe which he held in his right hand and said, “I have a needle I have Hep C I’ll stab you with it I’ve got a broken arm let me go”. He continued to make threats towards his captors whilst they waited for the police to arrive.  
      
       
     9 When police did arrive they saw the Applicant holding a syringe in his right hand. They directed the Applicant to release the syringe on a number of occasions which he refused to do. Police joined in the struggle and eventually the syringe was prised free from the Applicant’s grasp. The Applicant was arrested and participated in an electronically recorded interview admitting the robbery and again stated that the reason for committing the offence was to support his heroin addiction and that he had been addicted to heroin for 7 years, using every other day. 
      
       
     10 The Applicant was born on 14 December 1975, he was therefore aged 23½ years at the time of the offences and 24½ years at the time of sentencing. According to the Pre-Sentence Report he was the eldest of four children from a close and supportive family. However, on reaching adolescence he began associating with a delinquent peer group, leading to anti-social behaviour and eventual entry into Boys Town as a boarder at the age of 14. The family remained supportive but frustrated with his continuing drug problem. He was educated to Year 10 and he and his partner of 6 years, who also remains supportive, have three children who were at the time of sentencing aged 6, 4 and 1 respectively. The Applicant has not worked since 1997. 
      
       
     11 He has an extensive criminal record dating back to 1992 when he was aged 16. His convictions include larceny, break enter and steal, obtain benefit by deception, robbery, malicious damage, possess prohibited drug and drive in a manner dangerous. Following successful appeals to the District Court he was on 29 May 1998 effectively sentenced to a minimum term of 3 months to date from 24 March 1998 with an additional term of 5 months. According to the Pre-sentence Report he was released on parole on 24 June 1998 with his parole order due to expire 23 November 1998. Due to his failure to abide by his parole conditions and drug abuse his parole was revoked as from 11 July 1998, but he was re-paroled on 13 October 1998 with a further parole condition to enter the Odyssey House Drug Rehabilitation Program. He failed to do so, his parole was again revoked on 23 October 1988, he was returned to custody on 1 November 1998 and served the remainder of his term and also a further sentence of 2 months to date from 31 October 1998 for shoplifting and enter enclosed land. He was finally released from custody on 24 January 1999 and the first of these offences were committed approximately 3 months later.  
      
       
     12 It appears that he began using cannabis at about age 13 and at age 18 he began experimenting with heroin. Following a motor vehicle accident in 1995 his use of this substance increased dramatically due to his inability to work and boredom. He was briefly admitted to a Methadone Program in 1996 but discharged after 3 weeks. He has also been using Rohypnol since age 11. He stated that prior to his incarceration he was using up to 3 grams of heroin a day as well as taking 20 tablets of Rohypnol. Since his incarceration he has been admitted to the Methadone Program admittedly on 120 milligrams a day and at the time of sentencing was withdrawing from methadone and was in receipt of 90 milligrams a day. He told Dr Westmore the heroin might cost him up to $600 a day.  
      
       
     13 Dr Westmore was of the opinion that he had a significant and long term substance abuse problem and probably in addition some personality difficulties with possibly anxious and dependent traits, but he did not consider that he had a anti-social personality disorder. He considered that he required an extended period of rehabilitation from a psychiatric perspective and it would be best if some or all of this were in a community-based situation. Dr Westmore considered his prognosis very uncertain as he had not had any extended rehabilitation in the past and his drug misuse history was quite chronic. 
      
       
     14 His Honour took all these matters into account and then imposed sentences expressed as follows:  
      
       
       1. for the robberies in company at the service station on 27 April and 25 May 1999, imprisonment for 3 years, the sentences to be served concurrently.  
        
       2. for the robbery at the supermarket in Bradbury on 18 July 1999, imprisonment for 2 years to be served concurrently with the other sentences already imposed. 
        
       3. for using the offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension a consecutive or cumulative term of 2 years. His Honour went on saying: 
        
         
          
           
           “And in your case the non-parole period will be, having regard to the cumulative sentence, a period of 5 years.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     15 His Honour backdated the commencement of the 5 years to 18 July 1999, the date on which the Applicant had been taken into custody. He found “special circumstances” in the need for a protracted period of supervision for rehabilitation and went on:  
      
       
        
         
         “the period to be served after the non-parole periods a term of 3 years and the whole of the term of the sentence will expire on 17 July 2007”. 
         
        
       
     16 His Honour therefore clearly had in mind that the Applicant should serve a total of 5 years in gaol before being eligible for parole and that thereafter there be a further period of 3 years during which he would be eligible for parole. 
      
       
     17 An initial problem arises because of the manner in which the sentences were expressed. Under the Sentencing Act 1989 s 5, the Judge was required to first set a minimum term of imprisonment that the person was required to serve for the offence and secondly to set an additional term during which the person could be released on parole. Although s 6 permitted the setting of fixed terms in specified circumstances, one of which was because of other sentences imposed on the offender, when he did so the Court was required to state the reason for its decision to set a fixed term.  
      
       
     18 That Act had however been repealed and replaced by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as from 3 April 2000, 3 days before the Applicant was sentenced. That Act requires that when sentencing an offender to imprisonment the Court is required; firstly, to set the total term of the sentence and then, to set a non-parole period (i.e. the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence): s 44, R v Carrion [2000] NSWCCA 191, 49 NSWLR 149 at para [15].  
      
       
     19 Section 45 authorises a Court to decline to set a non-parole period in various circumstances including because of any other penalty previously imposed on the offender, for any other reason that the Court considers sufficient. Subsection (2) provides that if the Court declines to set a non-parole period it must make a record of its reasons for doing so but subs (4) further provides that the failure to do so does not invalidate the sentence. In my opinion it is apparent that his Honour’s reason for not fixing non-parole periods in respect of the three robbery offences was that his Honour was intending to allow for the Applicant’s release on parole by fixing a non-parole period in respect of the other matter. It would have been more appropriate and more correct to have fixed the sentence with the non-parole period first so that the omission to fix non-parole periods for the other sentences could be brought under s 45(1)(b) rather than s 45(1)(c) but subs(4) prevents the sentence being invalid in that regard. 
      
       
     20 But his Honour clearly failed to comply with s 44(1) by fixing a non-parole period first and then a further period, described as the “parole period”, to make up the whole of the sentence. There is no such thing in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as a “parole period” as there was an “additional term” in the Sentencing Act, although for the sake of convenience, that expression is often used. 
      
       
     21 His Honour quite clearly intended that the robbery offences between them should carry concurrent sentences of 3 and 2 years respectively without any non-parole periods and that the offence of using an offensive weapon to avoid lawful apprehension should carry a further sentence, cumulative on the robbery sentences, of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years giving rise to an effective overall sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. As I say, his Honour failed to comply with s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act by fixing the non-parole period first, but in my opinion this Court has ample power to readjust the sentences pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and/or s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to rectify any errors in the manner the sentences were expressed; and the real question for this Court is whether a total sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 3 years is outside the range of a proper sentencing discretion for the offences to which the Applicant pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     22 The charges of robbery in company and armed robbery are both offences contrary to s 97(1) and both carry a maximum penalty of 20 years; therefore, although not strictly applicable, R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 provides a useful guide. That case takes account of pleas of guilty, although an early plea, as was the case here, will justify a larger discount: R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383. On the other hand here there were not only the two robberies in company, quite separate offences committed 4 weeks apart, but another robbery some 8 weeks later, followed by the use of the offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension. These two latter offences were committed on the same day and one followed the other, but they were in fact separate and discrete offences of a different nature; and so each of those four offences justified a cumulative sentence. It was of course necessary to have regard to the principle of totality but by the Judge making all the robbery sentences concurrent, the Applicant received a substantial benefit.  
      
       
     23 In addition to that, the Applicant had a bad criminal record, including previous convictions for robbery and break, enter and steal. Some factors of the offence were matters of aggravation such as the fact that the service station was robbed at night when the console operator was particularly vulnerable, and the threat of the HIV virus was of particular apprehension to a number of people: see R v Stone (1995) 85 A Crim R 436 at 439 where Sully J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I think that it has to be understood that, whether rightly or wrongly, many, many people of good sense and good will, who are normally able to exercise reasonable, sensible, discriminating judgments have a deeply rooted, absolutely convinced, and almost boundless, terror of AIDS and of the HIV virus. It is not to the point, it seems to me, to debate, in a detailed kind of way, whether it is logical for such people to entertain such fears. The nature of the disease, its apparent incurability, the appalling consequences that it has to the lives of people who are infected with it, all have produced among decent, upright, law-abiding citizens a genuine terror of, and indeed revulsion towards, the disease.  
          
         That environment creates, as this case itself demonstrates, an opportunity for those who are disposed to take advantage of it, to exploit those terrors and apprehensions of their fellow citizens in the commission of crimes of one kind or another. It simply cannot be permitted to continue; and if, in order to stamp it out, condign sentences have to be imposed at the primary sentencing level, and upheld on appeal, then, whether fashionable or not, that is what will have to be done.” 
         
        
       
     24 Reference was made to the Applicant’s drug addiction and we were referred to the principles relating to the effect of drug addiction in relation to charges such as the present contained in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWR 346 at para [273]. Reference was made to the Applicant’s drug addiction, this is not an excuse or a mitigating factor of itself although it can be, and in this case is, a subjective factor which tends to explain the Applicant’s reason for committing the offences, their impulsiveness and, particularly in relation to the Bradbury matter, the lack of pre-planning. It is also relevant in considering his prospects of rehabilitation, which in view of his past history, are not particularly encouraging. It was also necessary in considering the sentences to be imposed for his Honour to make some allowance for the additional matter he was taking into account in the Form 1, see R v Morgan (1993) 78 A Crim R 368 at 371-2, Hunt CJ at CL, R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63 at paras [54]-[64] per Carruthers AJ and cases there cited. 
      
       
     25 Taking all these matters into account I am of the opinion that the total sentences imposed in the present case were not outside the proper range of a valid sentencing discretion; but because his Honour failed to have regard to the provisions of the new Act it is necessary to re-sentence the Applicant. In doing so the Court can have regard to matters that have occurred since the original sentence was imposed. Generally these are matters relating to the Applicant’s conduct and attempts at rehabilitation whilst in gaol, but in the present case there are subsequent convictions, namely escape from lawful custody, and shoplifting; and it is conceded that the Court can have regard to these matters.  
      
       
     26 Notwithstanding that, I would not increase the effective sentences but our attention has been drawn to the fact that the Applicant was at liberty for 49 days following his escape. In the normal course, if the appeal was simply dismissed, this period of 49 days (street time) would be added onto the end of his current sentence, but there appears to be considerable doubt as to whether it would be added on if we simply backdated the sentences to the original commencing date and it is conceded that it would not be inappropriate to advance the commencement date of the sentences by 49 days and make it clear that in doing so we have taken account of the time the Applicant has been at liberty since the original sentences were imposed.  
      
       
     27 I therefore propose the following orders: Grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentences imposed and re-sentence the Applicant as follows: 
      
       
       In respect of each of the robberies in company imprisonment for 3 years, the sentences to be concurrent and be deemed to have commenced on 2 September 1999. In respect of the robbery at Bradbury and taking into account the matter on the Form 1 and in respect of the use of an offensive weapon to prevent apprehension, imprisonment for 5 years to commence on 2 September 2002, such sentences to be concurrent with each other but cumulative to the sentences imposed in respect of the service station robberies. In respect of these last mentioned offences I would fix a non-parole period of 2 years so that the earliest date on which the Applicant would be eligible for release on parole would be 1 September 2004. I would have it noted “street time” of 49 days following the Applicant’s escape from lawful custody has been taken into account in fixing the commencement dates of the sentences for the robberies as 2 September 1999 rather than 18 July 1999, the date on which the Applicant was taken into custody. 
        
       
     28 Carruthers AJ: I agree with Dunford J.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 Dunford J: This is an application by Adam Christopher Dorsett for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him by Blanch CJ/DC on 7 December 2000, following pleas of guilty to six charges of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which provides for a maximum penalty of 20 years. His Honour was also asked when dealing with the first count to take into account five further charges, four more of armed robbery and one of demand money with menaces.  
      
       
     2 In respect of each of the offences, including the first count on which the other matters were taken into account, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with non-parole periods of 8 years, the sentences to be concurrent and to date from 4 April 2000, the date on which the Applicant was arrested. In sentencing the Applicant the learned sentencing Judge noted that all the offences were committed between 6 and 30 March 2000 and were related and explained by the fact that the Applicant was a heroin addict who was desperate for money to feed his addiction; and in brief what the Applicant did was to arm himself with a knife, go into various business premises and threaten employees with the knife in order to obtain cash. In most, if not all of the cases, the knife was pointed at, or at least shown to, the victim. What made the case more serious was that at the time he committed the offences the Applicant was on parole for similar offences.  
      
       
     3 He was born on 24 June 1968 and accordingly is now 34 years old. His criminal record dates back to July 1982 and includes convictions for stealing, possess housebreaking implements, possess and administer prohibited drug, and on 6 April 1990 in the District Court at Sydney he was convicted of break, enter and steal, escape lawful custody, armed robbery, and armed robbery with wounding, and sentenced to effective terms totalling a minimum term of 9 years to date from 6 October 1989 with an additional term of 2 years; thus he was on parole at the time of these offences. 
      
       
     4 A number of submissions were made on behalf of the Applicant. Firstly, it was submitted that, having regard to the fact that the maximum sentence for armed robbery is 20 years, the notional sentence of 15 years imprisonment for offences of this nature (which was his Honour’s starting point before allowing a discount for the pleas of guilty) was excessive. That submission would undoubtedly be justified if there had been only one offence, but here there are six separate counts plus four matters on the Form 1. Furthermore, as pointed out in R v Harris [2001] NSWCCA 332 at [23] - [29] where reference is made to R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368, R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63, 121 A Crim R 185 and R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292, 115 A Crim R 152, a judge taking matters into account pursuant to a Form 1 must impose a sentence which gives due recognition to the gravity of the additional offences by increasing the penalty which would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence charged.  
      
       
     5 His Honour failed to impose separate discrete sentences for each offence as required by Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, but if he had done so, and bearing in mind the Applicant’s prior record and the fact that the sentences were committed whilst on parole, a starting point of not less than 8 years for the first count (including the Form 1 matters) and 5 years on each of the other counts could not have been considered excessive. It would then have been necessary to have regard to the principle of totality by making some of the sentences wholly or partly concurrent with each other. The same result has been achieved and the principle of totality given effect to by fixing the starting point of 15 years for all the offences combined, rather than one in excess of 30 years. The Applicant has not been disadvantaged by his Honour’s approach in this regard. 
      
       
     6 Reference was also made to the fact that these were said to be offences without any actual violence but this overlooks the fact that the production of the knife involved the threat of violence, and it was the threat of violence by the use of the knife which induced the victims to part with the money. On a number of occasions the Applicant threatened the victim that he would use the knife unless he was given the money; the threat of violence was the whole purpose of producing the knife. It is not necessary to elaborate on the need when sentencing for offences such as these to have regard to the need to protect members of the public, general and personal deterrence, retribution and denunciation of the offences along with the community’s abhorrence of the use of guns and knives to commit criminal offences. 
      
       
     7 Next it was submitted that in allowing a deduction for the pleas of guilty at the first opportunity, his Honour allowed what was described as a “common deduction” of 25% from the notional sentence (in fact it was 20%), but in view of the early pleas and other personal circumstances of the Applicant, his Honour could have appropriately reduced the sentence by a greater amount. R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383 requires a discount for early pleas of guilty and suggests a range. This discount (20%) was towards the higher end of the range, and in at least two instances the Applicant was captured on video enabling him to be identified and resulting in a strong Crown case. In another matter, the Bradbury robbery, he was chased and in effect caught red handed.  
      
       
     8 Moreover, the test is not whether the sentencing Judge “could have” allowed a larger discount for the pleas of guilty, but whether the discount, either alone or in conjunction with other factors has led to a sentence which was “manifestly excessive”. In my view the discount allowed for the early pleas of guilty was well within the range of a proper sentencing discretion.  
      
       
     9 It was next submitted that having reduced the sentences to 12 years on account of the pleas of guilty, and having found “special circumstances” thus enabling him to reduce the non-parole period below the 75% specified in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour only reduced the period by 1 year whereas he could “appropriately have reduced the non-parole period by 2 or 3 years, rather than by 1 year only”. Once again, the issue for this Court is not whether the sentencing Judge “could have” fixed a lesser non-parole period, but whether in all the circumstances the non-parole period fixed has led to a sentence which is “manifestly excessive”.  
      
       
     10 Our attention was directed to the fact that having regard to his age and the previous and current sentences imposed on the Applicant, by the time of his release he will be approximately aged 40 and have served virtually the whole of his adult life in gaol, leading to a very real prospect of him becoming institutionalised and finding it more difficult to cope with civilian life. Emphasis was placed on the fact that although he received a lengthy sentence on the last occasion, and rightly so, he made a genuine effort on his release to overcome his drug addiction by getting a job, undertaking a methadone program and forming a relationship. However, when he lost his job through no fault of his own and his partner left him, he returned to his drug-addicted life which led to the commission of the current offences whilst he was on parole. It was noted that he is doing his best whilst in gaol and there is some real prospect he may do better on his ultimate release.  
      
       
     11 However, his Honour’s reasons for reducing the non-parole period centred around these very matters, particularly the need for a lengthy period under supervision on parole to assist the Applicant to resettle into civilian life after such a lengthy period in prison with the attendant risk of him becoming institutionalised and for the prospect of him being rehabilitated in respect of his drug abuse at a later stage. In view of what happened after his most recent release from prison the latter consideration suggests the triumph of hope over experience; but in any event if he cannot adjust to civilian life and overcome his drug addiction with 4 years parole under supervision, it is highly speculative to suggest that he could be any more successful over a longer period.  
      
       
     12 In addition, the non-parole period needs to reflect the minimum term which, having regard to the objective criminality and the relevant subjective features, is the minimum period which the Applicant should serve in full time custody for the offences involved: Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 referred to in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534. Having regard to the number and gravity of the offences and the other circumstances referred to I would not regard the non-parole period as excessive.  
      
       
     13 Reference was made to the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 and the various criteria that generally relate to offences of armed robbery, but Henry is hardly relevant to the present case because it deals with a single offence whereas here there are six offences plus the matters on the Form 1, and moreover this is not a young offender with little or no criminal history; he is not young, he has an extensive criminal history and was on parole at the time of the commission of these offences.  
      
       
     14 Reference was also made to the Applicant’s heroin addiction but the authorities on the effect of such an addiction were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in Henry at [273]-[274] where his Honour pointed out that the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit is not an excuse to commit armed robberies or any similar offence and, of itself, is not a matter of mitigation, although it may be relevant in considering the objective criminality of the offences as it may demonstrate impulsivity or lack of planning, and in a subjective sense it may be relevant as to the prospects of rehabilitation. It may also be relevant in other respects, not relevant to this case. In my view, consistently with such principles, the learned sentencing judge gave the drug addiction of the Applicant the appropriate weight. As Wood CJ at CL pointed out in Henry at [274], to accept drug addiction as a mitigating factor generally would not be justified in principle, and it would involve an exercise in irresponsibility on the part of the Court if it were understood as a message that committing the crime of armed robbery to feed a drug habit is less deserving of censure than would otherwise be the case.  
      
       
     15 Finally, it was submitted that in respect of any of the individual offences, including the matters on the Form 1, a notional sentence of 15 years, an actual head sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years was excessive and reference was made to R v Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5; but as Simpson J pointed out in that case at [3], that does not necessarily mean that the total effective sentence imposed for all of these offences with its non-parole period is beyond the range of a proper sentencing discretion.  
      
       
     16 Having regard to all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that for this combination of offences committed by the Applicant whilst on parole, and allowing for his early pleas of guilty, a total effective sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years was excessive, neither as to the head sentence nor as to the non-parole period but, having regard to the principles laid down in Pearce, it is conceded by the Crown that it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence, fixing discrete sentences for each offence. 
      
       
     17 I would therefore grant leave to appeal, I would quash the sentences and in lieu thereof sentence the Applicant as follows:- 
      
       
       On each of counts 2 to 6 inclusive, a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years, the sentences to be partly concurrent and partly cumulative and to commence and expire as follows: 
        
       Count 2: 4 April 2000 to 3 April 2004 
        
       Count 3: 4 April 2001 to 3 April 2005 
        
       Count 4: 4 April 2002 to 3 April 2006 
        
       Count 5: 4 April 2003 to 3 April 2007 
        
       Count 6: 4 April 2004 to 3 April 2008. 
        
       On count 1, and taking into account the matters on Form 1, a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years, such sentence also to be partly concurrent and partly cumulative with the other sentences and to commence on 4 April 2005 and expire on 3 April 2012. In respect of this last mentioned sentence I would fix a non-parole period of 3 years also commencing 4 April 2005, the special circumstances within s 44(2) of the  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
        being the need for a prolonged period of supervision on parole and the accumulation of sentences. The earliest date on which the Applicant would therefore be eligible for release on parole would be 3 April 2008. 
        
       
     18 Carruthers AJ: I agree with Dunford J.
