 Introduction 
 
 
 
(a) Background
The plaintiffs (`Pertamina`), an Indonesian state enterprise, were created by Law No 8 of 1971 of the Republic of Indonesia. Their principal business was and is the exploration, processing and marketing of oil and natural gas and related projects. Being a dominant economic force in Indonesia at all material times, they also undertook major economic development projects at the direction of the government of the Republic of Indonesia and one such project was the construction of the infrastructure facilities for a massive steel works known as Krakatau Steel at Cilegon, West Java. Those steel works were owned and eventually operated by a company known as PT Krakatau Steel (`PTKS`) created on 31 August 1970 by Law No 8 of 1970. For the purposes of these proceedings, the contractors which constructed the infrastructure and provided the materials and services under several contracts signed in 1973 and 1974 in respect of the steel works and the infrastructure for the industrial site at Cilegon, West Java, Indonesia were Klockner Industrie Analagen GMBH (`Klockner`) and Siemens AG (`Siemens`). Another was Pertamina`s involvement in and their payments for the purchases of equipment in relation to two projects in the Batam Island, of which a little more will be said later.
General Haji Achmad Thahir (`General Thahir`) was employed by Pertamina and their statutory predecessors. During the period directly and more immediately material to these proceedings he held the office as the general assistant to the then president director of Pertamina, General Ibnu Sutowo (`General Sutowo`). He was appointed to that office with effect from 14 October 1968 until 23 July 1976 when he died, having succumbed to a heart attack. At all material times his salary totalled only about US$9,000 per year. By para 3 of the reamended statement of claim it is asserted that from at least June 1972 until his death, General Thahir `was authorized to contract` on behalf of Pertamina and/or by virtue of his position in Pertamina also on behalf of PTKS `and to deal with all ancillary matters including the negotiation and implementation of financial arrangements` in connection with principally the Krakatau steel project. Pertamina further assert that it was within his power and authority to arrange for creditors (including Klockner and Siemens) of the plaintiffs and PTKS to be paid. The last assertion of fact in para 3 of the reamended statement of claim is that General Thahir, by virtue of his relationship with General Sutowo, was in a position of influence with General Sutowo, particularly in relation to matters involving the construction works and the supply of goods and materials.
(b) 19 ACU deposits
It turned out that on 23 July 1976, when General Thahir died, there stood as having been deposited with the Singapore branch of the Sumitomo Bank, 17 separate and discrete ACU deposits denominated in Deutschmarks, all in the name of `Mr HA Thahir and/or Mrs KR Thahir`; their aggregate was DM53,972,374.12 and as from 23 July 1976 their maturity dates ranged between a few days and just over four months. In addition, there were two other separate and discrete ACU deposits, one on time deposit to mature on 18 August 1976 and the other on demand, which were denominated in US dollars in the sums of US$593,249.31 and US$608,959.42 respectively. These two ACU deposits totalled US$1,202,208.73. All these ACU deposits have to be analysed in much greater detail later in this judgment when dealing with the issues of fact and law. At this stage of reciting briefly the material facts, I need only state the following introductory matters. First, the expression `Mrs KR Thahir` in all the 19 ACU deposits refers to the first defendant, Kartika Ratna Thahir (hereinafter called `Mrs Kartika Thahir`) who by her defence alleges that she is the lawful widow of General Thahir, having lived with him as man and wife since 1969. Secondly, it is common ground (a) that the moneys in all 19 ACU deposits were, at all material times, in separate designated joint deposit accounts of both General Thahir and Mrs Kartika Thahir; (b) that the relationship between Sumitomo Bank, Singapore branch of the one part and General Thahir and Mrs Kartika Thahir of the other part is governed by the law of Singapore under which their relationship is contractual in nature and they are respectively debtors/creditors with the attendant obligations and rights; and (c) that barring disputes, of the nature and type as we have seen in these proceedings, Mrs Kartika Thahir on the death of General Thahir would have become solely entitled to all the moneys in the 19 ACU deposits. Thirdly, on 30 March 1992 counsel for Sumitomo Bank tendered to me a letter dated 28 March 1992 and a bundle of the bank`s documents relating to the said ACU deposits. These documents indicated that as of 27 March 1992 the total of the said ACU deposits including the interest, which had accrued during the intervening period, was US$81,757,260.74. I was further informed that on 30 June 1981, at the requests of and pursuant to the agreement of all parties concerned, the two ACU deposits in US dollars remained in US dollars and the 17 separate ACU deposits denominated in Deutschmarks were converted into a single US dollar account which continued to earn interest.
Three days after the death of General Thahir, Mr Mustapha Thahir and another brother, both sons of General Thahir by an earlier marriage, called at the Djakarta representative office of Sumitomo Bank. They claimed that all the ACU deposits in question belonged to the estate of the deceased. Mr Mustapha Thahir at the same time `directed` the chief representative of the representative office to freeze the ACU deposits `until such time as the respective interests in the estate had been determined`. The general manager of Sumitomo Bank, Singapore branch was informed of these demands on 26 July 1976 by telex. Not unexpectedly, Mrs Kartika Thahir was not idle either. On 27 July 1976 at about noon and again at 4pm, she personally called on Mr Akira Fujimine, General Manager of Sumitomo Bank, Singapore branch. She demanded payment to her of four sums, namely, DM3,287,591.13, DM2,364,187.60, DM2,659,204.26 and US$608,959.42. She further demanded that the balance of the said ACU deposits be transferred to her sole name. At about 2pm the same day, Mr Ibrahim Thahir, one of the children of General Thahir by an earlier marriage, called on Mr Akira Fujimine. Mr Ibrahim Thahir directed Sumitomo Bank, Singapore branch not to pay out any moneys to Mrs Kartika Thahir from the said ACU deposits until the respective beneficial interests of Mrs Kartika Thahir and the estate of General Thahir were determined. Mr Ibrahim Thahir called on the bank again the following day, on 28 July 1976. He was accompanied by Mr Abubakar Thahir and Mr Faruk Thahir. They are all sons of General Thahir by an earlier marriage. They repeated their earlier demands.
On the same day the solicitors of Sumitomo Bank received a letter dated 28 July 1976 from Messrs Drew & Napier, the solicitors of Mrs Kartika Thahir. The letter pointed out the legal rights of Mrs Kartika Thahir and the clear and undoubted obligation on the part of the bank to pay Mrs Kartika Thahir. The letter in its penultimate paragraph volunteered information as follows: 
 
Insofar as it is relevant our client has informed us that she has now been permitted to operate similar ACU joint deposit accounts by the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation, and your client bank is the only bank which has refused her the rights to operate the accounts.
 
 
 
It would appear that Mrs Kartika Thahir had told her solicitors that she had similar ACU joint deposit accounts in two other banks in Singapore.
(c) The interpleader proceedings
Faced with these competing claims, Sumitomo Bank sought interpleader reliefs and commenced these originating summons on 30 July 1976 under O 17 r 1(1)(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 (`the RSC`). Mrs Kartika Thahir was named as the first defendant and Messrs Abubakar Thahir, Ibrahim Thahir and Faruk Thahir were named collectively as the second defendants. The plaintiff bank sought an order that the first and second defendants appear and state the nature and particulars of their respective claims to the said ACU deposits in dispute and maintain or relinquish the same and abide by such order as may be made in these proceedings. By an order of court dated 4 February 1977, Messrs Abubakar Thahir and Ibrahim Thahir were appointed to represent the estate of General Thahir for the purposes of these proceedings. The title of these proceedings were consequently amended.
On 6 May 1977 the then solicitors of Pertamina wrote a letter to Sumitomo Bank. They referred to the interpleader proceedings which the bank had commenced in connection with the ACU deposits held by them. They gave notice to the bank that Pertamina was also claiming to be entitled to the ACU deposits `as they were moneys wrongfully acquired by [General Thahir] by way of bribes while employed by [Pertamina] and contrary to his duty as employee of [Pertamina]`. They further gave notice of intended action. In response, Sumitomo Bank applied to the High Court for Pertamina to be joined as a defendant. By an order of the then Chief Justice made on 24 June 1977, Pertamina was added as a defendant in these proceedings. By an order of the High Court dated 12 March 1980, Pertamina was ordered to be the plaintiffs in these proceedings and that Mrs Kartika Thahir of the one part and the estate of General Thahir of the second part shall be the first and second defendants respectively.
On 20 March 1981 all three parties came to an agreement as to the terms of the issues between them. Those terms were approved by the High Court. They were as follows: 
 
The first issue
 
 
 
Between
 
 
 
Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara (Pertamina) added pursuant to order of court dated 24 June 1977 ... Plaintiffs
 
 
 
And
 
 
 
Kartika Ratna Thahir ... First defendant
 
 
 
Abubakar Thahir and Ibrahim Thahir appointed by order of court dated 4 February 1977 to represent the estate of Haji Achman Thahir and as HA Thahir bin H Muh Thaher and as in H Thaher, deceased ... Second defendants
 
 
 
Interpleader (first) issue
 
 
 
submitted on 21 March 1981 by Mak, Pala, Selvadurai & Tan, solicitors for the abovenamed plaintiffs in the issue pursuant to the orders of court dated 11 and 12 March 1980 Whether as the plaintiffs affirm and the first and second defendants deny, the plaintiffs are entitled to the moneys being the ACU deposits and interest or proceeds in the Sumitomo Bank Ltd (`the said moneys`) in the names of HA Thahir and/or Kartika Ratna Thahir on one or more of the grounds following: 
(a) belong to the plaintiffs absolutely; 
(b) are held subject to a trust in favour of the plaintiffs and not otherwise; 
(c) as being moneys held and received to the plaintiffs` use; 
(d) being the proceeds of crime or otherwise obtained unlawfully and/or in breach of contract by the said HA Thahir should not be disposed of otherwise than to the plaintiffs; 
(e) that the first defendant having assisted the said HA Thahir in his dishonest and fraudulent design and/or having participated therein is in any event liable to the plaintiffs as a constructive trustee thereto.
 
 
 
And in the event that the court finds in favour of the plaintiffs the said moneys (and interest) be paid out to the order of the plaintiffs.
 
 
 
And
 
 
 
In the matter of a second issue ordered to be tried
 
 
 
The second issue
 
 
 
Between
 
 
 
Abubakar Thahir and Ibrahim Thahir appointed by order of court dated 4 February 1977 to represent the estate of Haji Achman Thahir and as HA Thaher bin H Muh Thaher and as in H Thaher, deceased ... Plaintiffs in the second issue
 
 
 
And
 
 
 
Kartika Ratna Thahir ... Defendant in the second issue
 
 
 
Interpleader (second) issue
 
 
 
submitted on 20 March 1981 by Braddell Brothers, solicitors for the abovenamed plaintiffs in the second issue pursuant to the orders of court dated 11 and 12 March 1980 and 2 February 1981 Whether as the plaintiffs affirm and the defendant denies, the plaintiffs are entitled to the moneys being the ACU deposit and interest or proceeds deposited with the Sumitomo Bank Ltd (`the said moneys`) in the names of HA Thahir and/or Kartika Ratna Thahir on one or more of the grounds following: 
(a) that the said moneys belong to the plaintiffs absolutely; 
(b) that the defendant holds the same on trust for the estate of Haji Achman Thahir, deceased; 
(c) by virtue of an agreement dated 13 August 1976 the defendant held upon trust 1U2 of the said moneys and interest for the said estate of Haji Achman Thahir, deceased.
 
 
 
And in the event that the court finds in favour of the plaintiffs (on both issues) the said moneys (and interest) be paid out to the order of the plaintiffs. And in the event that the court finds in favour of the defendant (on both issues) the said moneys (and interest) be paid out to the order of the defendant.
 
 
 
The second interpleader issue as set out above is between the estate of General Thahir on the one hand and Mrs Kartika Thahir on the other. By agreement, it was not dealt with by me during the trial. This agreement was sensible and logical because the matters in dispute under the second interpleader issue will only arise in the event this court decides wholly, or in part, in favour of Mrs Kartika Thahir.
(d) The amended first issue
By an order of the High Court made on 2 December 1988, the first issue was amended as italicized in the following terms: 
 
Whether as the plaintiffs affirm and the first and second defendants deny, the plaintiffs are entitled to the moneys being the ACU deposits and interest or proceeds in the Sumitomo Bank Ltd (`the said moneys`) in the names of HA Thahir and/or Kartika Ratna Thahir 
 and whether such entitlement arises either under the law of the Republic of Singapore as the governing law and/or under the law of Indonesia as the law of the place having most connection with the rights, obligations and duties of the persons hereinafter referred to on one or more of the grounds following
: 
(a) belong to the plaintiffs absolutely; 
(b) are held subject to a trust in favour of the plaintiffs and not otherwise; 
(c) as being moneys held and received to the plaintiffs` use; 
(d) being the proceeds of crime or otherwise obtained unlawfully and/or in breach of contract by the said HA Thahir should not be disposed of otherwise than to the plaintiffs; 
(e) that the first defendant having assisted the said HA Thahir in his dishonest and fraudulent design and/or having participated therein is in any event liable to the plaintiffs as a constructive trustee thereto.
 
 
 
(e) The pleadings
It is now convenient to consider the pleadings. This exercise at this stage, though somewhat extensive, will achieve the principal purpose of seeing how the issues between the parties are defined when the trial finally began in earnest on 20 January 1992. In addition, it will refer in essential terms to both Pertamina`s and Mrs Kartika Thahir`s material assertions of facts and how each assertion had evolved, against which this court can at the conclusion of the trial evaluate, assess and make findings based on the direct oral and documentary evidence which were led and produced on behalf of Pertamina and make reasonable inferences based on and drawn from certain primary facts, so far as Pertamina`s case is concerned. So far as Mrs Kartika Thahir`s case is concerned, expert evidence of two witnesses were called on her behalf to give evidence on the fact of the laws of Indonesia. She did not herself enter the witness box to give any evidence. In the result, her allegations of facts which have to be proved to make good her defences were not proved at all.
The first issue between Pertamina and Mrs Kartika Thahir, which was not in terms pleaded as such, is the question as to which system or systems of law should govern the resolution of the disputes between them. Mr Hunt on behalf of Pertamina puts at the forefront of his submissions that all disputes in this case are to be determined by the law of Singapore and it is a necessary corollary of this submission that the law of Indonesia is not at all applicable. Alternatively,
Mr Hunt submits that the issues in this case are to be determined by a combination of the law of Indonesia, of which a very limited part will come into play, and the law of Singapore. On this submission, it would be necessary to draw the line. He says there are two approaches. First, he says remedy is for the lex fori. If this is the correct approach in law, then every issue between the parties above the remedy line is to be resolved by reference to the law of Indonesia. Secondly, and this is an alternative he says should be applied, this court should only refer to the law of Indonesia to determine the sole question whether the conduct of General Thahir is lawful or unlawful and the inexorable consequence as a matter of conflict of laws is that all other questions, eg whether General Thahir was a fiduciary of Pertamina, whether he breached his fiduciary duties and questions on the law of property, are to be determined by reference to the law of Singapore.
Mr Eder, on the other hand, emphatically disagrees and contends that as a matter of conflict of laws, Pertamina`s claims must fail unless they can establish a proprietary claim against all the 19 ACU deposits, including the accumulated interest, under 
 both 
 the law of Indonesia and the law of Singapore. This prefatory paragraph on the conflict of laws issues which arise in this case will be followed later in this judgment by, it is hoped, a more extensive and intensive analysis of the relevant jurisprudence. According to the pleadings, the establishment and business of Pertamina are admitted by both Mrs Kartika Thahir and the estate of General Thahir. In a case of this nature, the factual questions which relate to the position, authority and powers of General Thahir within Pertamina, and the critical role which he played with regard to the Krakatau steel project have to be carefully investigated. By paras 2 and 3 of the re-reamended statement of claim (`the statement of claim`), Pertamina assert that at all material times from at least 1967 until his death on 23 July 1976 General Thahir was employed as a senior official and executive officer of Pertamina and of their predecessors in title. Pertamina say that from time to time, General Thahir held the positions of (a) general assistant to the then president director, General Ibnu Sutowo; (b) acting director of finance; (c) acting treasurer; and (d) a director of Petra Jasa, which office does not feature in this case and will not be mentioned again. Pertamina further assert by para 3 of the statement of claim that from at least June 1972 until his death, General Thahir was authorized to contract on behalf of the plaintiffs `and/or (by virtue of his position with [Pertamina] on behalf of PT Krakatau Steel [ie PTKS] and/or PT Krakatau Ferrosteel` and to deal with all ancillary matters including the negotiation and implementation of financial arrangements in connection with such contracts. The phrase within the quotation marks were added by amendments which this court allowed at the commencement of the trial. Pertamina further assert that General Thahir was also charged with the duty of supervising the due execution and performance of all the contracts referred to and that it was within his power and authority to arrange for creditors of Pertamina, PTKS and PT Krakatau Ferrosteel, which creditors included Klockner and Siemens, to be paid. By an amendment allowed by this court at the commencement of this trial, Pertamina also make the important assertion that General Thahir was, by virtue of his relationship with General Sutowo and as the latter`s general assistant, in a position of influence with the then president director, General Sutowo, particularly in relation to matters involving construction works and the supply of goods and materials.
Mrs Kartika Thahir`s responses are as follows. By para 3 of the further re-reamended defence (`the defence`) she says that General Thahir `was employed as his personal general assistant` by Pertamina`s then president director, General Sutowo. Apart from this assertion, which obviously suggests that General Thahir`s role was minimal and personal to General Sutowo, she denies the thrust of para 2 of the statement of claim. By para 4 of her defence she denies para 3 of the statement of claim but she says that, save at the request of General Sutowo, General Thahir occasionally oversaw the execution of projects in order to report thereon to General Sutowo. She specifically denies the allegations that General Thahir had any authority to contract on behalf of Pertamina or by virtue of his position with Pertamina to contract on behalf of PTKS or any authority to arrange for Klockner and Siemens to be paid. The estate of General Thahir essentially adopts the assertions of this part of Mrs Kartika Thahir`s defence.
Having made assertions on General Thahir`s employment with Pertamina, his authority and powers, and in particular his role in the Krakatau steel project, Pertamina then deal with the legal consequences of the capacities which General Thahir held under the law of Indonesia and the law of Singapore. Pertamina claim that General Thahir as their director, agent and/or servant owed them `duties and/or` fiduciary duties which are seven-fold. They are, omitting those parts which later turned out to be irrelevant, as follows: (i) to serve Pertamina loyally, diligently and faithfully; (ii) not to accept bribes from those with whom he dealt in the course of his duties on Pertamina`s behalf; (iii) not to use his fiduciary position of trust to acquire any unauthorized benefits for himself; (iv) not to allow his duty to Pertamina to conflict with his personal interests; (v) not to make any personal profit from the use and/or abuse of confidential information which was imparted to him or which he acquired in the course of his duties to Pertamina, nor to cause or permit any such profit to be made for the benefit of anyone other than Pertamina; (vi) to preserve Pertamina`s property and/or assets and not to use or permit the same to be used for any purpose whatsoever otherwise than for Pertamina; and (vii) to pay to Pertamina immediately upon receipt by him all bribes or secret payments or commissions obtained by him (in breach of his duty set out in item (ii) above) from those with whom he dealt in the course of his duties on Pertamina`s behalf. At the end of para 4 of the statement of claim, Pertamina contend that according to both Indonesian and Singapore law, the phrase `[Pertamina`s] property` includes their private and/or confidential information which included information relating to their financial position and prospects. The allegation in this connection is that at the material period Pertamina was in serious financial predicament, and with that knowledge, General Thahir took steps and ensured that Klockner and Siemens were paid in preference to other creditors of Pertamina and/or PTKS. To give a fuller picture as to how the pleadings had evolved, it should be noted that the phrase `duties and/or` mentioned earlier also in this paragraph was added to para 4 of the statement of claim by an amendment allowed by this court at the commencement of the trial. More importantly, it should be noted that the duty itemized as (vii), which was also an amendment allowed at the commencement of the trial, is a duty which was added by Pertamina to foreshadow and underpin Pertamina`s contention that even if
Mr Eder is right in law that Pertamina has to establish a proprietary claim to all 19 ACU deposits under the law of Indonesia, such a claim is a proprietary claim as Pertamina`s experts on the law of Indonesia would opine in evidence at the trial.
Mrs Kartika Thahir denies para 4 of the statement of claim and specifically denies that General Thahir was Pertamina`s director and/or agent or that he held a fiduciary position or had fiduciary duties as alleged. She also denies that private and/or confidential information is capable of constituting Pertamina`s property. By voluntary further and better particulars filed on 25 September 1991, Mr Eder on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir makes a number of assertions under three categories. First and generally, Mrs Kartika Thahir says that General Thahir`s contract of employment with Pertamina was governed by Indonesian law and General Thahir`s duties principally arose out of the employment contract and certain statutory provisions. She further asserts that custom and decisions of Indonesian courts and administrative (labour) tribunals are potential sources of the law relating to an employee`s duties. Secondly, as to the employment contract, she accepts that the employment contract is the primary source of any employee`s duties including any company rules generally applicable to employees and incorporated into the contract by reference. There was, she says in this case, no such written contract. Thirdly, she refers to Indonesian statutory provisions. Under this head, she makes five assertions, viz (i) the Indonesian Civil Code contains general provisions affecting all agreements, eg arts 1338 and 1339. It also creates, eg art 1603a-d, certain statutory duties owed by an employee to an employer; (ii) generally, an employer will have a claim for damages against an employee for breach of contract or the statutory duties under art 1365. Breach of such provisions may entitle the employer to claim damages against the employee for loss actually suffered and Mr Eder underscores the principle of Indonesian law that there is no presumption of loss under Indonesian law; (iii) there is no concept of `fiduciary duties` in the employer-employee relationship and that there is no generally applicable concept of `fiduciary` or `trust` in Indonesian law; (iv) Indonesia has no Civil Code sections and no established case law permitting recovery under a theory of unjust enrichment beyond that which is provided in arts 1360-1362 of the Civil Code; and (v) under Indonesian law, private and confidential information cannot be Pertamina`s property. These wide-ranging questions of Indonesian law will have to await elucidation when I come to consider the expert evidence led by both sides. The estate of General Thahir in its defence substantially adopted the denials and assertions of Mrs Kartika Thahir.
Mr Hunt on behalf of Pertamina successfully applied for the addition of para 4A to the statement of claim in late 1991 where he gave notice of this additional para 4A, and of three other additional paragraphs, which were also added as `A` paragraphs which I will shortly come to later in this judgment, when Pertamina`s application to amend was filed. As they were necessary to define all issues between the parties, all of which should be dealt with at the trial, the amendments were allowed. All four additional paragraphs, namely, paras 4A, 11A, 14A and 16A, were allowed as amendments by this court on 11 February 1992.
By para 4A of the statement of claim, Pertamina further allege that General Thahir was subject to, inter alia, (i) Indonesia Law No 3 of 1971 on the Control of Criminal Acts of Corruption and references are made to the specific articles of that statute as set out in para 5(4) of Pertamina`s reamended reply, which were set out and filed in court as early as 9 April 1981; (ii) Minister of Mines Regulation No 08/P/M/Pertamb/1968, in particular art 39(3) thereof; (iii) Minister of Mines Regulation No 02/P/PM/Pertamb/1971, in particular arts 8 and 9 thereof; and (iv) Presidential Decree No 10 of 1974, in particular arts 7 and 8 prohibiting the receipt of presents or gifts (save in certain exceptional circumstances which are irrelevant for the purposes of this case). Accordingly, Pertamina assert that General Thahir was obliged by the law of Indonesia to refrain from any act prejudicial to Pertamina and, in particular, from committing any act or omission by which he enriched himself at the expense of Pertamina or to the detriment of Pertamina or by virtue of his office with Pertamina. The paragraph goes on to assert that General Thahir was obliged in every respect to act in good faith, to refrain from corruption of any sort and from disloyalty to Pertamina by breach of confidence or otherwise and to refrain from receiving moneys from those with whom he dealt in the course of his duties on Pertamina`s behalf.
Mrs Kartika Thahir`s response is to make no admission of the enactments, regulations or decree and to deny the rest of para 4A of the statement of claim. In specific reference to those contracts entered into by PTKS and/or PT Krakatau Ferrosteel (which she refers to as the `non-Pertamina contracts`), she specifically denies that General Thahir owed any of the duties set out in paras 4 and 4A of the statement of claim.
Paragraph 5 of the statement of claim turns to the position of Mrs Kartika Thahir. Pertamina base their allegations on what Mrs Kartika Thahir had herself alleged. It is averred that Mrs Kartika Thahir alleges that she is the lawful widow of General Thahir and between 1969 and his death had lived with him as his wife and, more materially for the purposes of Pertamina, she had a close and intimate knowledge of his personal dealings and financial affairs, as would be described later in the statement of claim. Mrs Kartika Thahir by para 6 of her defence admits and avers Pertamina`s assertions in this part of the statement of claim. Pertamina obviously place importance on her admission and affirmation by which she admits and affirms that she had a close and intimate knowledge of General Thahir`s personal dealings and financial affairs. As will be seen later, Pertamina go further to make the far more serious and specific allegation that she had knowledge of and/or was privy to General Thahir`s acts of corruption and receipt of the bribes. It should be noted that Pertamina are not concerned with the question whether she is the lawful wife of General Thahir, which is a question that will be relevant at the trial, if any, of the second issue between her and the estate in these proceedings.
The next paragraph of the statement of claim is not controversial. It refers to the appointment by the High Court of the two sons of General Thahir by
Mrs Rukiah Thahir to represent the estate in its claims to the ACU deposits.
By para 7 of the statement of claim Pertamina deals with the position of General Thahir in relation to the Krakatau steel project. They say he was the main policy-maker together with the then president director of Pertamina or alternatively was in a position to influence and/or did influence the policy decisions of the then president director in relation to that particular project, in connection with which the alleged bribes were given by the two German contractors. They say, in particular, that General Thahir was responsible for the conduct of the negotiations, conclusion and implementation of the contracts of the project and was also responsible for the progress and other payments to, inter alia, Klockner and Siemens. So far as the contracts were concerned, Pertamina gave further and better particulars. They say that the contracts were as follows: (1) the hot steel mill contract of June 1974 with Ferrostaal AG, and in fairness to that contractor, it was made clear that Pertamina do not say that it is also their case that they had given any bribe; (2) the steel slab plant of May 1974 with Ferrostaal AG; (3) the purchase contract dated 29 March 1973 between Pertamina and Siemens, the contract value of which was DM36,941,000; (4) the extension of generation and power distribution plant of 4 May 1974 with Siemens, the contract value of which was DM573,703,700; (5) the grinding and palletizing plant with Ferrostaal AG of June 1974; and (6) the contract with Klockner dated 23 January 1974, the contract value of which was DM553,500,000. Pertamina also assert by their further and better particulars that General Thahir used to give oral instructions to one Nur Usman to make the payments to the contractors, including Klockner and Siemens.
Mrs Kartika Thahir denies the allegation and says that General Thahir`s role was to assist General Sutowo who, she says, was second only to the President of the Republic of Indonesia and he was `Pertamina`. On Pertamina`s requests,
Mrs Kartika Thahir alleges that General Sutowo was the second most powerful and influential man in Indonesia and had such a control over the affairs of Pertamina that his actions and knowledge were the actions and knowledge of Pertamina and that, in the premises, she invites the court to pierce the corporate veil.
Paragraph 8 of the statement of claim usefully and compendiously sets out the material particulars of the 19 ACU deposits, which are the subject matter of the claims in this case. It refers to the fact that the ACU deposits were made on the dates indicated. A schedule to this paragraph sets out the sums and the order each ACU deposit was made in Deutschmarks and United States dollars. The schedule referred to in para 8 is annexed hereto and marked `Annexure A`.
I should interpose by referring to an item appearing near the middle portion of the schedule. It refers to the sum of DM7.5m which was withdrawn by General Thahir. As had subsequently transpired, General Thahir had paid this sum to General Sutowo who, after investigations by the authorities in Indonesia, eventually repaid this sum to Pertamina. Mrs Kartika Thahir relies on the fact and size of this transaction to substantiate her allegation that General Sutowo knew of the commissions General Thahir was receiving and for her contention that General Sutowo`s knowledge and consent were those of Pertamina. Pertamina`s response is two-fold: first, General Sutowo was a co-delinquent with General Thahir, by reason of which their wrongful acts will invalidate or nullify any consent which might have been given by General Sutowo to accept the bribes and cannot possibly bind Pertamina; and, secondly, this transaction underlines the influence and intimate relationship between General Sutowo and General Thahir who Klockner and Siemens perceived as important and effective enough as a conduit to get through to General Sutowo as to pay him what Mr Hunt observes was a king`s ransom. In connection with this matter, it is fair to observe that Mr Eder quite properly draws the court`s attention to the fact that Pertamina had the documents since 1982 and had consistently denied that General Sutowo was involved for some eight years before the transaction was disclosed in these proceedings.
Pertamina indicate that they will rely on the admissions contained in
Mrs Kartika Thahir`s solicitors` letter to Sumitomo Bank dated 28 July 1976.
Mrs Kartika Thahir in reply seeks to point out that the reference to an account with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was an error of her then solicitors. She also claims that since the ACU deposits were held in joint names, she became the owner of or solely entitled to the ACU deposits upon the death of General Thahir by operation of law.
We now come to the pivotal issue of fact whether the ACU deposits were the proceeds of General Thahir`s misappropriation of Pertamina`s money and/or property and/or were the proceeds of bribes and/or secret commissions paid to him by Klockner and Siemens. Pertamina`s allegations on these central issues are set out in para 9 of the statement of claim and, in view of their importance and a number of facts and matters upon which Pertamina rely as constituting the pith and substance of their case against Mrs Kartika Thahir, it is reproduced below: 
 
The sums represented by the aforesaid ACU deposits originated in whole or in part from the proceeds of the misappropriation by Thahir of the plaintiffs` money and/or property and/or were in whole or in part the proceeds of bribes and/or secret commissions paid to or received by Thahir in his aforesaid capacities and in breach of the obligations set out in para 4 hereof.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs will rely upon (inter alia) the following facts and matters: 
 
 
(i) As appears from para 7 hereof, at all material times Thahir had the carriage on behalf of the plaintiffs of all matters related to the negotiation, execution and implementation of major contracts with (inter alios) Siemens and Klockner for works in Indonesia and in particular the Krakatau steel project. 
 
(ii) Thahir, in the capacities set forth in para 2, also played a major role in the negotiations of the financial arrangements (including loans) made in connection with the said contracts. 
 
(iii) The monthly salary paid to Thahir by the plaintiffs for the period May 1972 to the date of his death ranged from 157,500 Rupiahs (the equivalent of S$925.88 or US$328.33 at the then prevailing exchange rate) to 249,600 Rupiahs (S$1,468.24 or US$593.95 at the then prevailing exchange rate). At no time did Thahir`s annual salary or legitimate income as a full time officer, servant or agent of the plaintiffs exceed the equivalent Rupiahs 3,782,500 the equivalent of S$22,250, US$9,000 per annum. Furthermore Thahir was not possessed of any substantial assets, property or legitimate income from any other source. 
 
(iv) Thahir`s deposits since 1973 in ACU deposits at Sumitomo alone exceeded DM50m and US$1m. (The total equivalent in US$ of the aforesaid sums was at all material times not less than US$20m, that is to say more than 33,672 times his maximum monthly salary and 2,222 times his maximum annual salary.) The plaintiffs cannot particularize before discovery and/or the administration of interrogatories herein the deposits of funds elsewhere. 
 
(v) It is inconceivable that the said sums could have accrued legitimately to Thahir either from the salary paid by the plaintiffs to him or otherwise. Further at no time in the course of this litigation since 1977 have the defendants or any of them alleged or suggested any or any legitimate or lawful or proper source of the said funds or any or any legitimate or lawful or proper means by which the same were acquired. 
 
(vi) The currency of the account and payment in relation to the contracts specified in (i) hereof were in Deutschmarks and/or United States dollars. Deutschmarks and/or United States dollars were likewise the currency in which the ACU deposits aforesaid originated and were subsequently held. The plaintiffs will contend res ipsa loquitur and will if necessary further rely upon s 116 of the Singapore Evidence Act (Cap 97).
  
 
 
Further, the plaintiffs will if necessary rely on the following facts and matters: 
(vii) The said contracts provided for instalment and/or progress payments to be made to the contractors by the plaintiffs ... 
(viii) As shown in the schedule annexed hereto and marked [`Annexure B` which is headed `Summary of pairings identified using computerized comparison`], on the various dates set out in the column headed `Opening date` there were credited to Thahir the sums set out in the column headed `Gross deposit`. Each such sum was the stated percentage of the respective payment to a German contractor set out under the heading `Payments to German contractors`.
 
 
 
The statistical probability of the said payments and the said deposits not being temporarily and financially related is in excess of 1,000,000 : 1 against. [In the course of his opening, Mr Hunt informs me that the expert has revised the figure to 500,000 : 1, for which I shall go into the expert evidence later in this judgment.] 
(ix) From about the end of 1973 Thahir was possessed of confidential information that the plaintiffs` financial resources were strained and that its economic viability was in danger. Thahir well knew that there was a risk that the said contractors might not be paid the moneys due or to become due to them. Accordingly Thahir arranged for the said contractors to receive substantial sums from the plaintiffs when he and the said contractors well knew that such payments were in the nature of fraudulent preferences. Further or in the alternative Thahir arranged for payments to the said contractors (amongst others) to be given preference over payments to other creditors of the plaintiffs. For his services in this respect Thahir retained part of the funds over which he had control or alternatively he was rewarded by Siemens and/or Klockner by a payment of commission the proceeds whereof are represented in part by the ACU deposits, the subject of this claim. The best particulars the plaintiffs can give in this connection at this stage are those set out in (viii) above. 
(x) To facilitate the passing of money to Thahir both Siemens and Klockner made written requests to the treasurer for foreign currency of Pertamina, one Nur Usman, to change the conditions of payment under their said contracts to provide that letters of credit opened in favour of PT Siemens Indonesia with Dresdner Bank Singapore, 6 Shenton Way and in favour of Klockner Industrie Anlagen GMBH with the Dresdner Bank, Duisburg should provide beside the usual conditions the following clauses: `transferable more than once and outside Singapore` (Siemens letter dated 29 June 1974). `Irrevocable, transferable and divisible` (Klockner letter dated 22 February 1974). The plaintiffs will rely upon the said letters for their full terms and effect. 
(xi) The plaintiffs will contend that but for his death, Thahir would have attempted to obtain from, inter alios, Siemens a further DM15m. In April 1979 (and notwithstanding the impropriety thereof) Kartika was responsible for instituting attempts to obtain the said sums from Siemens. The best particulars the plaintiffs can give before discovery appear in para 15(x)-(xiii) hereunder.
 
 
 
Pertamina obviously have to establish on a balance of probabilities that all or substantially all of the 19 ACU deposits had emanated from, or are directly linked, to their payments to both Klockner and Siemens under their contracts with the two German contractors in relation to the Krakatau steel project or some other projects of Pertamina. By the evidence they will lead which is summarized in Annexure B, they say they will have established 
 11 matches 
 out of the 19 ACU deposits. As will be seen from a study of Annexure B, for the explanation of which I will refer to the expert evidence later, the 
 11 matches 
 amount to DM45,291,623.67. If the alleged 
 11 matches 
 are found to be correct in truth and in fact, they amount to 83.9% of the total ACU deposits of DM53,972,374.12.
Mr Eder in closing observes that only 
 11 
 of the 19 ACU deposits had been matched and this comment elicited from Mr Hunt the inevitable riposte that it is the aggregate quantum and not the number of matches that is more material and significant.
It is also convenient to observe at this stage that 
 Match 11 
 , as a result of discovery of documents in the course of the trial, was shown to be Siemens` 10% payment to General Thahir for Pertamina`s Diesel Electric Power Station and an airport in Batam Island, Indonesia. On behalf of Pertamina Mr Hunt emphasizes that this subsequent discovery confirms the accuracy of the investigative work of Pertamina`s experts and also points to the fact that General Thahir had his `finger in many pies`. He also hastens to point out that the 
 11 matches 
 cumulatively give rise to a strong inference that the rest of the DM ACU deposits were also bribes and that this inference standing by itself is more than reasonable, without this court having to consider all other evidence, including in particular the alleged admissions of Mrs Kartika Thahir to General Benny Moerdani in Geneva, which point in the same direction.
In view of the breadth and depth of the allegations as set out in para 9 of the statement of claim and in the particulars in several sub-paragraphs, Mrs Kartika Thahir sought a number of further and better particulars. These particulars, which were given by Pertamina, should now be summarized. Mr Hunt`s comments will also be referred to from time to time. In relation to the particulars required to support Pertamina`s allegations of General Thahir`s misappropriation or receipt of bribes, Pertamina refer to another major plank of their case against Mrs Kartika Thahir. They say that Mrs Kartika Thahir in September 1977 in Geneva, Switzerland had admitted to General Benny Moerdani, now Minister of Defence and Security of Indonesia, that the ACU deposits consisted of payments made to General Thahir by Siemens and Klockner by way of bribes and/or commissions. In addition, Pertamina say that the facts speak for themselves and that they will rely on s 116 of the Singapore Evidence Act (Cap 5, 1970 Ed). On being asked for further and better particulars of the purposes for which the alleged bribes were paid to General Thahir, Pertamina say that they will invite the court to infer that the bribes were paid for the following purposes, viz (i) to ensure that Siemens and Klockner were given preferential treatment where payments were concerned, in view of the reducing resources of Pertamina in 1974 and 1975; and (ii) to allow Siemens and Klockner better contractual terms than they would have obtained if they had had to tender in competition for their work. Pertamina had originally alleged grossly excessive prices but this allegation of over-pricing was not allowed by this court to be revived as it had been abandoned at an earlier stage of these proceedings. Mr Hunt submits, however, that as a matter of Singapore law, it is irrelevant what General Thahir did for his German paymasters.
In relation to the alleged secret nature of the commissions paid to General Thahir, Mrs Kartika Thahir requires Pertamina to specify `who ought to have known but did not in fact know of them`. Although Mr Hunt describes this request as curious, Pertamina`s response is to say that the commissions were secret in the sense that they were received by General Thahir as an employee of Pertamina in breach of the duties of fidelity to them. They go on to say that the board of directors ought to have been made fully aware of them but were not and that, in any case, it would have been ultra vires the board to have approved such payments for General Thahir`s benefit.
I should now set out Mrs Kartika Thahir`s defence by reciting para 10 of her defence, which is in the following terms: 
 
The first sentence of para 9 of the reamended statement of claim is denied. It is denied that Thahir misappropriated the plaintiffs` money or property or that he was bribed, or that he received secret commissions as there alleged or at all. It was not a term of Thahir`s employment as general assistant to Sutowo that he should serve exclusively in that capacity. Thahir was free to supplement his said very small salary by remuneration earned in his private capacity. The fact that Thahir received income apart from his salary was not secret, but was known both to the plaintiffs, by inter alios their said president director, and to the plaintiffs` principal, the state government, who consented thereto.
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
The first defendant will say that knowledge and consent must be inferred from the following facts and matters: 
(i) The amount of Thahir`s annual salary paid by the plaintiffs was known to (inter alios) Sutowo and to the President of Indonesia. 
(ii) Certain payments received by Thahir were remitted by him to Sutowo. Thus, on or about 10 June 1974, Thahir remitted to Sutowo DM7.5m. Sutowo kept a deposit account or accounts with the said Singapore branch of Sumitomo. On or about 
24 April 1975, Sutowo`s credit balance on one such account was DM8,017,152.52.
 
 
 
 
(iii) Since early 1974 Thahir kept a deposit account of about 200m Rupiah with the PT Pacific Bank of Jakarta of which Sutowo was and is the major shareholder. Thahir specifically kept a large deposit with the said bank in order to assist Sutowo in his banking interests.
  
 
 
 
(iv) Towards the end of 1974, Sutowo, Haji Yusuf and Thahir agreed to build a cement plant in Sumatra costing about DM50-60m. Sutowo and Thahir agreed to put up the finance out of their own resources in equal parts, the said Wibisowo agreed to act as managing director of the proposed cement plant company. Thahir agreed to provide his share of the finance out of the said ACU deposits. 
 
(v) Towards the end of 1975, the head of the plaintiffs` exploration division, one Soediono, came to Thahir`s home in Jakarta and proposed to him that he should invest DM30m out of his personal resources in a steel pipe manufactory which Mannesman AG proposed to build in Jakarta. 
 
(vi) It was at all material times usual and lawful for high-ranking officials of (inter alios) the plaintiffs and its subsidiaries to supplement their very small salaries by remittance deriving from (inter alios) the plaintiffs` contractors. Such officials include the said Soediono, the head of Pertamina shipping, one Sukotojo, the head of Pertamina domestic petroleum distribution, one Judo Sumbowo, and the Pertamina manager of the Dumai project, one Patiasina. Further the president director of Krakatau steel project from its revival by the Indonesian government until early 1976, one Marijuni, received commissions from contractors for the said project including Ferrostahl AG, who carried out works for about US$1.2 bn. 
 
(vii) and (viii) were deleted. 
 
(ix) The first defendant will aver that the size of Thahir`s additional income was not unusual for a person of his standing as to the amounts involved.
  
 
 
By a new para 10A in her defence, Mrs Kartika Thahir asserts that Pertamina have no title to maintain the action. She grounds this contention on the basis that the contracts with Klockner and Siemens were entered into by or on behalf of PTKS and/or PT Krakatau Ferrosteel and the fact that payments were made to the two German contractors under those contracts to which Pertamina are strangers.
By para 11 of her defence, Mrs Kartika Thahir admitted the salary paid to General Thahir by Pertamina, the ACU deposits, their currencies and dates of payment and the attempts to obtain the further sums. She, however, denies the rest of the allegations in para 9 of the statement of claim. She says in particular that General Sutowo was in charge of the contracts. By voluntary further particulars filed on 25 September 1991 she refers to para 9(ix) of the statement of claim and asserts that the Indonesian Bankruptcy Act contains provisions analogous to the Anglo-Saxon concept of `fraudulent preference` but such provisions have no application outside the context of bankruptcy.
The estate of General Thahir asserts that he had independent means and was possessed of substantial assets and property. He owned a house in Jakarta valued at Rupiahs 80m. He owned a piece of land in Palembang, Indonesia with an area of 9,850sq m. He also owned two houses and two pieces of land in that city which were valued at Rupiahs 7.5m each. By para 10 of its defence the estate of General Thahir says that at all material times General Thahir was entitled to carry on business on his own account. He was in business prior to his appointment in 1965 as general assistant to the then president director of Pertamina. In 1952 General Thahir became a director of a company which dealt in commodities such as rubber, coffee, etc. He also joined a shipping company. Mr Hunt mentions that the rate of exchange between 1972 and 1975 was 170 Rupiahs to the Singapore dollar, `just to give one some sort of feel of what the figures mean`.
By para 10 of the statement of claim Pertamina asserts that General Thahir was entrusted with intangible property, namely, the confidential information of Pertamina in relation to their intentions, abilities and powers regarding the contracts which General Thahir negotiated, concluded and implemented with Klockner and Siemens. They say that they are entitled to rely on General Thahir to deal with such property for their benefit and to procure for them the best possible terms. By agreeing to receive bribes, they say that General Thahir had caused them loss. Mrs Kartika Thahir by para 12 of her defence denies that General Thahir had played the roles which Pertamina allege in relation to the contracts. General Thahir had done no more than what Pertamina was obliged to do under the contracts with Klockner and Siemens.
Mrs Kartika Thahir adds an important set of further and better particulars under para 12 of her defence. By the said voluntary particulars filed on 25 September 1991, she reiterates the proposition that under Indonesian law the receipt of any commission is not per se unlawful. Her particulars go on to assert that the receipt of such commissions may, depending upon the terms of the employment contract, constitute a breach of such contract; but, notwithstanding any such terms, an employer may generally consent to the employee`s practices in performing his job including, inter alia, the employee`s receipt of commissions. Under Law No 8/1971, she says that the knowledge of the president director constitutes knowledge of Pertamina.
At this juncture, it is more appropriate in my view to deal with paras 11 and 12 of the statement of claim together and the defence of both Mrs Kartika and the estate of General Thahir before I come back to the amended para 11A of the statement of claim. By para 11 Pertamina, relying on the particulars set out in para 9 of the statement of claim, repeat their allegation that General Thahir had acted in breach of duty as described in their averments and contend that the ACU deposits (being the proceeds of moneys retained and/or bribes, rewards or commissions paid to or to the order of General Thahir 
 as their agent or mandatory 
 are in fact and in Indonesian law and/or Singapore law the property of Pertamina. By para 12 Pertamina claim that General Thahir was until his death 
 constructive trustee 
 and thereafter Mrs Kartika Thahir and/or the estate of General Thahir, became 
 constructive trustees 
 for Pertamina of the ACU deposits and by reason thereof or otherwise by operation of the law of Indonesia and/or of Singapore Mrs Kartika Thahir and/or the estate of General Thahir were bound to hold the same for Pertamina absolutely and/or to account therefor to Pertamina as money had and received to Pertamina`s use and/or Pertamina are entitled to trace the said moneys into any account or accounts in Mrs Kartika Thahir`s name.
By para 13 of her defence, Mrs Kartika Thahir denies para 11 of the statement of claim. She further denies that the ACU deposits are the property of Pertamina or that anyone other than General Thahir was the intended payee thereof. She also denies that General Thahir was trustee of his powers as Pertamina allege. Without prejudice to the generality of her denials and assertions, she contends that the concept of `mandatory` is unknown to Singapore law and that as a matter of Indonesian law, a `mandate` is a contract in which one person, the principal/mandator gives to another, the mandatory, a power to execute a juristic act in his name. She specifically denies that General Thahir was such a mandatory as alleged or at all. By her voluntary further and better particulars of September 1991, she advances three more propositions, viz (a) as a matter of Indonesian law, General Thahir did not act in breach of any fiduciary duty and, in so far as any ACU deposits were the proceeds of commissions, such moneys were not the `property` of Pertamina; (b) General Thahir was not a `trustee of his powers`, such concept being unknown in Indonesian law; and (c) General Thahir did not become a `trustee` of any of the said moneys; neither Mrs Kartika Thahir nor the estate of General Thahir became constructive trustee nor did they become bound to hold the said moneys for Pertamina or to account therefor to Pertamina as money had and received on the basis that such concepts are unknown in Indonesian law.
I now return to Pertamina`s amended para 14A which pleads squarely their position under Indonesian law. By taking bribes and/or secret commissions as alleged General Thahir was in breach of his contractual duties as their employee, was in violation of the statutory provisions pleaded in para 4A of the statement of claim and had committed a tort against Pertamina. Pertamina proceed to contend that they would have been entitled to recover from General Thahir and are entitled to recover from his estate the said ACU deposits by way of performance of General Thahir`s contractual duties and/or as the appropriate remedy for such breach of his contractual duties and/or tort and/or pursuant to the doctrine of unjust enrichment.
The defence of Mrs Kartika Thahir should be addressed in full. They are set out extensively in paras 13A-13L, which were amended on 23 December 1991 by order of this court. The estate of General Thahir adopts these defences. Paragraph 13A is a general denial. The rest of these paragraphs are in the following terms: 
 
 
(13) A Each and every allegation in para 11A of the reamended statement of claim is denied. 
 
(13) B Without prejudice 
 
(a) to the generality of the foregoing and 
 
(b) to the first defendant`s right to plead further to the allegations contained in that paragraph if and when the plaintiffs serve an answer to the first defendant`s request for further and better particulars the first defendant will contend as follows. 
 
(13) C The amendments to the statement of claim relate back to the original date of service of the statement of claim, viz 8 April 1981. In the premises, all causes of action which arose more than six years prior to that date, viz 8 April 1975 are time-barred and, for that reason, unmaintainable. On the plaintiffs` own case, all the plaintiffs` claim are based upon causes of action which arose prior to 8 April 1975 and, in the premises, are time-barred and unmaintainable. 
 
(13) D As to the allegations in para 11A(i)(a) and (c), the first defendant repeats paras 5, 10 and 12 above and the further particulars of Indonesian law already served on 
 
25 September 1991. 
 
(13) E As to the allegations contained in para 11A(i)(b), ie alleged violation of the alleged statutory provisions referred to in para 4A of the reamended statement of claim, 
 
(i) The High Court of Singapore has no jurisdiction to entertain an action or claim for the enforcement either directly or indirectly of a foreign penal or other public law and the remainder of this pleading is served without prejudice thereto. 
 
(ii) As a matter of Indonesian law, the plaintiffs in this action have no civil claim, whether propriety [sic] or otherwise, for any such alleged violation. 
 
(iii) In the alternative to (ii) above: 
 
(1) No prosecution or other action was commenced prior to General Thahir`s death and, as a matter of Indonesian law: 
 
(a) no such prosecution or action could thereafter be made; and 
 
(b) in the absence of any successful prosecution or action, no civil action based upon such alleged violations was or is now maintainable. 
 
(2) Further or alternatively, even if (which is denied) such civil claim does exist in Indonesian law, such claim is not maintainable in this court because, as a matter of Singapore conflict of laws, it does not satisfy the double-actionability rule. 
 
(13) F With regard to Law No 3/1971: 
 
As to s 1(a) of that law, it is specifically denied that General Thahir committed any act
  
 
 
 
(1) which was in contravention of the law as referred to in sub-para 1(a) of that law; 
 
(2) which directly or indirectly caused a loss to the state`s funds and economy; 
 
(3) which he knew or had reason to believe would cause a loss to the state`s funds and economy. 
 
(13) G With regard to Regulation No 2/1968: 
 
This purported regulation was revoked by Regulation No 2/1971 and is inapplicable. 
 
(13) H With regard to Regulation No 2/1971: 
 
(a) This Regulation was purportedly made on 17 May 1971 and by its terms applied to 
 certain 
 personnel only of PN Pertamina 
 not 
 the plaintiffs in this action and is inapplicable. 
 
(b) 
 Subsequently 
, the plaintiffs in this action were established by Law No 8/1971 which was enacted on 15 September 1971. Regulation No 2/1971 did not apply to the plaintiffs. 
 
(c) Article 33(1) of Law No 8/1971 provided that matters not yet sufficiently regulated in that law shall be 
 subsequently 
 provided by government regulation. Regulation No 2/1971 was 
 prior 
 to 
 not 
 subsequent to Law No 8/1971 and is, for that reason, inapplicable. 
 
(d) Further or alternatively, Regulation No 2/71 was superseded by Regulation No 2/72, alternatively Regulation No 3/72. 
 
(e) In any event, and without prejudice to any of the foregoing: 
 
(1) Regulation No 2/71 did not, by virtue of its own terms, have any application to any employee who was governed by a separate salary regulation. The plaintiffs` case is that General Thahir was governed by a separate salary regulation and, on that basis, it is specifically denied that he was an `employee` within the definition of that regulation. 
 
(2) By its express terms, the regulation is only applicable to 
 certain 
 employees as designated therein. The plaintiffs are put to strict proof that General Thahir was such an employee. 
 
(13) I With regard to Presidential Decree No 10: 
 
(1) By its terms, that decree only applies to certain officials as stipulated in Government Regulation No 6 Year 1974. General Thahir was not an `official` within the meaning of that regulation. 
 
(2) In any event, that decree was purportedly made on 5 March 1974. It was not retrospective and, in the premises, has no application to any moneys which may have been received by General Thahir, prior to that date. 
 
(3) By art 13 of that decree, the sanctions which were applicable to uphold its implementation were limited to those set out therein. They do not include any claim by the plaintiffs. 
 
(13) J As to the allegation in 11A(ii) 
 
(1) If (which is denied) the plaintiffs have any claim against the estate by reason of the matters stated therein, such claim is irrelevant as between the plaintiffs and the first defendant in the context of these interpleader proceedings within RSC O 17 and the amended issue herein. 
 
(2) Further or alternatively, even if (which is denied) the plaintiffs would have had any of the entitlements referred to in this sub-paragraph under Indonesian law, such would-be entitlements in any event provide no basis for any claim to the moneys in the ACU deposit accounts in the context of these interpleader proceedings within RSC O 17 and the amended issue herein. 
 
(3) In any event, the first defendant repeats the further particulars of Indonesian law served on 25 September 1991 and will further contend that as a matter of Indonesian law: 
 
(a) None of the alleged modes of entitlement give rise to any proprietary claim against the moneys in the ACU deposit accounts. 
 
(b) The plaintiffs had no entitlement to seek recovery `by way of performance` of any alleged contractual duties. 
 
(c) Such remedy as the plaintiffs may have had was a remedy in damages only subject to proof of: 
 
(i) actual loss suffered by the plaintiffs themselves; 
 
(ii) such loss was caused by a wrongful act; 
 
(iii) such loss was foreseeable. 
 
The plaintiffs are put to strict proof of each of the foregoing. 
 
(d) Alternatively, if ,which is denied, there was any contractual obligation of a kind referred to in para 3(vii) of the reamended statement of claim and if, which is further denied, the plaintiffs had any entitlement to performance of such obligation, such entitlement was limited to the moneys actually received and no more other than simple interest of 6%pa calculated on the actual amount of proven damages from the date of the commencement of any action by the plaintiffs. In particular, it is specifically denied that the plaintiffs had any entitlement to any interest actually earned thereon. 
 
(e) There is no doctrine of unjust enrichment at all or under which the plaintiffs could make a proprietary claim for any moneys received by Thahir or against the ACU deposits or under which the plaintiffs make a proprietary claim for specific performance or restitution in their favour. 
 
(13) K Further or alternatively, with regard to the non-Pertamina contracts, the first defendant will say that any payments that Pertamina may have made were, on the plaintiffs` own case, made as agent for and on behalf of the particular contracting Indonesian party. The first defendant will further contend:
  
 
 
 
(1) That, as a matter of Indonesian law, there is no presumption of loss and, in the absence of proof of loss actually suffered by reason of any breach of duties owed by General Thahir to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs cannot maintain any action. 
 
(2) That it is denied that the plaintiffs have suffered any actual loss by reason of any breach of duties owed by General Thahir to the plaintiffs. 
 
(3) That, even if (which is denied) any payments were originally made by the plaintiffs in such capacity, the plaintiffs were subsequently reimbursed in respect of all such payments as they may have made and, for that reason, have suffered no loss. 
 
(4) Further or alternatively, in the premises, the plaintiffs have not borne the expense of any of the alleged payments and, as a matter of Singapore law, the plaintiffs cannot maintain the present claim. 
 
(13) L In any event, the first defendant will contend: 
 
(1) that pursuant to Presidential Decree No 30/1975, the status of the contracts between the plaintiffs and the other contractors was changed into contracts between PT Krakatau Steel and the relevant contractors and the plaintiffs were thereafter fully reimbursed in respect of any such payments; and/or 
 
(2) that the plaintiffs entered into separate tripartite agreements with PT Krakatau Steel and, inter alia, Siemens and Klockner whereby it was agreed: 
 
(a) that all payments made by the plaintiffs under the relevant contract were deemed to have been made by PT Krakatau Steel and all work done by Siemens/Klockner under the relevant contract were deemed to have been done under a contract with PT Krakatau Steel; 
 
(c) that with regard to the stipulated contracts with the plaintiffs, such contracts were deemed to have been transferred to PT Krakatau Steel. 
 
(3) In the premises, the plaintiffs have suffered no loss and/or cannot maintain this action.
  
 
 
As to para 13C of the defence of Mrs Kartika Thahir, Pertamina by para 8 of their re-reamended reply say that if, which is not admitted, any of their causes of action arose prior to 8 April 1975, Pertamina will contend that General Thahir and/or Mrs Kartika Thahir deliberately and in fraud of Pertamina concealed from them until at least the date of General Thahir`s death on 23 July 1976 the facts and matters pleaded in the statement of claim. Pertamina rely on the first sentence of para 8, first paragraph and (iv), (vi), (viii) (first sentence), (ix) (fifth and sixth sentences), (xi) of para 9 and (iv) (first two lines), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of para 15 of their statement of claim. Paragraph 15 of the statement of claim will be set out later in this judgment.
Pertamina in para 13 of the statement of claim deal with the capacity of the Sumitomo Bank. They say that the ACU deposits were paid to the bank as agent for Pertamina by or on behalf of General Thahir and he was liable to account therefor to Pertamina. After his death Mrs Kartika Thahir and/or his estate (if either had any lawful interest therein which is denied) became liable to account therefor to Pertamina and they contend that the said ACU deposits continue to be held by them on Pertamina`s behalf and not otherwise. Mrs Kartika Thahir denies the alleged agency of the bank and her liability to account therefor to Pertamina.
By para 14 of the statement of claim Pertamina refer to Mrs Kartika Thahir`s allegation that the said ACU deposits were held from early 1974 in the joint names of General Thahir and herself but Pertamina deny the legality, propriety or enforceability of the purported transfer of the ACU deposits into joint names in Indonesian and/or Singapore law.
Pertamina in their claim proceed to deal with the position and complicity of Mrs Kartika. These are extensively alleged in paras 15 and 16 of the statement of claim and, in view of the crucial averments therein, they are accordingly reproduced below: 
 
 
(15) If and in so far as may be necessary, the plaintiffs will contend that Kartika had knowledge of and/or was privy to the facts and matters set out in para 9 hereof. The plaintiffs will rely upon the following facts and matters: 
 
(i) Kartika alleges that she was married to Thahir on 29 July 1984. 
 
(ii) Kartika had lived with Thahir as his mistress for a period of approximately five years prior to the said purported marriage. 
 
(iii) Kartika well knew of Thahir`s position with and duties to the plaintiffs and his income and wealth as set out in paras 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9 hereof. 
 
(iv) Kartika was well aware of Thahir`s unlawful and improper arrangements with German contractors as aforesaid and was frequently present at meetings and discussions with the representatives of such contractors, namely: 
 
(a) In 1973, Thahir accompanied by Kartika and others attended a meeting in Western Germany with Martin Struchen of Martin Struchen GMBH in order to discuss the possible resolution of Pertamina`s financial crisis. 
 
(b) At Bonn in Western Germany at about the same time Thahir and Kartika attended a meeting with the financial director of Siemens. 
 
(c) In 1974 in Singapore Kartika attended a business meeting between Thahir and one Lohse (a representative of Klockner) who was well known to Kartika. The said meeting concerned the Krakatau steel project and the financial arrangements therefor. 
 
(v) Kartika knew and/or was privy to the fact that Thahir received the sums of money represented by the ACU deposit accounts. In or about August 1972 in Singapore Thahir and Kartika discussed with the chairman of Sumitomo the opening in Singapore of a joint deposit account with its Singapore branch. Both Thahir and Kartika emphasized that such deposits should be kept secret and that they should each have drawing rights. She also attended meetings in early 1974 in Japan between Thahir and one Hotta, the then chairman of Sumitomo. The subject of the said meetings was the opening of the said ACU deposit accounts and the disposition of the moneys represented thereby. 
 
(vi) In or about 1974, Kartika attended meetings in Singapore between Thahir and one Yamaura, the then branch manager of Sumitomo. The subject of the said meetings was the opening of the said ACU deposit accounts and the disposition of the sums of money represented thereby. 
 
(vii) After the said ACU deposit accounts were opened Kartika kept herself fully informed of the state thereof and of the sums of moneys represented thereby. The plaintiffs will rely on admissions in affidavits sworn by Kartika on 
 
2 March 1977 and 31 January and/or 1 February 1980. 
 
(viii) In 1976, Thahir and Kartika planned to use some of the said moneys to purchase or attempt to purchase the Hyatt Hotel, Singapore. 
 
(ix) By reason of her knowledge of the wrongdoing of Thahir to which she was party Kartika improperly attempted to prevent any adverse claims being made in respect of the said ACU deposits by proceeding to Singapore promptly on the death of Thahir in an endeavour to withdraw funds held at, inter alia, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Chase Manhattan NV and Sumitomo Bank Ltd. She immediately withdrew the funds held at Hongkong and Shanghai and Chase Manhattan (further particulars whereof cannot be given until after discovery) but she failed to persuade Sumitomo to pay to her the amounts represented by the ACU deposits, the subject of this claim. 
 
(x) At about the end of 1976 or the beginning of 1977, Kartika requested one Raharjo Sudjie in Jakarta to contact Ibrahim Thahir, another son of the deceased, to ask him to travel to Singapore in order to discuss, inter alia, ways and means of persuading the German contractors to pay moneys allegedly due from them to Thahir. 
 
(xi) Kartika admitted to Sudjie that the reason why Thahir remained with the plaintiffs during 1976 despite the fact that all his colleagues had retired was that Thahir was still expecting payment of the balance of commissions from the German contractors. 
 
(xii) Consequent upon such meeting and with a view to pursuing her illegal claims, Kartika on or about 29 August 1977 obtained a power of attorney from Ibrahim Thahir acting on behalf of himself and the estate to enable her to seek to recover moneys allegedly owed to Thahir by Siemens International Department, Munich, West Germany. 
 
(xiii) By an agreement in writing dated 29 August 1977 and made in Basel, Switzerland, Kartika and Ibrahim Thahir acting as aforesaid agree that - `all claims against Siemens roughly in the amount of DM15m were to be divided between the parties`. 
 
(xiv) The plaintiffs will further rely upon an oral admission made by Kartika to General Moerdani on or about 20 September 1977 in Switzerland to the effect that the money in the Sumitomo Bank came from the contractors in the Krakatau steel project and that Siemens was the source of DM15m and Klockner was the source of DM35m. 
 
(16) In the premises, Kartika was and has at all material times been a party to the wrongdoing of Thahir and has held the said sum jointly with him and/or in her own name for and on account of and/or in trust for the plaintiffs and not otherwise. Further by her attempts to obtain the said moneys for her own use from the date the same were jointly transferred into her name jointly with Thahir she was guilty of seeking to make effective and to perpetuate the frauds upon the plaintiffs to which she was privy. Further or alternatively she knowingly participated in and/or assisted Thahir in this dishonest and fraudulent design in breach of his duties and/or fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs hereinbefore described.
  
 
 
Mrs Kartika Thahir`s assertions in defence are equally crucial in importance and paras 16 and 17 of her defence, which are adopted by the estate of General Thahir, are set out below in seriatim. 
 
 
(16) (i) The first defendant admits and avers that the ACU deposits were held from early 1974 in the joint names of Thahir and herself, that she lived with Thahir for approximately five years prior to her marriage to him, that she married him on 
 
29 July 1974 and that as his close companion and wife she had general, although not detailed, knowledge of his business and financial affairs. 
 
(ii) Save that the first defendant habitually travelled with Thahir and attended (but in a social capacity only) the meeting referred to in para 15(iv)(a) of the reamended statement of claim, sub-para (iv) thereof is denied. It is denied that the first defendant was aware of unlawful arrangements of Thahir with German contractors (which are denied). The first defendant avers that officials and local representatives of the plaintiffs were present at all discussions between Thahir and foreign contractors and bankers. In particular, Dr Sanger was present at meetings in Switzerland, Mr Karinda was present at other European meetings, Mr Hasmoro at meetings in the United States of America and Mr Nur Usman at meetings concerning financial arrangements including proposed loans to the plaintiffs. 
 
(iii) Paragraph 15(v), (vi) and (vii) of the reamended statement of claim is admitted. 
 
(iv) After the death of Thahir, the first defendant unsuccessfully endeavoured to withdraw four of the said ACU deposits which had matured by 26 July 1976. Further, as she was entitled to do, she withdrew funds belonging to her from the Chase Manhattan Bank NV. Save as aforesaid, para 15(ix) of the reamended statement of claim is denied. It is denied that the first defendant effected, or attempted to effect, such withdrawals for the alleged or any improper motives. After the death of her husband she decided to make her home in Europe and to rearrange her affairs accordingly. 
 
(v) Save that it is denied that the first defendant acted illegally or improperly, 
 
para 15(x), (xii) and (xiii) of the reamended statement of claim is admitted. Sub-para (xi) and (xiv) thereof are denied. 
 
(17) Paragraph 16 of the reamended statement of claim is denied. It is denied that the first defendant was a party to the alleged or any wrongdoing of Thahir (which is denied) or that she knowingly participated in or assisted Thahir in the alleged or any dishonest and fraudulent design (which is denied) or that her attempts to obtain the said moneys for her own use were anything other than attempts to enforce her legal rights.
  
 
 
We now come to the new para 16A of the statement of claim which separately sets out Pertamina`s case against both the defendants under Indonesian law. Pertamina contend that they are entitled to the ACU deposits from Mrs Kartika Thahir as the appropriate remedy for her tort as an accomplice of Thahir in his tort against them. As against her, Pertamina rely on the facts and matters set out in para 15 of their statement of claim. In addition or in the alternative Pertamina say that they are also entitled to the ACU deposits pursuant to the doctrine of unjust enrichment. Mrs Kartika Thahir denies these contentions and repeat paras 13A-13L of her defence.
Pertamina then allege by para 17 of the statement of claim conspiracy by General Thahir, Mrs Kartika Thahir and others unknown to defraud Pertamina by arranging for the moneys in the ACU deposits, which should have remained with Pertamina, to be channelled to General Thahir and/or Mrs Kartika Thahir. They therefore claim that the ACU deposits are their moneys. Mrs Kartika Thahir denies the alleged conspiracy to defraud and specifically denies that the said moneys were or should have remained with Pertamina. The estate pleads a general denial.
In para 18 of the statement of claim, Pertamina refer to the attempts of
Mrs Kartika Thahir and Ibrahim Thahir, who acted on behalf of the estate, to obtain payment of DM15m from Siemens. They claim that in doing so they, and others unknown, conspired to defraud Pertamina of what was the property of Pertamina. Mrs Kartika alleges that she was entitled to obtain payment of the remaining sums due to General Thahir but otherwise denies any conspiracy to defraud or that the sums were in any sense the property of Pertamina. Again, the estate pleads a general denial.
Finally and by para 19, Pertamina plead that in any event it would be contrary to the comity of friendly states and contrary to international public policy as well as to the domestic public policy of both Indonesia and Singapore to cause or allow or permit the proceeds of crime or breach of duty to be paid to or used to the advantage of the wrongdoer, his family, heirs, or successors or anyone else who was a party or privy to his wrongdoing. On the contrary, Pertamina plead that the sums in issue or their proceeds should be directed to be paid to the victim of the wrongdoing, namely, Pertamina. Both Mrs Kartika Thahir and the estate generally deny this paragraph.
The following are the reliefs which Pertamina claim: 
 
 
(i) A declaration that all the moneys represented by the ACU deposit accounts in Sumitomo in the name of HA Thahir and/or Kartika Ratna Thahir belong to the plaintiffs absolutely. 
 
(ii) Alternatively a declaration that the said ACU deposit accounts at Sumitomo in the name of HA Thahir and/or Kartika Ratna Thahir are held subject to a trust in favour of the plaintiffs and not otherwise. 
 
(iii) Alternatively a declaration that the plaintiffs are absolutely entitled to the ACU deposit accounts at Sumitomo or the proceeds thereof as being moneys had and received to the plaintiffs` use. 
 
(iv) A declaration that the said moneys being the proceeds of crime or otherwise obtained unlawfully and/or in breach of duty by the said Thahir should not be disposed of otherwise than to the plaintiffs. 
 
(v) Alternatively a declaration that Kartika Ratna Thahir, having assisted Thahir in his dishonest and fraudulent design and/or having participated therein is in any event liable to the plaintiffs as a constructive trustee of the sums standing to the credit of the said ACU deposit accounts. 
 
(vi) An order that the said ACU deposits or the proceeds thereof be paid out to the order of the plaintiffs and Sumitomo Bank Ltd be thereupon and not otherwise discharged from all further liability to any person in respect thereof. 
 The material facts 
 (a) Pertamina
  
 
 
On 20 August 1968 `PN Pertamina` was incorporated by Law No 44 of 1968. It was a statutory fusion of two existing companies, viz Permina and Pertamina which were engaged in the oil and oil-related industries. On 15 September 1971 Pertamina, the present plaintiffs, were created by Law No 8 of 1971. Since 1968 and at all material times the predecessors of and later Pertamina themselves became the single largest and most powerful industrial concern and through them a number of state undertakings were undertaken, funded and completed. Pertamina had the necessary financial resources, but the evidence indicated that the quality of management and control was far from being satisfactory. One such undertaking was the gigantic development of the Cilegon industrial complex for steel-making and related industries, which encompassed the redevelopment of the steel-making plant in Cilegon, northwest of Java, Indonesia. That steel plant was started initially with Russian assistance. But work on it was discontinued following the attempted coup d`etat in Indonesia.
In 1970 the government of Indonesia, anticipating that its national demand would be about 3.5m tons of crude steel by 1982, decided to revive the Cilegon steel plant and develop a national iron and steel industrial complex over a site of about 2,300ha for the complex and allied industries. On 31 August 1970 PTKS was incorporated by Law No 35 of 1970 and its task was to build the infrastructure, comprising the harbour, water and power supply and a railway line to connect the harbour to the steel mill. PTKS was also responsible for the development of the steel plant. The development plan had three phases, viz (1) from 1973 to 1976 to complete the former Cilegon project, and install a metallurgical plant for the production of billets, cold rolling mills, a continuous wire rod mill and a pipe-making plant; (2) secondly, from 1976 to 1979 to install bar mills and a hot strip mill; and (3) from 1979 to 1982 to extend some of the metallurgical mills.
Pertamina was financially responsible for and, as will be elaborated later, they paid for the infrastructure facilities. In many cases, they contracted for the building of the infrastructure facilities. These facilities may be broadly described as follows: (1) a new power generation equipment which was required to provide the vast quantity of electricity required for the new electric arc furnaces to produce the steel; (2) an improved water supply system to provide sufficient water for the steel mills and the allied industries; and (3) a new harbour and a new railway link for the import of the raw materials required for the steel-making process and for the export of the finished products. As will be seen later, it was Siemens which contracted to provide the power generation equipment and Klockner and its related companies which contracted to build and supply the water supply system, the railway and the harbour.
So far as Pertamina`s implementation of the infrastructure is concerned,
Mr Toerki Witoelar, a mechanical engineer, gave the following evidence. He said that the preparation, planning and construction of the steel mill proper were handled by a team of engineers from within PTKS. He was appointed project officer in June/July 1973 and was a member of the team of officers from Pertamina responsible for the construction of the infrastructure facilities. He testified that in fact and in practice Pertamina as from about June 1973 took over effective management and control of the construction of the infrastructure facilities in Cilegon. Pertamina`s officers formed the team. He was appointed the head of engineering and operations of the complex. In fact, he was the site superintendent. However, the position was only formalized by the board of directors of Pertamina by a resolution dated 28 November 1974 by which the Pertamina Infrastructure Division was formally created. General Sutowo was the head of the division. He was supposed to report to General Sutowo and General Thahir. In practice, he could not see General Sutowo as General Sutowo was very busy. Often, he was diverted to and reported to General Thahir who was formally appointed by General Sutowo only on 3 January 1975 as `executive in charge of daily affairs of Cilegon Infrastructures Division`. Toerki Witoelar said that he had meetings with Klockner`s personnel in late 1973. He was at Pertamina`s office on one occasion and he saw a group of Germans. General Thahir instructed him to negotiate with them. Pertamina was represented by Mr Matarlogawa, Mr Nasution, Pertamina`s legal adviser, and Mr Arrifin Boor who was an engineer from PTKS. Toerki Witoelar said the meetings lasted some three or four days and he saw his tasks as ensuring that the technical aspects of the contracts with Klockner were in order. He said he was instructed by General Thahir, as if on the spur of the moment, to join his colleagues in the negotiations because he happened to be in the office. He was not briefed in advance; nor was he given any technical documents before the meetings. It was during the meetings that the Klockner personnel provided the technical documents. The meetings with Klockner over three or four days did not discuss the question of pricing at all.
Mr Ibrahim Martalogawa, a Pertamina employee who was seconded to PT Petrajasa and who had worked in the head office of Pertamina from 1978 until his retirement in 1982, gave evidence on the initial history of Permina and later the structural organization of Pertamina, and on his role in the Krakatau steel project. Like Mr Toerki Witoelar, he also identified many of Pertamina`s documents and contracts which were produced in court. He had a vast experience in assisting management in the petroleum business. He had worked for PT Shell Indonesia, which was acquired and taken over by Permina. After Pertamina`s takeover, he worked in PT Petrajasa, a subsidiary of Pertamina. He was responsible to provide housing and to meet the needs of expatriates who worked for Pertamina`s foreign contractors. His immediate superior was General Thahir. His relationship with General Thahir was not comfortable. He said that General Sutowo, as head of Permina, in the early days had recruited rather inexperienced engineers to head various divisions. At the initial stage, there were three oil companies in Indonesia. In 1962/3 Indonesia produced about 400-450 thousand barrels of oil per day. After the coup d`etat, the three companies were merged into Pertamina. Over the next ten years, Pertamina successfully achieved oil production at 11U2m barrels a day. He said Pertamina`s administrative capacity was very wanting. The management was very loose and there was no job description, no clear lines of authority and no delegation of financial authority. This situation continued, despite the attempts in 1974/5 to maintain some sort of internal audit and produce a budget. There were still signs of poor management up to 1980. He said that this situation lent itself to abuse by officers who did not work for the best interest of Pertamina. For instance, he said that General Thahir, being an ambitious and dominant personality, could and did exercise the power and authority of other officers. He cited one instance when General Thahir used the name of General Sutowo and ordered the purchase of six houses by Pertamina in order to provide parking space for the Oil Centre building which Pertamina built in Jakarta.
Mr Ibrahim Martalogawa told this court how General Sutowo worked. He would only deal with specific matters of Pertamina through certain designated officers. For instance, in matters of supply of materials to Pertamina, the `best bet` was to go through General Thahir. One had to go through General Thahir before one could get a contract. However, he did not think that General Thahir could influence General Sutowo, as General Thahir would like others to think. He said General Sutowo was a very good entrepreneur but his weakness was his lack of management skills.
He then described his role in relation to Pertamina`s negotiations with Klockner for the Krakatau steel project. General Thahir instructed him, on one day`s notice, to join Pertamina`s team as mentioned by Mr Toerki Witoelar to negotiate with Klockner in respect of the harbour, the railway link and the water supply link to the steel mill. General Thahir told him to complete the negotiations with despatch as the Germans wanted to return home. They were to negotiate on the technical aspects of the contracts and not the financial or pricing issues. He thought he was chosen, not for his technical expertise, but because of his experience of having worked for PT Shell Indonesia and for the reasons that he could communicate with Klockner in English and that he could get along with foreigners. He was not aware that Pertamina had called for any tender. He expressed the view that for such a substantial project, PT Shell Indonesia would have called for tenders. Pertamina`s team had no documents, technical or otherwise, and they used those provided by Klockner. Klockner were represented by 11 or 12 Germans. He remembered that they discussed the technical drawings. The negotiations took three to four days. But he remembered that the master list containing all the technical items, which were necessary for the import permit, were left to be finalized between the Germans and Mr Toerki Witoelar. After those negotiations, Mr Ibrahim Martalogawa himself was not involved in the project proper at all except for initialling the relevant contracts which he identified. As leader of the team he initialled to confirm Pertamina`s agreement.
On 29 March 1973 Pertamina entered into a contract with Siemens who agreed to supply one diesel power station of four sets each 9,500KVA complete with all necessary equipment at the contract price of DM34.85m fob European seaport. It was intended for PTKS. Copies of the provisions of the agreement are in exh E3/140-195. By an agreement dated 16 August 1973 between Pertamina and Siemens, Siemens agreed to supply to PTKS one complete steam power station 240MW, complete with all necessary equipment and including erection works. The total price of the contract material and services was DM394,822,400. Copies of the provisions of this agreement are in exh E3/196-310. I should interpose to note the fact that Matches 4, 5, 6 and 8, which were set out in Annexure B in the statement of claim were proved on the evidence to relate to this agreement of 16 August 1973 entered into between Pertamina and Siemens.
By another agreement dated 4 May 1974 between PTKS and Siemens, the parties agreed to sell and purchase an extension of the power generation and power distribution plant. Siemens agreed to supply one complete steam power station of 160MW together with the necessary equipment and to render the services as specified in Annex A to that contract. The total contract price for the material and services was DM573,703,700. Copies of this agreement are set out in exh E3/311-430. I should also interpose to note the fact that Matches 7, 9 and 10, which were set out in Annexure B in the statement of claim, were proved on the evidence to relate to this agreement entered into between PTKS and Siemens.
By a contract dated 23 January 1974 between Pertamina and Klockner, Klockner agreed to supply to Pertamina (1) the plant, equipment, machinery and equipment required for the harbour at Cilegon, Indonesia, having a capacity for berthing 50,000ton deadweight bulk carriers; (2) the handling and conveying facilities on the pier and on shore; (3) the railway line for connecting the harbour with an existing railway line; and (4) for the water supply facilities. The contract prices were:(a) for the harbour and the handling plant on the pier and on shore, the sum of DM106,805,300; (b) for the railway line, the sum of DM60,437,200; and (c) for the water supply facilities, the sum of DM301.99m. The total contract sum was DM469,232,500. The evidence satisfied me that this contract was backdated to 23 January 1974. Copies of the contract are set out in exh E3/17-44. I was also satisfied on the evidence that Matches 1, 2 and 3, which were set out in Annexure B of the statement of claim, related to this contract.
The engineering and civil works which related to Klockner`s three enormous constituents of the infrastructure were entrusted by Pertamina under an agreement also dated 23 January 1974 to a joint venture between Ed Zublin AG and Grun & Bilfinger AG. The total contract sum was DM92,678,565 and for present purposes the joint venture may be regarded as having operated under the umbrella of Klockner.
On 14 May 1974 PTKS entered into a contract with Siemens for the supervision, erection and commissioning of the power station which was covered by one of the Pertamina contracts with Siemens.
Klockner and Siemens under their contracts with Pertamina and PTKS from time to time supplied the materials and rendered the services. In early 1975, however, Pertamina encountered a serious financial crisis. The government of Indonesia decided that Pertamina should no longer have carriage of the development of the Krakatau steel project and the industrial complex in Cilegon. General Sutowo ceased to be the president director of Pertamina. By Presidential Decree No 13 of 1975 dated 17 April 1975, Dr JB Sumarlin, the Minister of Order and Perfecting of State Apparatuses and Vice Chairman of Bappenas, was directed by the President of Indonesia to review the Krakatau steel project and renegotiate with the contractors, including Klockner and Siemens. Siemens renegotiated their contracts and all their contracts were substituted by the renegotiated contract dated 21 January 1976. Klockner renegotiated with PTKS directly and that renegotiated contract was dated 23 January 1976.
I should briefly deal with the question of accounting between Pertamina and the government of Indonesia in relation to what Pertamina had expended on the Krakatau steel project and the infrastructure in Cilegon, Indonesia. As between them, it was established as common ground in these proceedings that some US$585m was incurred by Pertamina and that sum was set off against the liabilities which Pertamina were owing the government of Indonesia. (b) General Thahir
General Thahir was born on 12 November 1912 in Palembang, Indonesia. He went through elementary and junior high school after which he completed the Intermediate Commercial Education in Palembang. He joined the army in 1945. By 1949 he became a Colonel and was the Chief of Staff of Finance of the Sumatra Command in Bukit Tinggi. He retired from the Indonesian Armed Forces, having risen to the rank of Brigadier-General. From 1950 he retired from the army at his own request and engaged in several businesses , including import and export. General Thahir was very close to General Sutowo because they had fought alongside each other against the Dutch colonial government. According to his own curricular vitae dated December 1969, he became the adviser of the president director of Permina, which was the forerunner of Pertamina, General Sutowo in 1966. In fact, he was appointed as the assistant to the board of Permina which were his employers. In the following year, he was appointed as the personal assistant of the president director. By that appointment, he obviously worked closely and directly under General Sutowo. In March 1968 General Thahir was appointed as caretaker Director of Finance and Accounting of Permina. He had obviously considerable control and authority over matters of finance and accounting within Permina. Five months later, Pertamina was incorporated as noted earlier. It became at all material times the single largest industrial concern in Indonesia. General Sutowo as its president director wielded immense power and influence.
On 14 October 1968 General Thahir was appointed as general assistant to the president director. He headed the list of other appointees who were themselves heads of various substantial divisions within Pertamina, such as foreign marketing, tankers and the co-ordinating division for foreign contractors. In the following month and during the absence of the president director, General Thahir was authorized to sign all letters of transfer and all letters on behalf of Pertamina. For those working within Pertamina and to those dealing with Pertamina, it was made known through Pertamina`s News of July 1969, for example, that General Thahir was empowered and entrusted with the duties `to assist in ensuring the smooth performance of the daily duties in meeting the requirements in the purchase of materials and working equipment within and without the country` and `to assist in ensuring the smooth performance of the duties in protecting the assets, activities and officials of [Pertamina]`. These duties of General Thahir undoubtedly encompassed the infrastructure facilities which were eventually constructed for the Cilegon industrial complex. As an example of General Thahir`s position and power, he was also appointed as the executive commissioner of PT Pelita Air Service which took care of Pertamina`s needs for transportation by air. On 17 October 1970 General Thahir was instructed in writing to assist General Sutowo in performing purchasing control under the standing operation procedure. In other words, it was his responsibility to ensure purchases of the right quantity and quality at competitive prices and their timely delivery within the budget. On 21 January 1971 General Thahir issued the internal directive, undoubtedly I infer with the approval of General Sutowo, that all purchase orders of Pertamina had to be approved and initialled by him personally before they were submitted to General Sutowo for his approval and signature. A year later, General Thahir was, in addition to his other duties, placed at the disposal of the Director of Administration and Finance. Four months later, he was authorized to sign cash vouchers and cash demands for all contracts which had been signed by the president director. It would not be difficult to see how he could by virtue of this position ensure payment to or withhold payment from any contractor if he was inclined to. According to Mr Ibrahim Martalogawa, he overheard General Thahir giving instructions to Mr Nur Usman of the Finance Department to pay a certain gentleman by saying that it was the instruction of General Sutowo. On 3 January 1975 General Thahir was appointed by the board of directors of Pertamina to be the executive manager of the Cilegon Infrastructure Division of Pertamina. Again documenting the appointment followed long after the fact of the appointment.
In addition to proving Pertamina`s documents regarding their payments to Klockner and Siemens, Mr Nur Usman, who was treasurer in the Foreign Currency Department of Pertamina since 1972, said in evidence that he reported to his immediate superior, Mr Anondo, and also to General Thahir. Mr Anondo is very advanced in age and was unable to come to Singapore to give evidence. He said in evidence that after every payment to Klockner and Siemens, he would verbally report to General Thahir. He did so because General Thahir was responsible for the Krakatau steel project. In cross-examination, he confirmed that General Thahir as the general assistant of the president director wielded great influence not only in respect of the Krakatau steel project but in other Pertamina`s projects such as the Convention Hall project in Jakarta and many others where equipment was bought from abroad. He also revealed that General Thahir had ordered him to pay Klockner and Siemens when the instalments fell due. If the cash flow did not permit, he would as he did pay the sums due by a number of instalment payments. Mr Nur Usman also said in evidence that Klockner and Siemens had procured their contracts with Pertamina and PTKS through the influence of General Thahir. He confirmed that he had, for example, met the team from Siemens in the office of General Thahir. He also said that General Thahir had numerous discussions with officers of Pertamina in relation to the Krakatau steel project.
I was quite satisfied on the evidence that the duties of General Thahir were during the corresponding period far more responsible and extensive than many top chief executive directors or officers of many of the top companies in the corporate world. Most of all, it cannot be over-emphasized that the Cilegon industrial complex, including the Krakatau steel project, was a government project which was undertaken for the public common good of Indonesia.
At this juncture, it would be convenient to refer to the proceedings which Mrs Kartika Thahir commenced in 1977 against Sumitomo Bank Ltd in Japan to recover the ACU deposits. The narrative which follows is a summary of what Mrs Kartika Thahir herself had asserted in those proceedings. She claimed that General Thahir was in his lifetime an `important person in the financial and political circle` in Indonesia. She revealed that around August 1972 General Thahir had an important meeting in Singapore with Mr Shozo Hotta, the chairman of the bank. She said that the bank repeatedly entreated her and her husband to open a joint account in the bank because General Thahir `owned an enormous fortune`. In the absence of any evidence from Mrs Kartika Thahir, the inference must be that it was the couple that had in August 1972 informed Mr Shozo Hotta that General Thahir was enormously rich. Secondly, the analysis of the pleadings filed in this case does not disclose any assertion, and therefore no evidence whatsoever was led by Mrs Kartika Thahir, to prove that in August 1972 General Thahir and/or Mrs Kartika Thahir had already owned any fortune of the magnitude approaching the size of the ACU deposits which were later placed with the Singapore branch of the bank, beginning from May 1973, the following year. Since General Thahir had worked for a considerable period of time and had been in business, I do accept that the couple had amassed some fortune. But I am far from persuaded that by August 1972 or by May 1973 the couple had owned more than a fraction of the total ACU deposits. I am further ineluctably driven to infer that by August 1972, and certainly before the first ACU deposit was made in May 1973, General Thahir to the knowledge of Mrs Kartika Thahir had every reason to believe and entertained the expectation that General Thahir would be receiving substantial sums of money. Mrs Kartika Thahir elected to stay away from the witness box and has not explained to this court any legitimate source of the ACU deposits which were eventually placed with the bank in Singapore.
She further alleged that around May 1974 she and General Thahir met
Mr Shozo Hotta again. The meeting was in Tokyo. An agreement was reached to open the joint account. She alleged that it was agreed: (1) that secrecy of the depositors and security of the deposits shall be maintained in the same way as in Switzerland; (2) that either of the couple may at any time withdraw any deposit without the consent of the other; and (3) that the survivor of the couple may freely withdraw the balance of the deposits. Mrs Kartika Thahir explained in the Japanese proceedings that both of them had stressed the right of withdrawal by the survivor because the couple was legally married only on 29 July 1974, although they had lived as man and wife for five years before that date. She was anxious, as she admitted, to pre-empt any argument about the right to inheritance, seeing that the joint account was already opened, as she then claimed, on 10 June 1974. I am accordingly driven to the conclusion that Mrs Kartika Thahir knew that General Thahir was soon to come into a huge fortune and she was actively taking steps to ensure that she would obtain a good part, if not the whole, of it. I also cannot help but agree with Mr Hunt in his observation that often, though not always, secrecy is the badge of fraud.
The version from the bank came from the affidavit of Mr Akira Fujimine who was their general manager of the Singapore branch from 30 April 1975 to 31 October 1977. The bank denied that the deposit accounts were established as a consequence of the meeting with Mr Hotta and they further denied that it was at Mr Hotta`s suggestion that the couple decided to open the ACU account. The August 1972 meeting with Mr Hotta was not denied; only the effect of that meeting was in dispute. The bank`s deponent went on to say that he had been informed by Mr Yamaura, who was at all material times the general manager of the Singapore branch, that it was sometime in 1973, after Mr Yamaura had come to know General Thahir through business negotiations, that General Thahir informed Mr Yamaura that he, General Thahir, had some considerable amount of deposits with some other banks and that he could transfer them to the Singapore branch of the bank. I have to observe at this stage that this court has not seen evidence from Mrs Kartika Thahir that the sources of the ACU deposits in question in truth and in fact had emanated from any of General Thahir`s pre-existing deposits with some other banks. This inevitably raises the question why General Thahir had proffered that self-serving representation, the truth of which has been unsupported by any evidence at all.
It was in evidence that the first deposit in the series was made on 25 May 1973, and that thereafter before the end of May 1974, ten other deposits were made in the name of General Thahir. According to the bank`s deponent, and this was not disputed, the following transactions took place. In the beginning of June 1974 General Thahir visited the Singapore branch and opened a joint fixed deposit account in the names of General Thahir and Mrs Kartika Thahir. It was for the sum of DM2,273,478.46 which was accepted by the Singapore branch on 10 June 1974. By the end of 1975 the Singapore branch had in total 19 deposits, all of which with the exception of one was in the sole name of General Thahir. Sometime in the latter part of 1975 after Mr Fujimine had become the general manager, General Thahir visited him, accompanied by Mrs Kartika Thahir. At this visit, General Thahir requested the bank to transfer all the deposits in his sole name to a joint fixed deposit account in the names of General Thahir and Mrs Kartika Thahir. On the written instructions of General Thahir, which Mr Fujimine required, the transfer of the fixed deposits into the joint account was effected by the bank after 19 January 1976.
(c) Mrs Kartika Thahir`s admissions
General Moerdani, Minister of Defence and Security of the Republic of Indonesia gave the following evidence. In May 1977 he was instructed by the President of Indonesia to recover what was believed to be bribes taken by General Thahir. He established contact with Mrs Kartika Thahir after writing to her. He had six meetings with her in Geneva, Switzerland, as she was not prepared to meet him in Jakarta, Indonesia. They first met in July 1977 in the office of a Swiss lawyer. A number of people attended that meeting. It was held on a `without prejudice` basis. Following that meeting, General Moerdani wrote to Mrs Kartika Thahir suggesting that they meet. He also suggested that he did not wish to have other parties not directly concerned with the matter being present at the meeting `in order to best conclude this matter`. Mrs Kartika Thahir replied and suggested that they meet around 17 or 18 September 1977. They met in his hotel room in the Inter-Continental Hotel, Geneva, Switzerland. General Moerdani was accompanied by Mr Ibrahim Thahir and Mr Mawati, a Notary of Indonesia and a personal friend of Mrs Kartika Thahir. Her daughter, Ms Faridah Thahir, accompanied her. Mrs Kartika Thahir gave General Moerdani the impression that she regarded him as a reasonable person who could help solve the problem. After a while, General Moerdani and Mrs Kartika Thahir were left alone in the room; the others went to the coffee house of the hotel. In the room, Mrs Kartika Thahir mentioned that Mr Ibrahim Thahir was very greedy, that the money belonged to her and that they should meet again, but only the two of them. General Moerdani agreed to the proposal. At this meeting, Mrs Kartika Thahir did not mention anything about the source of the money in Sumitomo Bank.
They met the following day. At first, Ms Faridah Thahir was present. It took place in the coffee house of Hotel Le Resident, just outside Geneva. After a while, Ms Faridah Thahir left them and went for a walk in the garden. General Moerdani testified that Mrs Kartika Thahir then told him a number of things, most of which were new to him. First, she told him that the money at the Singapore branch of Sumitomo Bank came from the Krakatau steel project, which General Moerdani said was a government project managed and funded by Pertamina. She further told him that the account at the bank was `some sort of a collecting point` of moneys that had been paid by Pertamina to the principal contractors who were Siemens and Klockner. She specifically mentioned that DM15m came from Siemens and DM35m came from Klockner and that payments were made every time Pertamina made a payment to its contractors and that it amounted to 21% at that particular time. Mrs Kartika Thahir also told General Moerdani that this account would further be split into three equal parts. One would go, according to Mrs Kartika Thahir, to General Sutowo, another one to Mr Junus Rani and the third to General Thahir. She further disclosed to General Moerdani that there were two other accounts at the Singapore branches of Chase Manhattan Bank and the Hong Kong Bank but the amounts were relatively small. She said the accounts were `to cover daily spending money`. It amounted to US$1.2m. Mrs Kartika Thahir further disclosed that `50-something million Deutschmarks` in Singapore was only one third or one half of all the moneys that should be paid into the account of General Thahir and that one third, meaning another sum of DM50m, was already in a bank in Munich, Germany, but this sum was not transferred to General Thahir`s account in Singapore because General Thahir passed away.
Mrs Kartika Thahir also revealed to General Moerdani that her contacts in PT Krakatau Steel was a certain 
 Mr Haller and a Mr Mazur 
 . However, she did not tell him which organizations those two particular individuals were with.
General Moerdani said in evidence that before that meeting he did not know that the source of the money was the PT Krakatau steel project. All he knew was that the money amounted to about DM50m and US$1.2m in another bank or in two other banks; nor did he know that the principal contractors were Siemens and Klockner. He also had not heard of the names of 
 Haller 
 or 
 Mazur 
 . They were employees of the German contractors stationed in Jakarta.
General Moerdani also told this court that before her disclosures, he had offered Mrs Kartika Thahir two options. One was that she surrendered the whole amount to the Indonesian government and she would receive an amount or reward or a bonus at the discretion of the Indonesian government. The second was that she surrendered the whole amount at Sumitomo Bank to the Indonesian government and she would get the interest, starting from the day the money was deposited until 1 January 1977 or the first day of the following year, depending on how long the case would take. She rejected both. General Moerdani even offered to escort her and her children to Indonesia so that she could return the money personally to the government. She counter-proposed that she should get the money in Singapore and that she would escort him to Munich and introduce him to the right people at Munich who would be able to give him the DM50m that she mentioned before. He turned this down.
General Moerdani then produced two original documents to the court, copies of which are in exhs E8/77 and 78. Both of them had used those pieces of paper while they were talking at the coffee house at Le Hotel Resident. Turning to exh E8/78 General Moerdani said he wrote the first column, which was headed by `I` in a circle, except for the circle around the words `JA` and two curving strokes which, he thought, were made by Mrs Kartika Thahir. He also wrote on the second column headed by `II` and the third column headed by `III` written within a smaller circle and the word `Jakarta`. He said that she wrote the bigger circle and the cross over his writings in the third column. Towards the bottom of the page and just under the second column, Mrs Kartika Thahir wrote the words `Hallal T` and `Mazur` with a letter to the right. She also wrote the diagram on the right.
General Moerdani then explained that the first column represented his first option which he offered. Having examined the original, General Moerdani told the court that what was written and later deleted appeared to be the figure 53,000 or 50,000. He said he had written either of the two figures; he could not say who had written the deletion. He said that the figure meant million and not thousand and that it referred to the 50 million in Sumitomo Bank. He said that the writing `S-K-M` meant Siemens and Klockner. As for `M`, it could be 
 Mazur 
 but he mentioned that he was only guessing. He indicated that the truth was that he could not remember. As for the words `JA`, he said it was the joint account in the bank and the circle and the two curving strokes recorded her indication that it was a collecting point for moneys that were put in by the two contractors.
Turning to the second column, General Moerdani told the court that the figure `50,000` signified the total of the money which Klockner and Siemens had put in the bank. It meant 50 million. The words `S:15` and `K:35` referred to the amounts put in by Siemens and Klockner. He got the figures from Mrs Kartika Thahir. He could not recall the signification of the word `Yusuf` below those entries. As for the circle and cross which Mrs Kartika Thahir had written in the third column, he could not recall their significance.
He found out later that the name of a German called `Hallal` must be `Haller` in German. The other name was Mazur. Referring to the diagram, General Moerdani told the court that the circle in the centre was the account and the other smaller circular points around it and the lines linking those small circles to the centre represented the moneys which were put into the account to be distributed amongst the three persons she had mentioned.
As for exh E8/77, General Moerdani said that the figure `35` was written by him; the rest of the handwriting was Mrs Kartika Thahir`s. He could not remember the significance of what she had written there; nor the significance of the figure `35`.
General Moerdani then produced two original documents, copies of which appear in exh E8/75 and 76. They were his notes which he made after his meeting with Mrs Kartika Thahir. They could have been made on the same day in his hotel room or on the following day in the aircraft. Some of the entries were in different coloured inks. In both documents, he set out option one and option two. Lower on the original document of E8/76 General Moerdani recorded in red ink the following in Indonesian: 
 
GVA 19 and 20 September 1977
 
 
 
* Ask for option #2
 
 
 
* H Thahir`s possessions in Singapore and Jakarta are about the same. In Jakarta plenty, practically all in the form of immovable assets.
 
 
 
* Due payments by S + K are DM15m and DM35m respectively.
 
 
 
* The money in the Sumitomo Bank is deposited on an annual basis that can be withdrawn at the end of each month.
 
 
 
* As to money in the Chase Manhattan and the Hongkong Banks, the amount is small/money for daily expenses.
 
 
 
General Moerdani explained that `GVA` meant Geneva and that the meeting took place before the two dates stated there. It was the meeting at Hotel Resident. He said by his first note, he meant to record his intention to ask Mrs Kartika Thahir to accept option two. The second entry merely recorded down what Mrs Kartika Thahir had told him previously. He understood that her purpose was to tell him that both families of the late General Thahir were left with about the same amount of money and property. The next entry referred to the money that was still kept in Munich which she told him to collect. The last entries recorded what she had told him. General Moerdani also told the court that, as recorded by him, Mrs Kartika Thahir had rejected both the options. He could not recall if she had rejected the options in a talk with him or through her daughter.
General Moerdani told the court that Mrs Kartika Thahir regarded her late husband as a private businessman, although he was an employee of Pertamina. She could not understand that as a government official, he could not receive commissions. He denied her allegations in her defence that he had told her in the presence of her daughter that `while it was no secret while he was alive that General Thahir received and held for his private use the funds represented by the ACU deposits it was not right for the widow to keep so large a fund for her private use`. He tried to tell her that he could not imagine one person could own so much money and that it was not right for her to keep the money. He said it was not common knowledge while General Thahir was alive that General Thahir received and held for his private use the funds represented by the ACU deposits.
The profound importance of the evidence of General Moerdani is appreciated by both sides. Mr Eder sought to undermine the effect of General Moerdani`s evidence by a three-pronged attack. The cross-examination and his submissions concentrated on (a) the discrepancies between the further and better particulars furnished by Pertamina and the evidence of General Moerdani; (b) the inconsistencies between Mr Hunt`s opening on this subject and General Moerdani`s evidence; and (c) certain parts of General Moerdani`s evidence which detract from any finding that Mrs Kartika Thahir had made the incriminatory admissions as alleged. I turn first to the discrepancies between the pleadings and General Moerdani`s evidence. Pertamina had averred that Mrs Kartika had made the admissions to General Moerdani in October 1977, which was later amended to September 1977, and that it was made at the lobby of Hotel Resident, Geneva, Switzerland. They further alleged that she had made the admissions to one
Mr Suji, who did not give evidence. Though there are inconsistencies, these were more attributable to precision of draftmanship, and in any case, they are quite immaterial. It also matters not that Mr Suji was not called by Pertamina. If
Mrs Kartika Thahir thinks that this approach is of any evidential effect, the question has to be asked why she did not in her own defence aver that the crucial meeting between her and General Moerdani had taken place in November 1977, and not September 1977, as Mr Eder had repeatedly put to General Moerdani in cross-examination. This line of attack did not in my view undermine the main thrust and effect of her clear admissions to General Moerdani. As for the contrast between Mr Hunt`s opening with General Moerdani`s evidence, I am satisfied that there is nothing in the point. I turn to the cross-examination of General Moerdani, which not unexpectedly was sustained and intensive. Mr Eder at one point managed to get General Moerdani to agree that the figures of 15 million and 35 million which Mrs Kartika Thahir was talking about were not the amounts in the account in Sumitomo Bank. However, looking at the relevant parts of the cross-examination, I am quite satisfied that General Moerdani was in giving that answer confused because he was referred to two of his four documents and he was then having in mind the sum of DM50m in a bank in Munich, which of course was not the money in Sumitomo Bank. Further, General Moerdani`s later evidence in cross-examination reaffirmed his evidence on the admissions of Mrs Kartika Thahir. It also came through clearly to me that General Moerdani in dividing up the DM50m in a bank in Munich into DM15m and DM35m as having being paid by Siemens and Klockner merely made that inference on his part, having regard to her disclosures that the Deutschmarks deposits in Singapore were made up in those proportions. It was to me quite an understandable deduction, although its validity as a matter of strict logic is quite another matter. I have to emphasize that Mr Eder did not cross-examine General Moerdani to any effect on exhs E8/77 and 78. He also made the suggestion to General Moerdani that it was not the truth that Mrs Kartika Thahir had drawn the diagram and had written Hallal and Mazur. I need hardly say that a suggestion put to a witness is not evidence unless it is admitted, which there was none, and as I had said earlier, this court did not have the advantage of hearing and therefore assessing any evidence of Mrs Kartika Thahir. It is also of considerable significance that General Moerdani was not questioned on the figures which were recorded in exh E8/78 at the crucial meeting and on which both General Moerdani and Mrs Kartika Thahir had made their handwritten contributions. In the result, I had before me rather inconsequential questions by Mr Eder on that important contemporaneous document and a host of critical questions which were not put to General Moerdani. The deafening silence tells against Mrs Kartika Thahir. In the circumstances, I am compelled to reject Mr Eder`s criticisms of General Moerdani`s evidence. I should also add that General Moerdani`s composure and equanimity, in the face of repeated suggestions that his evidence had no coincidence in fact, rather impressed me. Throughout he remained a gentleman and did not in any way denigrate Mrs Kartika Thahir nor did he return measure for measure. At the end of the day, I was left in no doubt that he was clearly and unquestionably undergirded by the armour of truth. I have no hesitation in accepting his evidence as the whole truth. I therefore find as a fact that Mrs Kartika Thahir did admit to General Moerdani that the moneys in Sumitomo Bank came from Siemens as to DM15m and Klockner as to DM35m.
(d) Are the ACU deposits bribes?
One of the central questions of fact in this case is whether each of the 19 ACU deposits, as particularized in Annexure A of the statement of claim, are proceeds of bribes which Siemens and Klockner had paid General Thahir in relation to the Krakatau steel project or any other projects of Pertamina which Pertamina allegedly undertook for their own account or on behalf of PTKS. Pertamina seeks to prove that all the ACU deposits were the proceeds of bribes by the following evidence. Those evidence have been compendiously summarized in para 9(i)- (xi) of the statement of claim which, in my view, repays the most careful reading in the light of the evidence. Mrs Kartika`s defence, on the other hand, is also compendiously set out in para 10(i)-(ix), within which sub-paras 10(vii) and (viii) have been deleted. In considering whether Pertamina have discharged their legal and evidential burden, including the higher standard of proof in a case of this nature, it will be necessary also to bear in mind para 9 in the context of her entire defence.
The legal and evidential burden of proof that Pertamina paid Siemens and Klockner rests on Pertamina, as Pertamina accept. However, the questions whether Pertamina have discharged both the legal and evidential burden in respect of each of Pertamina`s alleged payments to Siemens and Klockner are very much in controversy. It is submitted on behalf of Mrs Kartika that a part of Pertamina`s allegations involve allegations of a fraudulent or criminal nature and that as a matter of the law of evidence it is necessary for Pertamina to prove their case to a high standard, which is higher than the standard in a non-fraud case: see 
 Hornal v Neuberger Products 
 ;1 
 Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij NV (Netherlands Trading Society) v Koh Kim Guan 
 2 where Rose CJ said at p 175: `Whatever the precise formula adopted and whatever the theoretical position may be, it has long been the practice in countries where the English system of law operates for the courts, in civil cases, to require a high standard of proof in cases where fraud is alleged.`; and 
 Tan Chye Chew & Anor v Eastern Mining and Metals Co Ltd 
 .3 However, it should be noted that it is not the law of evidence that every step in the allegation of fraud has to be proved by calling live and admissible evidence nor is it the law that fraud cannot be inferred in the appropriate case. In 
 Tan Chye Chew 
 ,3 for instance, the court was not dealing with the standard of proof and it seems to me clear from a reading of that case that it is no authority for the proposition, which appears to be suggested on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir, that fraud cannot be inferred. This is not to say that inferences of this serious nature should be lightly made. The circumstantial evidence must be so compelling and convincing that bearing in mind the high standard of proof one is nevertheless satisfied that an inference of fraud is justified. It will therefore be necessary to consider the evidence, if any.
First, Pertamina say that they have evidence to prove that they had from time to time paid Siemens and Klockner pursuant to the terms of payments set out in their contracts or PTKS`s contracts with Siemens and Klockner for materials supplied and work done in relation to the Krakatau steel mill and the infrastructures in the Cilegon industrial complex. These payments are particularized in Annexure B of the statement of claim.
Secondly, Pertamina say that General Thahir had deposited each of the 19 ACU deposits. Happily, Mrs Kartika Thahir conceded, as she reluctantly but inevitably had to in the face of the documents which were produced in court by Sumitomo Bank. These documents prove the gross amount of each ACU deposit made by General Thahir and the precise date on which each ACU deposit was made.
Thirdly, Pertamina contend that as a matter of fact Klockner had paid General Thahir the bribes at the rate of 13% of each of Pertamina`s payments so far as Matches 1, 2 and 3 are concerned; that Siemens had in truth and in fact paid General Thahir the bribes at the rate of 5% of each of Pertamina`s payment so far as Matches 4-10 are concerned; that Siemens had in fact paid General Thahir the bribe set out in Match 11 which related to two Pertamina`s projects in the Batam Island and for which Siemens were the contractors.
Fourthly, I refer to the six ACU deposits denominated in Deutschmarks and the two ACU deposits denominated in US dollars. For reasons which will appear later, it will be necessary to treat them as two separate categories, unless otherwise stated in this judgment. Pertamina`s case with regard to these two groups of ACU deposits is as follows. In the first place, they say the inevitable inference is that all eight unmatched ACU deposits must have been bribes which were paid by Siemens and Klockner. For this contention, they rely principally on the admissions of Mrs Kartika Thahir to General Moerdani, although Mr Hunt recognizes in his closing speech that the two ACU deposits in US dollars are not `quite as straightforward as the Deutschmarks deposits`. In relation to the six unmatched Deutschmarks deposits, Pertamina also rely on a number of submissions to which I shall have to return.
I now turn to consider Pertamina`s proofs of their payments to Siemens and Klockner. For a start, I refer to those documents whose authenticity have been admitted by the solicitors of Mrs Kartika Thahir in their letter of 28 August 1991. In this connection it is most important to bear in mind that the authenticity of a document is quite different from the truth of the contents or the accuracy of that document. As for the documents, the authenticity of which is admitted by that letter, the position is that those documents are deemed to be authentic whether they are originals or copies and are to be treated as proof of their contents without more ado. With regard to those documents which are not covered by the said letter, Pertamina have to prove both their authenticity and their contents. Pertamina have to satisfy this court further that they may adduce secondary evidence and that they fall within the terms of s 67(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). Pertamina rely on the evidence of Mr Zacharia Brori. From 1971 to 1991 he worked in the Finance Directorate of Pertamina. He said that between 1971 and 1975, Pertamina did not have photocopiers. Documents used to be typed with six carbon copies. In 1976 a xerox machine was used. In 1978 he assisted the team set up to assist Pertamina to recover the ACU deposits. He went to Pertamina`s warehouse and collected the documents relating to the Krakatau steel project. He brought the documents to Mr Ronald Grund, an accountant of the accounting firm of Arthur Young, who was helping in the investigations of this case. Ronald Grund selected the documents he needed and these carbon copies were photocopied. Mr Ronald Grund told this court that after he had completed his investigations and submitted his report, he returned to Mr Brori two boxes of documents, telling him to take care of the documents. He kept the two boxes of documents in the office of PT Petrajasa. He saw the two boxes two or three months after Mr Ronald Grund had left Pertamina. In 1985 PT Petrajasa moved office and someone moved the boxes of documents. The last time he saw the two boxes of documents were in another warehouse at Senopati, Indonesia. In 1991 he assisted in retrieving as many documents as possible. He had sworn affidavits as to every document which Pertamina had produced in the process of discovery. Where only copies were available, he thought that the originals or carbon copies had been lost in transit. I accept Mr Brori`s evidence and in consequence Pertamina are entitled to adduce secondary evidence of the relevant documents. However, Pertamina are still required to prove the authenticity of these documents and the truth of their contents and that they fall within ss 65 and 67 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97).
In relation to the question of proof covering the Pertamina payments with which the eleven matched deposits were linked, it is again conceded by Mrs Kartika Thahir that there was proof of the same.
The documents which go to prove Pertamina`s payments to Siemens and Klockner are the exhibits in bundle E6. The bundle is divided into bundle E6(I) and E6(II) and they respectively encompass the payment documents in connection with the eleven matched deposits and the unmatched deposits. Mr Nur Usman, who was treasurer of the Foreign Currency Department of Pertamina responsible for payments to foreign contractors (including Siemens and Klockner) gave evidence on many of the documents in bundles E6(I) and E6(II). Other officers in the accounts section within Pertamina, namely, Mr John Pattiwael, Mr Wirioputro, Ms Maryan Sandy, Mr Bakrie, Mr Rasjid, Mr Sani and Mr Wibawa, have also identified and confirmed various documents in the two bundles.
For instance, in respect of the unmatched deposits, 20 documents evidencing Pertamina`s payments have been identified and confirmed as proof of the payments. Their evidence described the accounting records which were maintained in Pertamina at the material time. Having considered their oral evidence, I am satisfied that in truth and in fact Pertamina had paid Siemens and Klockner sums of money in respect of the Krakatau steel project and the infrastructure facilities.
Inspite of the concessions of Mrs Kartika Thahir that Pertamina had paid Siemens and Klockner so far as the eleven matched payments are concerned, it is in my view necessary to set out the principal evidence. They are as follows: 
 
 
(1) Match 1: By letter of instruction E6(I)/13, Pertamina instructed the First National City Bank of Jakarta to pay to Klockner DM75,265,200 as down payment being 18% of Addendum No I and II to the contract dated 
 
23 January 1974 covering the railway and water supply facilities. The bank in writing advised the payment, which this court admitted under s 32 of the Evidence Act. 
 
(2) Match 2: Pertamina`s payments to Klockner resulted in a possible link with this single largest ACU Deutschmarks deposit of DM12,951,900. General Thahir was given Klockner`s cheque for this amount and as evidenced by 
 
exh E7/334, he presented the same to Sumitomo Bank in Singapore and signed an application for the bank to collect the proceeds thereof for credit to his ACU account with the bank. Pursuant to Pertamina`s application, Banque Nationale De Paris (`BNP`) opened a letter of credit in favour of Klockner for DM99.63m for the railway and water supply facilities. The manuscript of 
 
Mr Muthu Palaniappan, an officer of BNP, on the letter of credit was identified by him in evidence and he confirmed that BNP debited Pertamina US$38,910,369.07. By a letter dated 16 April 1980, which was written by and signed by Mr Balasubramaniam, BNP confirmed that they had paid on behalf of Pertamina, whom they debited, the sum relevant to Match 2. This letter also confirmed payments by and for the account of Pertamina in respect of Match 3, Match 8 (the third instalment) and Match 9. 
 
(3) Match 3(i): This matched deposit together with Match 3(ii) below together total DM10,793,250 which is the second largest ACU deposit made by General Thahir with Sumitomo Bank. It is again significant to note that Klockner had handed to General Thahir the cheque for that sum and he in turn by exh E7/253 applied to the bank to collect the proceeds which he instructed the bank after collection to be placed in his ACU account. The corresponding payment by Pertamina was made through BNP`s letter of credit. Mr Muthu confirmed that Pertamina was debited. Klockner`s receipt of DM20.304m was identified by Mr Muthu and this court admitted this document under s 32 of the Evidence Act. 
 
(4) Match 3(ii): The documents satisfied me that Pertamina had paid Klockner DM62.721m. 
 
(5) Match 4: The documents proved that Pertamina paid Siemens the sum of DM39,482,240 being the first down payment of 10% of the total price of the contract material and services which related to Point IV, Addendum I of the contract dated 16 August 1973. Siemen`s receipt for this sum was admitted by me. By a letter dated 12 June 1975 Siemens wrote to Pertamina, for the attention of Mr Nur Usman. They confirmed that as of 18 April 1975 they had received a total of DM133,864,460, all of which related to Matches 4,5,6 and the first two instalments of Match 8. In the `Statement B` annexed to that letter Siemens also acknowledged the receipt of DM159,657,680 as of 
 
18 April 1975 and these sums related to Matches 7, 9 and 10. They asked for payment of several overdue and future instalments due and payable, among which was the sum of DM8,899,980, which was paid, and which was matched to Match 8(iii). 
 
(6) Match 5: By telegraphic transfer effected by the Commerce Union Bank of Nashville, Tennessee, USA, Pertamina paid Siemens DM39,482,240. Siemens issued a receipt for this sum dated 18 January 1974 and the receipt was recorded in the accounting records of Pertamina. 
 
(7) Match 6: Pertamina paid Siemens the relevant sum of DM31,899,980 as instructed by Mr Anondo who confirmed his instructions in court. Siemens by their aforesaid letter of 12 June 1975 confirmed the receipt of this sum, although Siemens wrongly recorded the month of receipt as April 1974 when it should have been July 1974. 
 
(8) Match 7: The payments to Siemen which went to correlate to Match 7 were effected by eight instalments as more particularly recorded in the documentary evidence. Some of these payments were recorded in Pertamina`s accounting records, in their `bukti bank form`. As Siemens had confirmed by their Statement B annexed to their letter of 12 June 1975, they had received the sum of DM44,916,940 which correlated to this matching. 
 
(9) Match 8: The payments by Pertamina to Siemens were by three instalments effected through Moscow Narodny Bank for DM14m and DM9m on or about 6 March 1975 for the power generation and distribution plant and through BNP for DM8,899,980. They were the fourth instalment (10%) payable under the contract with Siemen. 
 
(10) Match 9: The documentary evidence confirmed that BNP paid Siemens for the account of Pertamina the sums of DM44,916,940 and DM12,453,430 in May 1974. They were the first down payments for both the contract materials and contract services and their total threw up Match 9 in relation to the DM ACU deposits. 
 
(11) Match 10: They were two sets of the second down payments for the contract materials and contract services under the contract bearing reference No 84/KONTR/PD-FRAST/74 dated 4 May 1974. First National City Bank of Jakarta, Indonesia paid DM44,916,940 and DM12,453,430 in June 1974 for the account of Pertamina whose accounting records confirmed the payments. As noted earlier, Siemens also confirmed receipt of these sums by Statement B annexed to their letter of 12 June 1975. 
 
(12) Match 11: Pertamina had an airport project and a diesel electric power station in Batam Island, Indonesia. In June 1973 they paid Siemens DM1,565,950 and DM734,183 through the Continental Bank International, New York, USA. The total of these sums threw up a 10% payment by Siemens to General Thahir.
  
 
 
In the circumstances, my finding is that Pertamina by the oral evidence of Mr Nur Usman and the other officers whom I have named have proved their payments to Siemens and Klockner which are set out in Annexure B. Further the evidence of Mr Balasubramaniam and Mr Muthu Palaniappan have also proved Pertamina`s payments through BNP. In the course of the trial I had also allowed and admitted evidence pursuant to s 32 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). These evidence independently satisfied me that Pertamina had made payments to Siemens and Klockner as they allege and as set out in Annexure B.
I now refer to another source of evidence led by Pertamina to prove their payments to Siemens and Klockner. They led the evidence of Mr Ronald Grund, a certified accountant, who worked between June 1965 and May 1985 in the audit department of Arthur Young & Co, the accountants of Pertamina. For the period from 1978 to 1984 he was a full-time consultant to the Finance Directorate of Pertamina, stationed in Jakarta. In late 1979 he joined Pertamina`s litigation team to recover the ACU deposits of General Thahir. He was given the task of establishing, if he could, the relationship between Pertamina`s payments to their contractors and General Thahir`s ACU deposits. He found that the accounting records within Pertamina were disorganized. But he said he successfully collated a bundle of documents which evidenced each payment by Pertamina to Siemens and Klockner. He kept the documents in his files which in turn were kept in boxes. He locked up those boxes in his cabinet in Pertamina`s office. In respect of documents outside Pertamina, he visited most of the banks in person to obtain information regarding Pertamina`s payments through those banks. Initially his visits did not turn up anything as the banks were unhelpful. After he had collated specific internal information based on documents on each payment, he renewed his requests to the banks. He obtained the verification from BNP: see exh E6(I)/27 and 29 by which BNP furnished details of the telegraphic transfers to Siemens. In E6(I)/27 Mr Grund had written a set of figures which related to Match 2 payments. His evidence was to the effect that he had seen accounting and documentary documents which proved Pertamina`s payments to Siemens and Klockner. In his cross-examination, Mr Eder questioned the admissibility of Mr Grund`s evidence on the basis that his entire evidence was hearsay. Mr Grund firmly disagreed. He said he carried out his checks on a very exacting standard which was very much higher than that applied in an ordinary audit. He said: `I can state as a matter of fact that these payments have been made on the dates indicated`. There, he was referring to exh I of his report in bundle F to Pertamina. That exhibit was dated 28 April 1980.
It was Mr Grund who first discovered the linkages between Pertamina`s payments and General Thahir`s ACU deposits. By a sophisticated computerized programme, he was able to pair off Pertamina`s payments and the ACU deposits. The percentages of 13% for the Klockner matches, 5% for the Siemens matches, and the 10% for match 11 were established by his investigative efforts. His entire methodology and the validity of his findings were confirmed by a piece of evidence which emerged in the early stages of this trial. I refer to the lack of any documentary evidence bearing on Pertamina`s payments so far as the 10% Match 11 is concerned. As has been noted earlier, documents which emerged from discovery during the trial confirmed that Pertamina had paid Siemens for the power station and the airport projects in Batam Island, Indonesia. Having reviewed his evidence, I was satisfied that his evidence proved two important issues of fact in this case. First, his evidence as a whole proved that Pertamina had paid Siemens and Klockner the sums set out in Annexure B. Secondly, his evidence also proved the linkages between Pertamina`s payments and General Thahir`s DM ACU deposits.
Mr Grund had enlisted the expertise of Dr Sutaip Saw Leng Chooi, a holder of a PhD in statistics. Dr Sutaip Saw opined in his report, exh F(B), that `(o)n the basis of our probabilistic analysis and the available data, we conclude that 
 there exists a relationship between deposits in Mr Haji Thahir`s account in the Sumitomo Bank of Singapore and payments to certain German contractors involved in the Krakatau steel project 
 `. He explained the statistical bases. He stated that in General Thahir`s Sumitomo account, there are three occurrences of an exact 5% relationship and two occurrences of an exact 13% relationship between a DM deposit in General Thahir`s account and a payment to one of the German contractors involved in the steel project. He concluded in the following terms: ` 
 The likelihood of observing such an event corresponds to approximately one in five hundred thousand chance if there is no relationship between deposits and payments 
 .` Dr Sutaip Saw wrote a full report on his methodology and his report contains a large amount of statistical formulae, which this court confesses it is unable to comprehend in any meaningful measure. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, and on the basis of whatever is plainly comprehensible in the report, it seems to me very likely than not that Dr Sutaip Saw`s opinion may be safely accepted.
In view of the overwhelming evidence, I find that in truth and in fact all 17 ACU deposits denominated in Deutschmarks were bribes which Siemens and Klockner had paid General Thahir. I would summarize my reasons as follows. I rely on the admissions of Mrs Kartika Thahir which she made to General Moerdani. Secondly, there is no evidence that General Thahir or Mrs Kartika Thahir had any fortune anywhere near the sums we are looking at. General Thahir`s tax returns do not begin to explain any legitimate source or sources of the ACU DM deposits. Thirdly, the 
 eleven 
 matched deposits, their percentages in relation to Pertamina`s payments and the dates of their initial deposits in most part following such payments are all tell-tale indications of bribes. Fourthly, I refer to General Thahir`s and Mrs Kartika Thahir`s misrepresentations to Mr Hotta and Mr Yamaura of Sumitomo Bank. I am convinced that General Thahir had struck his dishonest deals with the German contractors and to the knowledge of Mrs Kartika Thahir, they were making banking arrangements to deposit the bribes in a shroud of secrecy. Fifthly, I turn to the six 
 unmatched 
 deposits in Deutschmarks. I place great reliance on Mrs Kartika Thahir`s admissions. She confessed to General Moerdani that the DM50m in the bank came from Siemens as to DM15m and Klockner as to DM35m. Quite apart from her admissions, and some of the foregoing reasons, it is not unlikely in this case, as Mr Grund had explained, that there could be a number of reasons why these six deposits were unmatched.
I now turn to the two ACU deposits denominated in US dollars. By 23 July 1976 they had accumulated substantial interest and, as listed in items 18 and 19 in Annexure A, they had grown to US$593,249.31 and US$608,959.42. In fact, the two deposits were placed two or three years earlier. On 11 December 1973 General Thahir deposited with the bank ACU US$484,000 and on 27 March 1974 he deposited ACU US$500,000. Mr Hunt invites this court to infer that these two US dollar deposits were also proceeds of bribes. I decline to do so. Rather different considerations apply so far as these two deposits are concerned. Pertamina in my view have not led any evidence to discharge their legal and evidential burden of proof. Mrs Kartika Thahir`s admissions did not refer to these US dollar deposits. The US dollar deposits which she mentioned to General Moerdani were those placed with the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Hong Kong Bank and which she said were for her daily expenses. I bear in mind that each of the two US dollar deposits were separate and discrete and to taint them as bribes simply because they were placed in the same bank seems to me to be unwarranted. I have considered the long career of General Thahir and the fact that he had been in private business for a number of years. He was in the import and export business which dealt with commodities such as rubber and coffee. He also had financial interest in a shipping company. I am not prepared to infer that he could not have accumulated some fortune which would enable him to place the two US dollar deposits. I realize that his tax returns were modest; but inasmuch as they relate to his income and not his capital assets of every description, I cannot draw any unfavourable inference against him on the basis of those tax returns. Although there was strictly no evidence of General Thahir`s immovable properties in Indonesia, it has to be said that the averments of the estate of General Thahir in relation to his immovable properties in Jakarta and Palembang have not been controverted by Pertamina who could have done so if these averments were untrue. Accordingly, Pertamina have no claim on these two US dollar deposits.
(e) Role of Mrs Kartika Thahir According to her, she married General Thahir on 29 July 1974 but, as she had asserted in the Japanese proceedings, she had lived with him as man and wife for a period of about five years prior to the marriage. Pertamina are not concerned with the question of the validity of her marriage.
As she herself had revealed in the Japanese proceedings, sometime in August 1972 she and General Thahir had in Singapore met Mr Hotta, the chairman of Sumitomo Bank. Both of them discussed with Mr Hotta the opening of a joint account in the Singapore branch of that bank. She had emphasized to Mr Hotta that the deposits should be kept a secret and that each of them should retain the right of withdrawal without the consent of the other. She and General Thahir again met Mr Hotta in Tokyo, Japan in early 1974 and the subject of the deposit account was again discussed. By then, as the evidence established, General Thahir had made a number of deposits.
By her affidavit affirmed on 2 March 1977 and filed in these proceedings, she affirmed by para 3 thereof that `(i)n the early part of 1974, my husband and I were 
 introduced 
 to a Mr Shozo Hotta, the then chairman of [Sumitomo Bank], in Tokyo. She confirmed that General Thahir had a number of meetings with
Mr Hotta, at most of which she was present. In the following paragraph she claimed that in consequence of those meetings, and at Mr Hotta`s suggestion, General Thahir and she decided to open the joint account in the Singapore branch. As Mr Hunt points out, this part of her affidavit evidence is misleading in two respects. First, it suppressed the fact that they had met Mr Hotta as early as August 1972. Secondly, it does not sit well with the fact that General Thahir had placed some ACU deposits with the Singapore branch. I am satisfied that she had suppressed the fact of the August 1972 meeting and the fact that ACU deposits had been placed before early August 1974 because those facts would provide some incriminating basis for the assertion that before the first ACU deposit was placed, General Thahir and she, as she must have known, had struck their dishonest arrangements with Siemens and Klockner.
Her affidavit affirmed on 1 February 1980 is even more telling. She affirmed that she knew that General Thahir had received the ACU deposits, that General Sutowo as the president director of Pertamina had personal knowledge of General Thahir`s receipts of the moneys and that there was no suggestion from General Sutowo that any of the moneys belonged to Pertamina. She also disclosed that in 1976 General Thahir and she had planned to use some of the ACU deposits to attempt to purchase the Hyatt Hotel, Singapore and that the couple had a disagreement over this proposal.
Following the death of General Thahir, she withdrew moneys from the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Hong Kong Bank. She has not volunteered any information about those withdrawals.
In late 1976 or early 1977 Mrs Kartika Thahir met with Mr Ibrahim Thahir to discuss ways and means to collect from the German contractors moneys which were allegedly due and payable to General Thahir. To that end, in August 1977 she obtained a power of attorney from Mr Ibrahim Thahir acting for himself and the estate of General Thahir to authorize her to recover moneys allegedly owed to General Thahir by Siemens. An agreement in writing dated 29 August 1977 was entered into in Basel, Switzerland, between Mrs Kartika Thahir and Mr Ibrahim Thahir (who acted for General Thahir`s estate). By that agreement, both parties agreed that `all claims against Siemens roughly in the amount of DM15m were to be divided between the parties`.
Since she has elected not to give evidence on her own behalf, which she is perfectly entitled, she has not offered to this court any contrary evidence or explanations on those evidence which tell against her.
I would finally refer to the evidence of her admissions to General Moerdani. I need not repeat the evidence nor my findings which have been fully set out earlier in this judgment.
In the light of the evidence set out above, I am more than satisfied and almost sure (from the evidential point of view) that she was hand in glove with General Thahir in his dishonest schemes to receive the bribes and that she participated in and/or was privy to the receipt by General Thahir of the bribes which funded the 17 ACU deposits denominated in Deutschmarks. 
 Conflict of laws 
(a) Choice of law: Singapore law
Pertamina say first and foremost that the governing law in this case should be exclusively Singapore law, and that Indonesian law is irrelevant to any issue.
Reference was initially made to r 203, sub-r 1 of II 
 Dicey and Morris 
 (11th Ed), which gives guidance on the applicable law in a restitutional or quasi-contractual situation, that is, ascertaining the proper law of the obligation.
As to the determination of the proper law of the obligation, sub-r 2 is reproduced below: 
 
 
(a) if the obligation arises in connection with a contract, its proper law is the proper law of the contract; 
 
(b) if it arises in connection with a transaction concerning an immovable(land), its proper law is the law of the country where the immovable is situated (lex situs); 
 
(c) if it arises in any other circumstances, its proper law is the law of the country where the enrichment occurs.
  
 
 
Mr Hunt, for the plaintiffs, submits that it is sub-r 2(c) that applies in this case. Singapore law should apply as the lex causae, for Singapore is the place of ultimate enrichment. In 
Re Jogia (a bankrupt)
 
[1988] 1 WLR 484
[1988] 2 All ER 328
 it was held that in an action for money had and received, the proper law of the obligation will be the law of the place of receipt, since that is the place where the enrichment occurs. See also 
Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd
 
[1981] Ch 105
[1979] 3 All ER 1025
[1980] 2 WLR 202
Mr Eder, for Mrs Kartika Thahir, contends that Indonesian law is by no means irrelevant. He says that for the plaintiffs to succeed, they must establish a proprietary claim against the ACU deposits as a matter of Indonesian and Singapore law. Attention was drawn to the contract of employment between Thahir and the plaintiffs, and how Thahir acted in breach of his duty to the plaintiffs in his capacity as an employee. Since this was a breach of an implied obligation (not to take bribes) arising in connection with a contract, sub-r 2(a) should apply, and one should look towards the proper law of the contract, which in this case would be Indonesian law. For determining the proper law of the contract, see 
 Augustus v Permanent Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd 
 6 at p 252.
It is argued on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir that sub-r 2(c) only applies in `any other circumstances`, that is, situations not arising under (a) or (b). It has no application where the obligation arises in connection with a contract. The case of 
 Re Jogia 
 4 was cited in 
 Dicey and Morris 
 as a footnote to sub-r 2(c). Mr Eder also argues that in that case there was no prior contract existing between the parties. Similarly with 
 Chase Manhattan Bank 
 ,5 which dealt with money being erroneously credited and the benefit arose without any prior contract. It was also a sub-r 2(c) case.
The submission of Mr Eder is that where a bribe is accepted `in connection with a contract`, sub-r 2(a) must necessarily apply, and where a bribe is accepted without any prior contract, sub-r 2(c) would apply. The case of 
 Mahesan s/o Thambiah v Malaysia Government Officers` Co-operative Housing Society 
 7 was also cited, in which Lord Diplock suggested that a bribe may be recovered by a principal from his agent. At p 380E, his Lordship contemplated additional remedies that were available in circumstances where bribes were given in `connection with a contract`. And it was further said, that where it was given in connection with the contract between the principal and the briber, the principal was entitled to rescission of the contract. Mr Eder argues that this is in the language of sub-r 2(a).
I shall now set out what in my view is a proper reading of r 203 of 
 Dicey and Morris 
 . Whilst the obligation to restore an unjust benefit may or may not arise in connection with a contract, the receipt of bribes, in all circumstances, will always fall under sub-r 2(c). The primary concern of parties in such a case is always to obtain recovery of moneys in the place of receipt or the place of enrichment. Its law should logically be the proper law of the obligation. I am aware that the 
 Dicey and Morris 
 explanation of sub-r 2(c) of the rule refers to the situation where benefit is conferred upon another person with whom no prior contract exists. In the authors` contemplations were circumstances where moneys were wrongly credited due to a mistake of fact; eg 
 Chase Manhattan 
 .5
Further, Lord Diplock`s remarks in 
 Mahesan 
 ,7 where he mentioned the giving of a bribe in connection with a contract, should be seen in the context of a principal`s alternative remedy of rescission of his contract with the briber. His Lordship was not dealing with r 203 in 
 Dicey and Morris 
 .
In relation to obligations that arise in connection with a contract under sub-r 2(a), the explanation in 
 Dicey and Morris 
 , is in my view thorough. Here we are contemplating situations where one is seeking to recover money that is paid pursuant to an ineffective contract, or an illegal contract, to quote a few examples. It is notable that the authors did not contemplate the giving of bribes in connection with a contract.
A bribe is a bribe, and the lex causae in such a case must be the law of the place where enrichment takes place, within sub-r 2(c) of r 203 of 
 Dicey and Morris 
 . In applying this test, the lex causae in the present case would be Singapore law.
Pertamina`s claim at common law. This is a cause of action in money had and received. It is a principal`s main cause of action against a bribed agent. Mr Hunt makes the correct observation that whilst the relationship between principal and agent is one always founded on contract, the obligation to restore the bribe as money had and received to the principal`s use does not arise in connection with the contract in the sense of sub-r 2(a) cited above.
Applying the above interpretation of r 203 of 
 Dicey and Morris 
 , an action for money had and received is a cause of action that falls under sub-r 2(c). A number of authorities were cited on behalf of Pertamina.
The case of 
 Bowling v Cox 
 .8 This case concerned the grant of leave to serve proceedings out of jurisdiction, based on the construction of s 29 of Ch X of the Consolidated Laws of British Honduras. A trustee was making a claim against an estate for interest that was due to creditors. It was alleged that the estate had earned interest from some assets in British Honduras, which the executor remitted to the United States of America.
It was held that the executor was a trustee, justifying service out of the jurisdiction. Part of the ratio is that the receipt of the moneys by an attorney on behalf of the executor took place in British Honduras, where he obtained the money. The court held that the action for money had and received arose out of and by reason of the fact that the money had been got in by the respondent through his attorney in British Honduras (at p 754). The place of receipt was in British Honduras. It was there that the cause of action arose. Mr Eder points out that the claim by the trustee in bankruptcy did not arise in connection with any prior contract. Based on the above analysis, in the case of bribes, where the recovery at common law is an action in money had and received, the matter is dealt with under sub-r 2(c). In the case of bribes, therefore, the not unimportant consideration of whether there was a prior contract is immaterial.
Further, it is also submitted by Mr Eder that as a matter of the conflict of laws, 
 Bowling v Cox 
 8 did not state any general proposition that all claims for the recovery of moneys are to be determined by reference to the law of the place of receipt of the moneys in question. I am aware that the case deals with issues of jurisdiction, and as such has no direct bearing on choice of law. The case is, however, of assistance in determining where the cause of action for money had and received arises.
The case of 
 Rousou`s (a bankrupt) Trustee v Rousou 
 .9 Both Mr Hunt and Mr Eder are in agreement that this is a case of doubtful authority. It concerned the claim of a trustee in bankruptcy to recover from the defendants moneys formerly the property of the bankrupt, that were received in Cyprus. Order 11 service was granted on the basis that it was a right that was quasi-contractual in nature. The decision of 
 Bowling v Cox 
 8 was arguably misapplied; since the money was received in Cyprus, the cause of action for money had and received arose there. Writ service under O 11 should have been denied.
The case of 
 Re Jogia 
 .4 Another O 11 case, involving a trustee in bankruptcy who claimed against a French company for having exceeded the commission that was chargeable over the purchase of gold bullion by a bankrupt. On the application of the defendants, O 11 service was set aside because firstly, the bankrupt had agreed to pay the company`s reasonable charges, and the court found that the French company had made a reasonable financing charge. Secondly, there was a choice of jurisdiction clause favouring the commercial court of Paris.
More importantly, Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson VC took the view that the cause of action, in the case of a quasi-contractual obligation, arose in the place of receipt. He says at p 495H: 
 
As at present advised, I am of the view that quasi-contractual obligations of this kind arise from the receipt of the money. I find it difficult to see how such obligation can be said to be made or arise in any place other than that of the receipt. As to the proper law, 
 Dicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws
 (10th Ed, 1980) Vol 2 p 921 r 170 expresses the view that, save in cases where the obligation to repay arises in connection with a contract or an immoveable, the proper law of the quasi-contract is the law of the country where the enrichment occurs. This accords with the American Restatement and seems to me to be sound in principle.
 
 
 
In this passage is contained strong support for the 
 Dicey and Morris 
 analysis, and that an action for money had and received is governed by sub-r 2(c). It also does not contradict the wider application of sub-r 2(c) to bribes in general.
Referring to the passage quoted above, Mr Eder submits that the cause of action that arises in the place of receipt of the money is only limited to the context of the payment of money by mistake to a third party. This argument is not sustainable, as in 
 Re Jogia 
 ,4 payment was deliberate.
Further, Mr Eder observes that the judge implicitly approved his perceived distinction drawn in 
 Dicey and Morris 
 , r 203, between sub-r 2(a) and sub-r 2(c). He argues that there was no prior contract between the bankrupt and the French company, and therefore the case fell properly under sub-r 2(c). On his analysis if there was a contract, it would fall under sub-r 2(a) and the lex causae would have been the proper law of the contract.
In his reply, Mr Hunt refers to p 488G, where it was said that the outlined scheme in question was agreed between the company and the bankrupt, and that there was no direct contract between the bankrupt and the company, since the bankrupt`s agreement to the terms proposed was communicated to one Penalia. However at p 490F, it emerged that Penalia was an agent for the bankrupt, and in that capacity paid the French company. Two observations should be made. First, the bankrupt was in an indirect contractual relationship with the French company through the agency of Penalia. Secondly, a contractual relationship of this character would similarly exist between the French company and the trustee in bankruptcy.
In my view the contractual relationship that was discovered in 
 Re Jogia 
 4 further illustrates the discrepancy inherently present in the distinction between sub-r 2(a) and sub-r 2(c), of the kind advanced by Mr Eder. It is the cause of action for money had and received that puts the case under the 2(c) category, even if a contractual relationship is present.
Conclusion: It does appear from the authorities cited that at common law the cause of action for money had and received arises in the place of receipt. When the money was deposited by General Thahir in Singapore, that is where the action for money had and received arose.
Considering the lex causae, in so far as the claim is based on the substantive law of money had and received, the matter is wholly governed by Singapore. This is quite clear from the application of r 203(2)(c) of 
 Dicey and Morris 
 , and in particular the leading case of 
 Re Jogia 
 .4
Pertamina`s claim in equity: Under this heading a number of authorities was cited to the court, with the view to establish Singapore law as the applicable law in the claim to trace funds in a Singapore bank account, or the imposition of a constructive trust, the foundation of which is an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by General Thahir. They are considered below.
The case of 
 Lord Cranstown v Johnston 
 .10 This was an action brought in England concerning an interest in land in the West Indies in circumstances where the defendant had obtained judgment in a foreign jurisdiction, that is the courts of St Christopher, and had done so validly in accordance with the local laws and an English arbitration award that was executed there. The defendant subsequently purchased the interest in those lands at a very low price.
The court affirmed that it cannot act upon land directly, but acts upon the conscience of the person living there. In these circumstances the court could not permit the defendant to obtain an unfair advantage through the laws of St Christopher`s and the execution of the English arbitration award in that jurisdiction (see p 959 per Arden MR).
Mr Eder says that the case establishes a general but limited proposition that ` ... with regard to any contract made or equity between persons in this country respecting lands in a foreign country ...` the court will hold the same jurisdiction as if the lands were situated in England. The case does not go further than that.
Mr Hunt, on the other hand, contends that the case establishes the more general principles that: first, equity acts in personam, and secondly, courts of equity apply their own rules. Applying the latter proposition to the present case, it means that a Singapore court will apply the lex fori when exercising its equitable jurisdiction.
Mr Eder strongly submits at the very outset that such a view is untenable. There is no authority for any such proposition in any textbook. It is also unmentioned in 
 Dicey and Morris 
 ; for if it is the law, then a proviso would have been entered by the authors just below r 203. Mr Eder is also of the view that the general proposition meant that one completely ignores any foreign law when dealing with equitable claims, and this was a negative point.
Clearly the case was not concerned with conflict of laws as such, but with the jurisdiction of the court of equity to act.
The case of 
 Deschamps v Miller 
 .11 This was another jurisdiction case, where the general principle was stated by Parker J that an English court will not adjudicate on questions relating to the title or the right to the possession of immovable property situated out of the jurisdiction of that court. The exceptions to this principle merit consideration. At p 863 his Lordship did not give an exhaustive list, but in essence concluded that they all depend on some personal obligation arising out of contract, implied contract, fiduciary relationship, or other conduct which, in the view of the court of equity, is unconscionable.
Mr Hunt submits that based on the above, Singapore courts apply their own concepts of what amounts or does not amount to unconscionable conduct or a fiduciary relationship, a breach thereof or fraud, in deciding whether it can exercise its equitable jurisdiction.
Mr Eder considers the 
 Deschamps 
 decision11 to be irrelevant, since it is not concerned with the conflict of laws.
The case of 
 British South Africa Co v De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd 
 .12 To my mind, a most important case, and it concerns the `clogs doctrine` - the equitable rule against clogging the redemption of a mortgage with regard to an English contract for the issue of debentures. In this case the equitable rule was enforced against a contracting party in the jurisdiction even though the floating security that was created comprised land in a foreign jurisdiction in which the `clogs` doctrine was not recognized.
The ratio of the 
 Cranstown 
 decision10 was given strong endorsement by Cozens-Hardy MR at p 513: 
 
For centuries the Court of Chancery has, by virtue of its jurisdiction in personam, applied against parties to a contract or trust relating to foreign land the principles of English law, although the lex situs did not recognize such principles. The judgment of Lord Alvanley in 
 Lord Cranstown v Johnston
 3 Ves 170 at p 182 asserts this in very strong language: `With regard to any contract made or equity between persons in this country respecting lands in a foreign country, particularly in the British Dominions, this court will hold the same jurisdiction as if they were situated in England.`
 
 
 
Mr Hunt refers to the case as being strong support for the principle in 
 Cranstown 
 .10 A court of equity applies its own rules. It is also submitted that in the present case, the Singapore court is in a position to exercise its jurisdiction in rem, because this is where the money is situated.
Mr Eder seeks to distinguish this case from the instant case on the basis that it dealt solely with the jurisdiction of the English courts to act in personam in respect of an English law contract; in circumstances where the contract was governed by English law, or in administering equities between parties already resident in England. See p 518, per Farwell LJ; p 520, per Kennedy LJ.
It is to be observed that the above cases have thus far dealt only with the jurisdiction of a court of equity to act in personam. To this extent, I find myself in agreement with Mr Eder. These authorities have no bearing on deciding whether an equity exists in the first place, and furthermore which law should govern.
The case of 
 Re Anchor Line (Henderson Brothers) Ltd 
 .13 This was the case where a liquidator took out an originating summons to determine whether a valid and effectual charge had been created over the moveable property of a company which was situated, at the commencement of liquidation, in Scotland. It was held, inter alia, that in considering the validity of the charge, English law should be applied, following the 
 De Beers 
 decision.12
Noteworthy is the extension of principle to moveable property. Luxmoore J said at p 488: 
 
... and in determining whether there is an equity the court regards English, not foreign law, and if according to English law there is an equity, eg if for valuable consideration a company agrees to give a charge on foreign property, the court will enforce it, although the equity may be one not recognized by the lex loci rei sitae.
 
 
 
Courts of equity will apply their own rules to determining whether there is an equity. In the present case, it would be a matter for Singapore law whether there is an equity or not.
Mr Eder contends that the reference at p 488 was based on a misreading of the case, stating that English rules were applied because English law was the lex causae governing the floating charge. It is further argued that the same principle would not apply to a claim arising in connection with a contract which was itself governed by foreign law, as in the present case.
I think that this is not the case. The `court will enforce it, although the equity may be one not recognized by the lex loci rei sitae`. I believe that the same principle will apply even with a foreign lex causae. See 
 National Commercial Bank v Wimborne 
 .14
It is observed that many English cases would have English law as the lex causae. One cannot ignore the realistic possibility of proceedings commenced abroad, or stays of action, in the case of a foreign lex causae. In the case of the latter, there is the forum non conveniens doctrine. One of the factors determining an appropriate forum abroad so as to justify a stay is the applicable law: see 
 Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd 
 15 and 
 De Dampierre v De Dampierre 
 .16 (There are generally more stays granted after the 
 Spiliada 
 decision,15 since Lord Goff downgraded the importance of advantages accruing to the plaintiff from having trial in England.)
The case of 
 National Commercial Bank v Wimborne 
 .14 This was a claim for interlocutory relief restraining the defendants from removing assets from Australia and from disposing certain assets which could be traced to certain loan funds which were held on trust.
It was argued by the defendants that Swiss law, being the lex causae, precluded the relief sought. The plaintiffs could not be entitled to claim such remedies in New South Wales. Holland J, sitting in the Supreme Court of New South Wales (equity division) took the following view: 
 
... the plaintiffs are claiming equitable rights and equitable remedies. The equity court has long taken the view that because it is a court of conscience and acts in personam, it has jurisdiction over persons within and subject to its jurisdiction to require them to act in accordance with the principles of equity administered by the court wherever the subject matter and whether or not it is possible for the court to make orders in rem in the particular matter. In short, if the defendant is here, the equities arising from a transaction to which he is a party as ascertained by New South Wales law and the equitable remedies provided by that law will be applied to him.
 
 
 
Thus it was said that the equity court determines according to the lex fori whether an equity exists, its nature and the remedy available. His Lordship cited the above cases in support. A fortiori if the property sought after is also within the jurisdiction of the court.
Mr Eder`s comment on earlier cases that English rules were applicable only because it was assumed that English law was the applicable law runs counter to the proposition set out in this case. The lex causae in this case was foreign, ie Swiss law, yet the court still applied NSW rules. This is one instance where the assumption that the contract arose in English law broke down.
Mr Eder also submits that the judgment and views expressed in the case were not final, and that the court was only concerned with justifying the grant of interlocutory relief. I am unable to accept these arguments. It appears to me that Holland J`s remarks were definitely more than tentative, and having to prove a sufficiently arguable case necessarily meant going into the substance of trial. 
 United States Surgical Corporation v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd 
 17 is another NSW decision. It was a case where the plaintiffs made a claim for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, contractual obligations and conspiracy following the defendant`s termination of a distributorship agreement in relation to surgical stapling instruments and disposable loading units.
The court upheld, inter alia, what has become the cardinal principle that (at p 798C): 
 
Where a defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court, the court may grant equitable relief in accordance with equitable principles as administered in the forum provided that the defendant while resident in the forum was guilty of conduct which, by offending against those principles, gave rise to the occasion for such regulation.
 
 
 
Equitable relief was thus administered according to the lex fori.
Mr Shanmugam for Mrs Kartika Thahir argues that the views expressed above were obiter, since the judge reached the conclusion that there was no material difference between the various systems of law, and that the views are all tentative. In my opinion the passage quoted above is part of the ratio of the case, and is consistent with the 
 Wimborne 
 decision.14
Mr Shanmugam also makes reference to the passage at p 798C as being concerned with whether the particular defendant can be said to have been guilty of such conduct while `resident within the forum`. I think it can safely be said that the mention of `residency` goes to jurisdiction, even then it is not necessary if the court is otherwise able to exercise jurisdiction over him. I do not think that 798C gives rise to any `test` of the kind advanced by Mr Shanmugam. It would seem sufficient that the defendant while resident within the forum is guilty of conduct which by offending the principles of equity administered by that forum gives rise to `the occasion for such regulation`.
Conclusion: From the authorities cited under this heading I am of the view that the forum will apply its own rules in deciding whether it has equitable jurisdiction: 
 Deschamps 
 11 and 
 De Beers 
 .12
Considering the lex causae: the forum will similarly apply its own law to determine the kind of equitable obligations that arise from the unconscionability of the defendant`s acts: 
 Wimborne 
 14 and 
 US Surgical 
 ;17 even in the case of moveable property: 
 Re Anchor 
 .13
It follows that as with the position at common law, Singapore law will necessarily govern. It is only logical that one should look at both the claims at common law and in equity by reference to the same system of law.
(b) Choice of law: the combination of Singapore and Indonesian laws.
The lex fori will govern remedies: 
Chase Manhattan
 
[1981] Ch 105
[1979] 3 All ER 1025
[1980] 2 WLR 202
 As to the law governing the substantive obligations, there are realistically two possibilities according to
Mr Hunt: 
 
 
(1) Indonesian law governs every other substantive issue; eg was Thahir`s conduct unlawful, whether he was a fiduciary, whether the bribes belonged to the plaintiff, etc. 
 
(2) Indonesian law only considers the question of whether Thahir`s activities were unlawful. On this analysis, questions of whether Thahir was a fiduciary and whether bribes are to be regarded as belonging to Pertamina - will be decided by Singapore law. It was said by Goulding J in 
Chase Manhattan
 
[1981] Ch 105
[1979] 3 All ER 1025
[1980] 2 WLR 202
 that the question of whether the individual is to be regarded as a fiduciary, or whether the property is to belong to the plaintiff, is inexorably connected to the existence of the remedy.
  
 
 
If necessary, I am of the view that in any combined application of the two systems of law to resolve the disputes in these proceedings, the combination as set out under item (2) is more justified.
(c)Choice of law: lex fori may apply in the absence of a conflict
This alternative is feasible if General Thahir is found to be a mandatory under Indonesian law. If there is no material difference between Singapore law and Indonesian law, there is no conflict to be resolved: see 
Chase Manhattan
 
[1981] Ch 105
[1979] 3 All ER 1025
[1980] 2 WLR 202
 at p 120A per Goulding J; 
 US Surgical v Hospital 
 17 at p 798B-G per McClelland J. In 
 US Surgical 
 17 it was held, inter alia, that the law of New South Wales (lex fori) should be applied in determining what relief was available except to the extent that a material difference was proved to exist between the relevant laws of NSW, New York and Connecticut.
What amounts to a `material difference` between two systems of law? Reference is again made to McClelland J`s judgment in 
 US Surgical v Hospital 
 ,17 at pp 798G-799B: 
 
... having heard a considerable amount of evidence from highly qualified witnesses as to the New York/Connecticut relating to fiduciary relationships and duties and the consequences of breaches of such duties, or at least as to so much of the law as might apply to the facts disclosed in the present proceedings. I have formed the view that there is no material difference between the law of those places and that of New South Wales on those subjects relevant to those facts. In both systems the development of the fiduciary concept has proceeded by equitable principles derived from the law of England ...
 
 
 
In the present case, under Indonesian law the concepts of a trust or fiduciary are non-existent. For that reason, I am of the view that this forms a sufficient material difference for a conflict to arise.
 Recovery under Singapore law
(a) Money had and received
Although bribery as a civil wrong must have existed, it is a little surprising that there has been no case before the Judicature Act 1875 reporting a successful claim at law for the recovery of a bribe by a principal from his agent. Equity as will be seen in the next section had imposed a constructive trust on the bribed agent: see 
Fawcett v Whitehouse
 
[1829] 1 Russ & M 132
[] 39 ER 51
 It must have been recognized, as it was later in the following case, that the law must forbid the bribery of agents because the effect of a bribe is to put the agent in a position in which his interest conflicts with his duty.
By 1888, Bowen LJ in 
 Boston Deep Sea Fishing & Ice Co v Ansell 
 19 at p 367 ruled that a bribe is recoverable at common law as money had and received by the agent to the use of his principal: 
 
... the law implies a use, that is to say, there is an implied contract, if you put it as a legal proposition - there is an equitable right, if you treat it as a matter of equity - as between the principal and agent that the agent should pay it over, which renders the agent liable to be sued for money had and received, ... and to take it out of the hands of the agent, which gives the principal a right to relief in equity.
 
 
 
Slade J in 
 Industries and General Mortgage Co Ltd v Lewis 
 20 usefully indicated what constitutes a bribe in civil law or in a non-criminal law context. He said at p 575F-H: 
 
For the purposes of the civil law a bribe means the payment of a secret commission, which only means (i) that the person making the payment makes it to the agent of the other person with whom he is dealing; (ii) that he makes it to that person knowing that that person is acting as the agent of the other person with whom he is dealing; and
 
 
 
(iii) that he fails to disclose to the other person with whom he is dealing that he has made that payment to the person whom he knows to be the other person`s person. Those three are the only elements necessary to constitute the payment of a secret commission or bribe for civil purposes.
 
 
 
Once the payment and receipt of a bribe is established, courts have applied certain rules. 
 
Among them the following are now established, and, in my opinion, rightly established, in the interests of morality with the view of discouraging the practice of bribery. First, the court will not inquire into the donor`s motive in giving the bribe, nor allow evidence to be gone into as to motive. Secondly, the court will presume in favour of the principal and as against the briber and the agent bribed, that the agent was influenced by the bribe; and this presumption is irrebuttable. Thirdly, if the agent be a confidential buyer of goods for his principal from the briber, the court will assume as against the briber that the true price of the goods as between him and the purchaser must be taken to be less than the price paid to, or charged by, the vendor by, at any rate, the amount or value of the bribe. [See Romer LJ in 
Hovenden & Sons v Millhoff
 
[1900] 83 LT 41
[1900-3] All ER Rep 848
 at p 43.]
 
 
 
Regarding remedies, it has been authoritatively laid down in 
 Mahesan v Malaysia Housing Society 
 7 at p 383G-H per Lord Diplock that: 
 
... the principal has these alternative remedies: (1) for money had and received under which he can recover the amount of the bribe as money had and received or, (2) for damages for fraud, under which he can recover the amount of the actual loss sustained in consequence of his entering into the transaction in respect of which the bribe was given, but he cannot recover both.
 
 
 
The common law action will arise whenever the agent has been enriched by his own wrongdoing at the expense of his principal. The giving or taking of the bribe is the wrongful conduct which founds the action. The bribee`s enrichment is at the expense of the principal, in the sense that the bribe was obtained by virtue of his position as agent, servant or partner of the principal. Damage is not the gist of the action; it therefore matters not whether the principal has suffered any loss, or that the principal could not have obtained for himself the money which the defendant received: see 
 Reading v The King 
 .22
In proceedings against the bribed agent, the principal is entitled to recover from him the amount of the bribe. That was decided in 
 Mahesan v Malaysia Housing Society 
 .7 The society`s agent found a piece of land in Penang which was suitable for the purposes of the Society. He conspired with Manickam who bought the land for $456,000 and resold it to the Society for $944,000. The agent, unknown to the Society, received a bribe of $122,000, which was one-quarter of the gross profit which Manickam made. The Privy Council held that at common law a principal could recover from his bribed agent either the amount of the bribe as money had and received, or, alternatively, compensation for the actual loss sustained through entry into the transaction in respect of which the bribe was given as damages for fraud. We are concerned with the former cause of action and not the latter alternative cause of action based on fraud or, on one view, civil conspiracy.
In these proceedings, it is accepted on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir that a claim for money had and received lies against a bribee on the authority of 
 Mahesan v Malaysia Housing Society 
 ,7 notwithstanding that the bribe cannot be directly traced to the plaintiff or shown to be Pertamina`s money. That is the effect of 
 Mahesan 
 7 so far as concerns a principal`s claim against the bribed agent in an action for money had and received. In 
 Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson & Co 
 ,23 there was a claim for money had and received under a mistake of fact. It was decided that it could not be shown that the defendants had received the plaintiffs` money because of the mixing of the money in the New York clearing system and therefore the plaintiffs` claim for money had and received under a mistake failed: per Millet J at pp 282F-H, 285B-H and 289C-H. That point was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in 
 Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson & Co 
 ,24 per Fox LJ at pp 563C-566F. Mrs Kartika Thahir therefore accepts that the point which defeated the claim for money had and received under a mistake of fact in 
 Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson & Co 
 ,23 affirmed on that point by the Court of Appeal, did not stand in the way of Pertamina`s claim against General Thahir for recovery of the bribe.
Mr Eder also accepts that if a sum of money can be shown to be a plaintiff`s money which was received by the immediate recipient and then paid on to a volunteer, for eg a mistress, then a claim in money had and received will lie against the volunteer. He accepts the decision in 
 Banque Belge Pour L`Etranger 
 
 v Hambrouck & Ors 
 .25 H in that case by forged cheques induced the plaintiff bank to part with o6,000 of their money which another bank collected for and held to the credit of H in his account with that bank. No fund was paid into that account except the proceeds of the forged cheques. H was living with Mlle Spanoghe to whom he paid various sums of money out of the said bank account. Mlle Spanoghe paid the moneys into a deposit account which she kept with another bank. Again no other sum was paid into that deposit account. The balance, o315, was the subject of plaintiff bank`s claim. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff bank was entitled to recover it, taking the view that there could be tracing at common law.
However, Mr Eder says that Pertamina have no claim to the bribe unless they can show that where, as here, the bribe is paid to a volunteer, like Mrs Kartika Thahir, what was paid to Mrs Kartika Thahir was in fact Pertamina`s money. On the facts in this case, Pertamina will fail to show that the bribes were their money because the money paid by Pertamina to Siemens and Klockner must have lost its identity and was mixed in the general accounts of the two German contractors, just as Agip (Africa) Ltd`s money did when mingled in the New York clearing system. No authority has been cited to support Mr Eder`s contention. In principle it does not seem right to say that the cause of action for money had and received may or may not be available against a volunteer to whom the immediate recipient had paid the money. Further, as was pointed out by Millet J, at p 285E: `Money can be followed at common law into and out of a bank account and into the hands of a subsequent transferee, provided that it does not cease to be identifiable by being mixed with other money in the bank account derived from some other source.`
In my view, Pertamina have a right to recover the 17 ACU DM deposits as money had and received by her to their use. Secondly, by reason of her complicity in the entire corrupt bargain, she also participated in or was privy to the receipt by General Thahir of the bribes which funded the ACU DM deposits. Since Pertamina would have had a right to recover the 17 ACU DM deposits from General Thahir, they are so entitled to recover from the estate of General Thahir.
(b) Recovery in equity
(i) Constructive trusts generally. A court of law will declare that a person is a constructive trustee in respect of any property if his conduct is such as to warrant the imposition of a constructive trust. A court in considering whether to impose it will not take into consideration the intention of any of the parties. In contrast, an express trust or a resulting trust will arise dependent on the intention, express or implied, of a settlor. Thus, it is the conduct of the person who may be declared a constructive trustee by a court which is closely scrutinized and examined and that conduct is the common element in the usual cases where a constructive trust is ordered to arise by operation of law. Constructive trusts may be classified under several groups. But only for present purposes, it is convenient that constructive trusts may be grouped under three well-defined categories, viz (1) where a person has obtained an advantage by acting fraudulently or unconscionably or in certain situations inequitably; (2) where a fiduciary has obtained an advantage as a result of a breach of his duty of loyalty; and (3) where there has been a disposition of trust property in breach of trust: see AJ Oakley 
 Constructive Trusts 
 (2nd Ed) p 17.
Every kind of trust is a relationship in respect of property under which the trustee is obliged to deal with the property vested in him for the benefit of the beneficiary. It follows that when any property is declared to be the subject matter of a constructive trust, the imposition of the trust by that mere fact will give the beneficiary proprietary rights in the property. The property, in consequence, does not form part of the assets of the trustee in the case of the trustee`s insolvency. So long as the property exists and is not dissipated, the beneficiary may trace it at common law, where tracing is used as a tool of evidence to identify the beneficiary`s property, or in equity (which imposes a charge on it) to recover it. The proprietary right to trace and recover the trust property remains exercisable against a volunteer who has acquired legal ownership of the property. The beneficiary`s charge in equity over the trust property which arises under the constructive trust, however, ceases upon the vesting of the legal estate of the property on a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the trust.
To complete this prefatory part on the law of constructive trust, it should be pointed out that the imposition of a constructive trust gives rise to liabilities as against the constructive trustee both of a proprietary and of a personal nature. The former is an in rem remedy against the property over which the constructive trust is imposed. The latter is the personal liability of the constructive trustee to account to or compensate the beneficiary. These remedies may be pursued in the alternative or cumulatively, depending on the availability and identity of the property by tracing at law or in equity for recovery. If a proprietary remedy is no longer available or if the trust property is no longer identifiable by tracing at law or in equity, or if, for instance, it has been sold to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, the beneficiary is then left with a constructive trust action against the trustee to account and to pay compensation to him. This remedy in personam is, of course, worth the powder and shot only if the trustee is not insolvent. In rare cases, and in principle, a beneficiary under a constructive trust may exercise both his proprietary and personal remedy against the trustee where the facts and circumstances are such as to warrant it; for instance, where the property has been devalued by reason of the trustee`s breaches of duties. The distinction between the two types of remedies recently featured in the context of a mareva injunction application in 
 Polly Peck International plc v Nadir 
 .26
So far as the nature of remedy is concerned in this case, it is common ground between the parties that if the only remedy afforded by equity to Pertamina is a remedy in personam against General Thahir merely to account and that Pertamina do not have a proprietary remedy, as Mrs Kartika Thahir contends, Pertamina will fail in their claims in equity to the 17 ACU DM deposits. In that case, Pertamina`s claim at law for money had and received would be crucial as affording a route to recover the bribes.
In the instant case, the nature of the remedy we will be considering is whether a constructive trusteeship should be imposed on General Thahir under the second category and on Mrs Kartika Thahir under the first category.
Pertamina claim that they are entitled to recover in equity by making three principal submissions. They say, firstly, that the well-known case of 
 Lister & Co v Stubbs 
 27 is no bar to their right to recover the 17 ACU DM deposits because that case was wrongly decided or, at the very least, should not be followed in the present case. Secondly, Pertamina contend that they are entitled to assert a proprietary claim to the 17 ACU deposits without the need to establish that there was a fiduciary relationship between themselves and General Thahir. Thirdly, and in the alternative, they submit that if it is necessary that there should be a fiduciary relationship between themselves and General Thahir for them to be entitled to assert a proprietary claim to the 17 ACU DM deposits, then such a relationship existed. Mr Eder on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir challenges each of these broad submissions advanced on behalf of Pertamina. I shall now consider them in turn.
(ii) Is 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 wrong? Before I consider in detail the arguments and the principles enunciated in the extensive body of case law, perhaps I should set out in broad terms the respective submissions. Mr Hunt seeks to persuade me that 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 is, in the first place, inconsistent with previous authority: these are 
 Keech v Sandford 
 ;28 
 Fawcett v Whitehouse 
 ;18 
 Sugden v Crossland 
 29 and 
 Morison v Thompson 
 .30
In the second place, he contends that 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 is inconsistent with the `property` cases, viz: 
 Re Morvah Consols Tin Mining Co, McKay`s Case 
 ;31 
 Re Caerphilly Colliery Co, Pearson`s Case 
 ;32 
 Nant-Y-Glo and Blaina Ironworks Co v Grave 
 ;33 
 Metropolitan Bank v Heiron 
 34 (in the analysis of 
 Metropolitan Bank 
 ,34 Mr Hunt says that the law took a wrong turning and that this case is the source and origin of the error which led to 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 ;27 and in referring to the particular passage of the judgment of James LJ to the effect that the learned Lord Justice could not `see how a bribe paid to an agent (could) be considered as money had and received for the use of the principal` Mr Hunt points out that the learned Lord Justice has been overtaken by the Privy Council in 
 Mahesan v Malaysia Housing Society 
 7); 
 Boston Deep Sea Fishing & Ice Co v Ansell 
 ;19 and 
 Eden v Ridsdales Railway Lamp and Lighting Co Ltd 
 .35
Mr Hunt in his third and final broad attack against 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 says that it is clearly and unacceptably out of line with the well-established principle of equity that a fiduciary should not be permitted to retain any profit, let alone bribes, obtained by abuse of his position. In accepting bribes, a fiduciary agent puts himself in a position of conflict with his duty of loyalty which he owes to his defrauded principal and I understand Mr Hunt to be submitting that a court of equity must not countenance the taking of bribes and must use every available means to deter corrupt practices.
On behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir Mr Eder says that the absence of any proprietary or `tracing` claim with regard to bribes was established by two Court of Appeal cases, viz 
 Metropolitan Bank v Heiron 
 34 and 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 which made the clear demarcation even in equity and when considering equitable remedies between 
 obligation 
 and 
 property 
 . He emphasizes that 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 has been cited with approval and applied in 
 Powell & Thomas v Evan Jones & Co 
 ;36 
 A-G v Goddard 
 ;37 
 Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver & Ors 
 ;38 
 Reading v The King 
 ;22 
 Mareva Compania Naviera SA of Panama v International Bulk Carriers SA 
 ;39 
 `The Siskina` 
 ;40

 ;7 
 Barclay-Johnson v Yuill 
 ;41 
 Attorney General`s Reference (No 1 of 1985) 
 ;42 
 Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines v Denby 
 .43 He says even in Australia, 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 was cited with approval in 
 Wespac Banking Corp v Markovic & Ors 
 .44 Mr Eder for reasons which I will set out later disagrees with Mr Hunt and contends that the earlier English cases are not inconsistent with 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 .27
I now return to the analysis in detail; unfortunately, and unavoidably, it has to be extensive and intensive.
Since 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 ,27 it has been generally assumed that there is no proprietary or `tracing` claim against a bribed agent where the bribe is in the form of money.
The plaintiffs were a company manufacturing silk spinners and dyers. The deft Stubbs, who was a foreman dyer in their employment, had for some years been entrusted by them with the purchase at market prices of the stuff which they used in the process of dyeing. Stubbs on behalf of his principals bought a lot of goods from Varley & Co who, as an inducement and reward for Stubbs` purchase orders, and without the knowledge of the plaintiffs, paid Stubbs large sums of money by way of commission. The commission was paid by an agreed formula. It was alleged that over a period of some nine years, Stubbs received bribes totalling about o5,541 with which Stubbs had bought land and other investments. A portion of the bribes was allegedly still held in cash. On discovering the receipt of bribes, the plaintiffs in the action sought to follow the bribes into the investments. In the action, they claimed, inter alia, for (1) the o5,541; (2) damages, and an inquiry as to the amount; (3) the necessary accounts; and (4) an inquiry as to what property and securities represented such bribes and proper conveyances and transfers thereof, and the appointment of a receiver thereof meanwhile. The plaintiffs then sought an interlocutory injunction to restrain Stubbs from dealing with the land in question and for an order directing him to bring the other investments and cash into court.
The matter was heard by Stirling J. The learned judge said the question before him was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to follow the bribes into the investments, that is, whether the plaintiffs had a proprietary or `tracing` claim to the investments. Counsel for plaintiffs relied on the case of 
 Morison v Thompson 
 30 and counsel for Stubbs submitted that the bribes were never the property of the plaintiffs and he relied on the authority of 
 Metropolitan Bank v Heiron 
 ,34 which was decided by the Court of Appeal of which Cotton LJ was a member. Learned counsel for Stubbs submitted to the learned judge that 
 Morison v Thompson 
 30 had nothing to do with the case. This submission was accepted by Stirling J. Mr Hunt says this was too narrow a view to take of 
 Morison v Thompson 
 .30 I shall return to these cases later. Stirling J held that the plaintiffs could not take the investments. He drew a distinction between money, if any, paid by the plaintiffs to Stubbs for a particular purpose and Stubbs misapplied it and the money which was paid by an outside third party. In the former case, the learned judge said that the plaintiffs` money left with Stubbs would have been clothed with a trust and they could have followed it into the investments in equity, following the famous rule laid down in 
 Taylor v Plumer 
 .45 In the latter case, the learned judge after considering both 
 Morison 
 30 and 
 Metropolitan Bank 
 34 came to the conclusion that the bribes from Varley & Co were held only as a debt, recoverable in an action for money had and received. He dismissed the motion for the injunction. The plaintiffs appealed. The appeal was heard on 3 May 1890 and two days later, the Court of Appeal (Cotton and Lindley LJJ) delivered judgment. The strong Court of Appeal affirmed the learned judge`s decision and decided that the relation between Stubbs and",1992-12-03 00:00:00,SG High Court
