    JUDGMENT1 On his way home from work on the 12th April 2005 Vasanthan Kandiah took a short cut across Parramatta Golf course. He was 50metres along a path that runs along the eastern border of the golf course when he was robbed by four youths. Matthew Thomas has been charged with robbing Mr Kandiah at that site whilst in company of three other youths.2 His trial was set down for the 6th November 2006 at Parramatta District Court. The strength of the prosecution case against him hinges upon identification evidence of Vasanthan Kandiah. Three months after the robbery Mr Kandiah was shown an array of 20 photographs by police. The procedure was video taped. A CD was made of the computer program photo array as the displayed array was actually interacted with by a police officer at the direction of Mr Kandiah. The CD therefore contains a virtual replay of the computer screen display as responded to by Mr Kandiah. Mr Kandiah selected a photograph of the accused, Matthew Thomas, as being one of the persons who participated in the robbery.3 Upon arraignment the accused pleaded not guilty. Mr Nematalla, his counsel, has objected to the reception into evidence of the videotape, the CD or any other evidence relating to the identification of the accused by Mr Kandiah on the 8th July 2005. A pre-trial voir dire was held to determine whether evidence of the photo array and subsequent identification of the accused should be admitted. At the conclusion of the hearing I indicated I would admit the evidence over the objection of defence counsel. These reasons seek to chronicle the objections and my reasons for admitting the evidence.4 Mr Nematalla’s first objection was that the photo array infringed s115(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act) – that is, the pictures viewed by Mr Kandiah suggested they were pictures of persons in police custody. The practice pursued by police on this occasion is a well established procedure. Mr Nematalla’s argument was critical of the established procedure, arguing photographs of the kind currently used by police are expressionless, eyes looking directly into the camera. His argument is such a pose is symptomatic of mug shots.5 His second objection was that the quality of the identification by Mr Kandiah was so weak that I should exercise a discretion given under s 137 of the Act to exclude the evidence because of the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. The unfairness is said to centre upon a cumulative effect touching matters pre identification and the identification process itself. 6 The statement of Mr Kandiah disclosed to the defence reveals that on the date of the robbery:  *Mr Kandiah’s description of the robber he ultimately identified as the accuse was minimal – Caucasian, male, late teens, medium build, approximately 170cms tall; *Mr Kandiah supplemented that description with the comment that he could not remember much more; *According to Mr Kandiah’s statement the offence occurred about 6:00pm on an autumn evening. He described the lighting as dark with some inadequate lighting on the footpath.7 At the time of the array Mr Kandiah selected two photographs: - photograph 1 [an unknown male unconnected in any way with the robbery] and photograph 2, a photograph of the accused. He also spent significant time studying two other photographs. The actual selection of the accused photo came after Mr Kandiah had used a post-it sticker to cover portions of the face exposed on the computer screen. Mr Nemetella argued in these circumstances the identification fell so far short of a positive identification that it would be unfair to the accused to admit the evidence.8 A third objection related to the unfairness of admitting evidence of two earlier alleged contacts between the accused and Mr Kandiah. The first in time was said to have been 3years prior. The second was a week before. Mr Kandiah’s allegations were that he though the same males, presumably including the accused, were involved in throwing rocks at him 3years earlier. In the second incident the youths, including the accused, had allegedly followed Mr Kandiah in the same area the week before the robbery. The second incident had been reported to the police. That evidence, the defence argued appeared to contradict a recorded assertion in Mr Kandiah’s statement on the night of the incident that he had not seen these males before. There had been some discussion between Mr Kandiah and a neighbour in respect of one or both of these recent incidents. The neighbour, a former high school teacher had nominated to Mr Kandiah a number of suspects including the accused. 9 In the course of the voir dire hearing the Crown tendered four statements of Mr Kandiah, a statement from his neighbour, the video recording of the identification array, a CD replay of the computer screen display, a transcript of the video recording, a statement of Dt Orth who conducted the photographic array, and a computer printout of the 20 photographs constituting the array. The defence tendered the facts sheet presented at the bail hearing.10 I viewed the CD program in court. At the time of writing this judgment I uplifted Exh E from the trial which contains 28 printouts of each discreet display presented on the computer screen. The first 7pages contain the information: 
     
     You have been asked to look at a picture array containing images of a number of people 
     Each image is identified by a number 
     This presentation can be replayed if you wish, however it is important to look at the entire presentation 
     You should understand that this presentation may not contain an image of a person involved in this incident 
     Please indicate if you are able to identify any person whose image is in this presentation 
     Please do not discuss this case with any other witness or tell them, in any way, whether or not you have identified any person.  
     The presentation will commence after this slide. 
    11 Thereafter each of the following 20 pages contains a single photograph 11cms x 9cms (as reproduced on paper). Each photograph shows a young male, apparently no younger than 18years and no older than 25years. Each male appears expressionless. All photographs are sharp in focus. Each captures only a full front-on face, neck and the inner aspect of the shoulders. Only one photograph shows what I might call the “bust line” of its subject. No male is wearing a cap. Most males are wearing a T-shirt or sweat shirt with no collar. Six of the photographs, however, do show subjects wear a collar. All backgrounds are a single soft colour – although the colour varies from blue to grey, to fawn and mixtures. In some of the photographs the head occupies a greater proportion of the photograph than in others. My own view is that those preparing an array should ensure that a suspect’s face should not draw attention to the eye of a viewer by virtue of the fact that the face occupies either a significantly larger or smaller area than others in the array. There is nothing in the present array suggesting any unfairness in presentation of head sizes.12 The complaint of the defence, of course, is the photographs as presented suggest the subjects are in police custody. It is a feature of modern life that photographic identification is regarded as essential. One cannot enter a taxi without noting an identification photograph of the driver to whom it is issued. Many work places require staff to carry photographic identification. Passports, and in some instances even registration in some sports or sporting events requires photographic identification. Every driver in NSW has a photograph of himself or herself incorporated into the licence.13 Sometimes the photograph is flattering of the subject, on other occasions not so flattering. None of the photographs taken in the situation just referred to suggest their subjects are pictures of persons in police custody. Such photographs are constructed in a format similar to each of the photographs contained in the array. True, many identification photographs available in the community contain a smiling subject. Equally many do not. The absence of a smiling countenance does not necessarily suggest a person in police custody.14 One of the photographs (No.4) shows a subject with his eyes almost closed – perhaps so that little of the eye colour is visible. Many of the photographs in the old police identification photograph books contained subjects in a similar pose – eyes almost closed and an expressionless face. Although other minds may differ, to me this photograph is capable of suggesting that particular person could be in police custody. Equally, it is also capable of suggesting the subject had recently abused alcohol or drugs. On either basis it should not have been included in the array.15 I have considered whether the presence of that picture taints the whole array. S.115 (2) of the Evidence Act 1995 provides: 115 Exclusion of evidence of identification by pictures (1) …. (2) Picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible if the pictures examined suggest that they are pictures of persons in police custody.16 What is prohibited is any suggestion arising from the collection that the pictures are pictures of persons in custody. It should be noted the nouns “pictures” and “persons” are in the plural. No doubt the intent is to ensure that there can be no suggestion the accused, whose picture formed part of the array, was in custody at the time his picture was taken.17 What constitutes a picture suggesting a person is in police custody (as distinct from some other custody) need not be defined. It is not a closed set. No doubt the traditional “mug” shot of full front-on face accompanied by a side on profile shot would qualify. Equally photographs of a person wearing handcuffs accompanied by two large burly uniformed police would also qualify. It is to be remembered a generation ago, witnesses were often invited to look through large collections contained in large folio books of “mug” shots to see if there was anyone they could identify. That was a practice distained by defence counsel and recognized by courts as being fraught with problems. 18 Again while minds may differ, any presentation of photographs in rows as is done in VD Exh 7 creates an aura of men in a line-up of photographs. However, in the photograph identification array, each photograph appears singly on a computer screen. It remains on the screen for as long as the witness requires. When a witness finishes studying one photograph he may summon the next. It too appears alone upon the computer screen. When each photograph in this particular array is viewed singly there is only the one (No.4) capable of suggesting the subject may have been in police custody. The presence of that one photograph in the array does not trigger any suggestion the other photographs are pictures of persons in police custody.19 I am satisfied the array of photographs as presented to Mr Kandiah on the 8th July 2005 did not contravene s.115 (2) of the Act. I am satisfied the picture identification evidence is admissible.The Second Objection20 The second objection was predicated upon a proposition that the quality of the identification evidence to be led was so impaired that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.21 The Act recognizes that identification may, in the best of circumstances be unreliable. More so, when that identification is achieved through photographs. Hence special provisions such as s.115, s.116 and s.165 seek to provide a framework where by the jury becomes aware of the potential for unreliability and the special need for caution in accepting identification evidence, and if accepting it, giving it weight in their deliberations. Matters going to the quality of identification evidence particularly the environment in which the initial observations were made and any impediments that may have impacted upon the opportunity to observe an offender are specifically required to be addressed by the judge in directions to the jury. Juries are directed, in cases such as this where honesty is not contested, that even so, the accuracy of the witness is vital.22 Prior inconsistent statements are matters clearly going to the accuracy of the witness. The failure to give a detailed description to police at the time of the offence goes to the question of they witness’s eye for detail, and likewise to the witness’s accuracy. 23 Identification evidence is crucial to the Crown’s case. There is circumstantial evidence capable of supporting the identification made by Mr Kandiah. On the Crown case the accused was the last person Mr Kandiah saw with his mobile phone after it was stolen. Again on the Crown case the accused was demonstrably in possession of the phone two days after the robbery. That possession continued thereafter until the accused’s arrest.24 On the Crown case the accused fits the, albeit limited, description given by Mr Kandiah of the male who took his phone.25 The potential for danger of unfairness needs to be evaluated against the state of the evidence. The arguments for jury consideration on evidence favouring the defence on identification are capable of being catalogued easily for its consideration. To the ones above can be added the time taken by the victim to study the photographs, his selection of four photographs, his selection of a person unconnected as a potential for one of the robbers, and so on. Likewise the arguments for jury consideration on evidence favouring the Crown are capable of being easily catalogued. The Crown looks to Mr Kandiah for explanations for each of these criticisms. It argues each is answerable – the answer to be found in the evidence of Mr Kandiah. Much will depend upon the view the jury takes of Mr Kandiah’s credibility. The attacks the defence raises upon the evidence really are attacks upon the acts of Mr Kandiah and his accuracy. That is a classic jury question. I do not regard there being any danger of unfair prejudice.26 If I be wrong, I am of a view any danger there may be of unfair prejudice would not outweigh the probative value of the array of photographs before Mr Kandiah and his selection of the accused’s photograph as being a person involved in the alleged robbery.27 The defence’s third complaint relates to the Crown being permitted to adduce evidence of recognition. The Crown case is that on two prior occasions the paths of Mr Kandiah and the accused had crossed. The first occasion was said to be 3years ago when some males threw rocks at Mtr Kandiah. It was said the accused was among them. The second incident had been reported to police the week before. It was an allegation the accused had followed Mr Kandiah. 28 Both episodes, as it seems to me, raise coincidence and tendency issues. No notice has been given to the defence. The accused was born in 1984. He is currently 22 years old. At the time of the offence he would have been 20 or 21years old. Three years ago he would have been 18 or 19. The maturation process may have made some changes in his appearance. The claimed recognition is tenuous. The probative value of this material to the claimed identification made at the photograph array is not all that significant. 29 The unfairness to the accused, in respect of the first incident is that he is seen to be acting violently whilst in a group against the same victim in the same area or nearby area. The event was three years previous. No complaint was made to the police. The second incident, where there was a following, raises, perhaps less obliquely the sense of violence through possible stalking in company of 3 others. The second incident the week before also raises coincidence. The Crown case in the instant case is four youths in this indicted offence stalked the victim in the same area the previous week. Further, the evidence could lead to improper speculation that the offender was casing or otherwise engaging in acts preparatory to the robbery. While the value of this second incident may well be greater than the first, there is a real danger the unfairness flowing to the defence case from the reception of the evidence will outweigh the probative value it adds to the photograph identification evidence.30 The evidence of both incidents is rejected.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: David Morris Macindoe appears for sentence today having committed a number of offences of great concern to the community. He committed those offences whilst under the influence of a mental illness from which he has suffered for sometime. That fact suggests that less weight should be given to general deterrence and that the offender will do his time in custody harder than he might otherwise. It also has implications for the offender’s moral culpability, but it also works the other way, because the very factors which suggests that less weight should be given to general deterrence require that more weight be given to the protection of the community due to the danger that Mr Macindoe poses to its members.2 On the evening of Friday 14 April 2006 the offender was in the vicinity of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. It is apparent that he spent a great deal of time in that location. A young woman, Nicole Livesley, and her boyfriend, Daniel Mussen, were sitting in that area when the offender walked up to them. They did not speak and they saw the offender going through rubbish bins and walked in a northerly direction. Without warning the offender came at Ms Livesley. He was armed with a bottle and swung it at Ms Livesley. The bottle broke, causing significant wounds to Ms Livesley's face and shoulder. After that the offender went towards Mr Mussen. He waved the broken bottle in close proximity to Mr Mussen, saying “Come on cunt come on.” He then began to run away. Another person in the vicinity, Mr Lunetta, had heard the commotion and he ran towards Ms Livesley. As he did this the offender pointed the broken bottle at Mr Lunetta. He was screaming at Mr Lunetta as he did so. Ambulance officers were called and Ms Livesley was taken away for treatment. The offender was located a short time later and he was taken to the police station, where he participated in an interview with them. 3 The offender pleaded guilty at an early opportunity to maliciously wounding Ms Livesley and assaulting Mr Mussen. When I sentence him for the malicious wounding matter he asked that I take into account the offence of assaulting Mr Lunetta.4 He also asked that I take into account a matter that occurred two days earlier, when he committed the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon a Ms Badby. She was walking near the Art Gallery of New South Wales on 12 April 2006, when, for no apparent reason, the offender punched Ms Badby to the side of her face. Ms Badby suffered from bruising to the left side of her cheek. At the time she was with her fourteen year old daughter and another fourteen year old friend of her daughter’s. The impact thus of this offence was not only on Ms Badby, but also it represented a significant breach of the peace, causing distress to two young girls.5 The matters on the Form 1 indicated a greater need for retribution and personal deterrence than would otherwise be the case. 6 What was it that led Mr Macindoe to commit these violent offences upon complete strangers? As I mentioned at the beginning of these remarks on sentence Mr Macindoe has for a number of years suffered from a mental illness. It is a condition of that mental illness that he hears voices. It appears that he perceives that people are subconsciously or telepathically communicating with him, calling him racist names such as nigger. On 14 April 2006 he perceived that some people were calling him nigger using their subconscious, although apparently Ms Livesley was not. 7 Dr Westmore, who saw the offender, has assessed him as suffering from chronic schizophrenia of the paranoid type. He actually considered that on the balance of probability Mr Macindoe was not guilty, suffering from a mental illness which would have totally deprived him of his capacity to know that he should not do the act.8 The Crown asked me to disregard this, because of statements in the interview that Mr Macindoe had with police which indicate to the contrary and which it is apparent Dr Westmore was not aware of. 9 Mr Evenden, who appeared for Mr Macindoe, also asked me to disregard that insofar as it suggested that Mr Macindoe was not guilty. He made it clear that the offender admitted his guilt and thus as part of that admitted that he knew in a moral sense that what he was doing was wrong. That is a significant matter in assessing the moral culpability, because although the offender’s moral culpability is lessened by the circumstance that he perceived people to be insulting him telepathically, as the crown has pointed out this morning, there are clear indications in the interview with police that the offender knew very well what he was doing and knew that what he was doing was wrong. He was provoked by the words he believed he heard, but he was certainly not acting in self defence to the situation as he perceived it. He simply, as Mr Evenden said, “Lost it.” That explains why he would smash a bottle into the face of Ms Livesley even though he did not perceive her to be one of those people telepathically insulting him. Thus, although the offender, of course, is deserving of considerable sympathy because of the fact that he suffers from his mental illness he is not deserving of sympathy when he chooses to angrily retaliate against those who in his mind call him racist names, and, more importantly, those who happen to be nearby those who as he perceives things call him racist names. He told police that he assaulted Ms Livesley and Mr Mussen because they were easy prey. 10 It is be noted that it is a matter of obvious aggravation that on 14 April 2006 the offender was on bail for the matter committed on 12 April 2006. 11 Although the offender has suffered from a mental illness for a significant period of time, as was pointed out to me, his criminal history records on it only some infrequent and relatively minor matters. However, things appear to have escalated considerably in recent times. The crown tendered to me, over objection, information concerning other actions of the offender, where he was violent towards people for no apparent reason. He was dealt with on those occasions under s 33 of the Mental Health Act.12 I am more concerned with the offender’s actions than the way they were disposed of, because one of the most important, in fact, the fundamental rationale of sentencing is to protect the community.13 There are clear elements in the material before me suggesting the offender’s dangerousness, especially if he is not treated for his mental illness. I do not mean to suggest any element of moral blameworthiness when I say that there are indications that the offender has a lack of insight into his condition. He has told the Probation and Parole officer that whilst he is willing to continue fortnightly injections for the treatment of his schizophrenia illness he saw no need to have regular consultations with a psychiatrist.14 The offender’s parents separated at a very early age and he has been raised by a variety of carers. He has seen his natural mother only once and has a very strained relationship with his natural father, who was imprisoned in 1990 after being convicted of having sexual intercourse without consent of the offender’s sister. He was raised in a home with his natural father and then with foster parents as well as other relatives. For many years he has lived on the streets. 15 He was diagnosed with schizophrenia about ten years ago and has been hospitalised on occasions, both as a voluntary and involuntary patient. One of the complications in this case involves the fact that the offender, as well as having an underlying mental illness, exacerbates his condition by consuming illegal drugs. He does not agree with the precise record of his drug consumption, as contained in the Pre-Sentence Report, but does agree that he has consumed drugs in the past, including the drug Ice. 16 The protection of the community due to an offender’s dangerousness is a matter which a sentencing judge is entitled to take into account, provided, of course, that he does not receive a longer sentence than would objectively be required. Within that constraint I am able to increase a sentence to reflect the need to protect the community. I am satisfied that it is necessary to do that in this case. 17 The attack on Ms Livesley was a very serious one, involving a nasty weapon. She has been left with entirely foreseeable consequences. They are both psychological and physical. She now has an unsightly scar on her arm and as recorded in her Victim Impact Statement she is embarrassed by this and is unable to wear clothes she would otherwise wear, because she needs to hide that scar.18 The psychological impact on Mr Mussen is also significant and again is entirely understandable and foreseeable. 19 The offender pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. That is a matter which carried both with it a utilitarian benefit and also a suggestion of remorse. The utilitarian benefit for an early plea is, according to Thompson & Houlton, usually to be accorded a discount of somewhere around 25 per cent, but that is a matter which is the subject of discretion. There will be cases, as Thompson & Houlton recognises, where to allow a discount of twenty-five per cent for an early plea of guilty leads to an inadequate sentence. I have not discounted the sentence I would have imposed on the offender by twenty-five per cent, because I consider that to do so would lead to an inadequate punishment upon him and would inadequately protect the community.20 One thing is clear, and that is this: the offender will be released from custody. It is in the community’s interest that he be supervised upon that release for an extended period. I will, therefore, vary the ratio between non parole period and head sentence from a statutory ratio in order to provide that extended period of supervision on parole. 21 Mr Evenden asked that I impose concurrent sentences, because these two offences were committed during the one episode. That is true, but it must be recognised that two people have suffered, one more so than the other, of course, by the offender’s two separate offences and so there will be a slight element of accumulation in the sentences I will shortly announce.22 The crown did ask me to find that it was an aggravating circumstance that a weapon was used. It is not an element of the offence of malicious wounding that a weapon was used, but it would almost always be the case. So I will not increase the sentence merely because a weapon was used on this occasion.23 For the offence of assault committed on Mr Mussen the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I impose a fixed term of one year, to commence on 14 April 2006. That is a fixed term because of the sentence I will now announce. 24 For the offence of malicious wounding, taking into account the two matters on the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of two years, to commence on 14 July 2006. It will expire on 13 July 2008, on which date the offender is to be released to parole. I set a head sentence on the malicious wounding matter of four years so the offender is eligible to be released to parole on 13 July 2008.

      Introduction 
       
      
    3 The applicant was charged on indictment that on 26 February 2004 he: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. did wound Jogi Naidu with intent to murder him contrary to the  
        Crimes Act 1900  
        s 27. 
         
         
        2. maliciously did wound Jogi Naidu with intent to do grievous bodily harm to him contrary to the  
        Crimes Act 1900  
        s 33. 
         
         
        3. maliciously did wound Jogi Naidu contrary to the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
         s 35. 
        
       
      
    4 The offences were charged in the alternative. A maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment is applicable to breach of either section 27 or 33. A standard non parole period of 10 years pursuant to Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is applicable to an offence under the Crimes Act 1900 s 27 and 7 years in respect of an offence under the Crimes Act 1900 s 33. 
     
      
    5 On 11 October 2005 the applicant was found not guilty on count 1 but guilty on count 2. No verdict was taken on count 3. 
     
      
    6 On 3 February 2006 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court in respect of count 2 to imprisonment for a non parole period of 7 years commencing on 27 February 2004 and expiring on 26 February 2011 and a balance of term of 2 years and 4 months to expire on 26 June 2013.  
     
      
    7 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against that sentence. The grounds of appeal are: 
     
      
    1. His Honour erred in a finding of fact which amounted to a breach of the principles of De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383; 
     
      
    2. His Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances; 
     
      
    3. His Honour erred in imposing the standard non parole period pursuant to Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; 
     
      
    4. The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    8 The sentencing Judge provided a summary of facts and evidence given in the trial in his Remarks on Sentence. In short: 
     
      
       
      (a) The applicant, who was 22 at the time of the offence, had been brought up in a Fijian Indian community outside Nadi, Fiji. He completed his schooling at age 18 and his studies included English in which he was reasonably fluent. 
       
       
      (b) He had progressed through the ranks of amateur boxing and had taken out a number of title fights in Fiji including one at the Fiji Games in the bantamweight division. The victim, also of Fijian Indian descent, had come to Australia many years previously. He was acquainted with the applicant’s family. On a visit to Fiji, the victim suggested that the applicant come to Australia to further his boxing career and his lifestyle. The applicant, at the victim’s suggestion, borrowed money from friends and relatives and came to Australia on a tourist visa.  
       
       
      (c) The applicant arrived in Australia in October 2003. He stayed with the victim who was a paraplegic. The applicant did not pay any rent to the victim, nor was any rent sought. The applicant had offered to pay the victim money for rent but the victim had told him to wait until he had established himself in Australia. The victim assisted the applicant to find employment in a cleaning business in Australia. The applicant did that job for some weeks.  
       
       
      (d) Their relationship degenerated after it came to the victim’s notice that the applicant had made telephone calls for which he had not paid the victim and the applicant had failed to repay cash advances made by the victim to him. Whilst the amounts of money involved were small, his Honour found they were relatively large to the victim, given his status as a pensioner. The victim left notes in the applicant’s room or around the house, where the applicant could read them. Those notes requested payment of the accounts. 
       
       
      (e) On the evening before the incident (which occurred in the early hours of 26 February 2004) the victim had gone out and had at least one beer. He came home and put on some music tapes. 
       
       
      (f) After about two or three hours the applicant came into the lounge room and asked the victim to turn the music down because he had to work the following day. That occurred at about 3am. 
       
       
      (g) The applicant went into the kitchen and came back with a carving knife. He was wearing dark leather gloves. When the victim said “What are you doing?” the applicant said “Do as I tell you. This is the last day of your living.” 
       
       
      (h) The applicant dictated what was described as a suicide note to the victim who complied. The applicant told the victim to start praying. The victim put some Hindu ash on his forehead. He was told by the applicant that he was going to die and to go to his bedroom and lay on his bed.  
       
       
      (i) The victim went to his bed. The applicant put the carving knife he was carrying on the cupboard and sat on the bed next to him. On the victim’s account the applicant started to choke him. There was a struggle. The applicant then pulled the victim’s left arm and with the carving knife sliced across his hand from the thumb side to his little finger side. There was a deep cut of between 4 and 7 centimetres. The victim felt a warm sensation. He said there was a lot of blood and a lot of pain. He thought he was going to bleed to death. 
       
       
      (j) After about 20 or 30 minutes, there was a further conversation, when it seemed the victim was able to persuade the applicant that he would not tell the police that he had tried to kill the victim. Thereafter, the applicant got the victim some water in a bowl on 2 or 3 occasions and assisted him bandaging the wound to his wrist. The victim asked to be taken to Liverpool Hospital. The applicant and the victim went outside the house and the victim directed the applicant to make contact with a neighbour. That neighbour was unable to assist and accordingly the two of them went to a nearby service station where a telephone call was made and an ambulance attended and took the victim to the hospital. 
       
      
    9 His Honour stated that the applicant’s account of the events was substantially similar to that of the victim. Where there was conflict in the evidence his Honour preferred the evidence of the victim. 
     
      
    10 The Crown case was that there was a plan by the applicant to make it look as though the victim had committed suicide. The applicant admitted in cross-examination that he had read an article in Fiji about a young person who had committed suicide by slicing his wrists. After the incident, the applicant also cleaned up the blood from the mattress, washed the sheets, hung them and the doona cover out to dry in the backyard. He also cleaned the knife and returned it to the kitchen with a group of other similar carving knives. The applicant said he was trying to teach the victim a lesson.  
     
      
    11 His Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        It seems, in the light of the evidence … that considerable bad blood had been built up, although suppressed, for many months and those months while [the applicant] had been living with [the victim] in close quarters. I accept [the applicant’s] evidence that there may have been comments made by [the victim] about [the applicant], his mother and his family which precipitated the eruption of violence in the early hours of the morning of the incident, when taken into account the fact that music was being played which was clearly annoying to the applicant. 
        
       
      
    12 The victim’s injuries required surgery. The injuries were described by his Honour as: 
     
      
       
        
        … scarring on the wrist from the thumb to the little finger side of about six to seven centimetres in length … The majority of the tendons in the wrist were cut or damaged. Of the ten tendons in that area of the wrist only three were not damaged. There was a deep laceration and the cut to the wrist which may have been stopped by the bones. The lacerations had gone through the skin, the tendons and the artery. 
        
       
      
    13 In addition the evidence disclosed there was injury to the victim’s median nerve, that the victim’s dominant hand was his left which was the hand which was injured, and that his use of the hand was significantly impaired, a matter of considerable relevance as he is wheelchair bound.  
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
       
      Ground One - His Honour erred in a finding of fact that amounted to a breach of the principles of De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 
       
      
    14 The High Court in De Simoni held at 389: 
     
      
       
        
        … a judge, in imposing sentence, is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence.  
        
       
      
    15 The applicant submitted His Honour in his Remarks on Sentence, transgressed the principle in De Simoni when he made the following comments in his Remarks on Sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) [The applicant] also gave evidence that while or before the victim was writing the suicide note, he, [the applicant], slapped him across the face a number of times to ensure that [the victim] thought he was serious. I do not accept that evidence. In my view, what was done was done to terrorise [the victim] and to ensure that he, [the victim] wrote the note as it was dictated for the purposes that [the applicant] clearly had.  
        
       
       
        
        (b) It was only after [the victim’s] wrist wound did not bleed – it would seem by virtue of the spontaneous closure of the artery – that it became clear to the [applicant] that the [victim] was not going to die. That was evident from the fact that the [victim] was able to continue conversing with the [applicant]. It seems that at that stage, the [applicant] thereafter changed his mind and he assisted the victim to bandage his wrist and travel out of the house, initially to the neighbours and then to the service station, where he was ultimately able to obtain some medical assistance. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) In terms of the aggravating factors, in my view, the facts indicate there was a level of pre-meditation and planning of the offence. This included the [applicant] having thought out the plan to have the victim write a suicide note out at the [applicant’s] direction to make it appear that it was a suicide and to intimidate the victim into writing the note as directed. 
        
       
      
    16 These remarks appear to be consistent only with an attributed intention to murder the victim. Accordingly, notwithstanding his Honour’s referral, correctly, in the Remarks on Sentence to the terms of the jury verdict and his findings consistently with that verdict it does appear that in determining the application of the standard non parole period he had regard to aggravating factors contrary to the principle in De Simoni. Accordingly I uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two - His Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances. 
       
      
    17 Notwithstanding an offence under the Crimes Act 1900 s 33 is subject to a standard non-parole period pursuant to Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 there remains a role for special circumstances under s 44 of that Act. While many of the factors which qualify as special circumstances will be taken into account as factors specifically listed in s 21A in determining the appropriate non-parole period, it does not necessarily follow that its work its fully done at that stage, although caution will need to be exercised to avoid inappropriate double counting - Regina v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [109] and [110]. 
     
      
    18 His Honour in his Remarks on Sentence said: 
     
      
       
        
        I then turn to the question of special circumstances. I was informed that [the applicant] is currently on a criminal justice visa and it is likely that he will be deported from Australia at the end of his sentence and indeed, at the end of his non parole period. The prospect of any supervision in Australia at the end of his custodial sentence is, therefore, non existent. The issue arises as to whether he should receive the benefit of any variation to the statutory ratio and to ensure that he is treated in the same way as any other offender.  
        
       
      
    19 The applicant submitted in his written submissions that his Honour decided that due to the likelihood of the applicant’s deportation and therefore the absence of the supervision of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service, there was no basis warranting a departure from the statutory ratio and that such conclusion was contrary to The Queen v Shrestha (1991) 173 CLR 48 at 71 and R v Mirzaee [2004] NSWCCA 315 at [20]-[21]. 
     
      
    20 This submission in my opinion is misconceived. His Honour’s remarks are to be read as raising two matters, firstly the issue whether there should be any variation of the statutory ratio at all and secondly to ensure the applicant was treated in the same way as any other offender notwithstanding that it was likely that he would be deported from Australia. That this was his Honour’s position is made clear from the exchanges during the sentencing hearing see (Transcript 11 October 2005 at 5/35): 
     
      
       
        
        His Honour: … his criminal justice visa will come to an end and he will be deported immediately, but he is entitled to be considered for the provisions of the adjustment to the statutory ratio as would any other person in his position regardless of the impact of that matter. See also (Transcript 11 November 2005 page 28/50) 
        
       
      
    21 The reason his Honour refused to make the finding of special circumstances was not that there was a likelihood of deportation but because: 
     
      
       
        
        … in the circumstances, particularly in the absence of any available evidence, I do not see any basis on which I can make a finding that special circumstances exist which would warrant a departure from the statutory formula. 
        
       
      
    22 However, there was evidence of factors which could be regarded as constituting special circumstances. These were referred to in the applicant’s submissions on sentence and comprised special hardship to the applicant in custody given he was a foreign national who has few friends and no family in the country; that this was his first prison sentence; his minor criminal record; his relative youth; his good prospects of rehabilitation; his low to moderate likelihood of re-offending; degree of remorse; and co-operation within the gaol system. The fact that the applicant provided some assistance to the victim after the event was, his Honour said, to the applicant’s credit, presumably evidencing some contrition. However his Honour had found the assistance followed the victim agreeing he would not tell the police the applicant had tried to kill him.  
     
      
    23 His Honour’s statement that there was an absence of any available evidence to provide a basis for a finding of special circumstances was erroneous. 
     
      
      Ground Three - His Honour erred in imposing the standard non parole period pursuant to Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
       
      
    24 As previously stated, the statutory non parole period for an offence under Crimes Act s 33 is 7 years. This represents the non parole period applicable to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    25 In Regina v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at 191-2 this Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        117 In order to give the Division practical utility it seems to us, in the light of the foregoing analysis, that a sentencing judge must ask and answer the following question: “are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?”  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        118 That question will be answered by considering:  
         
          
           
          (i) the objective seriousness of the offence, considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind; 
           
           
          (ii) the circumstances of aggravation, and of mitigation, which are present in the subject case, or which apply to the particular offender, as listed in s 21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s 21A(1). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        119 Depending upon the considerations referred to in the first of these paragraphs, it may become immediately apparent that the case is not one for which the standard non-parole period specified in the Table was intended to apply.  
         
         
        120 Whatever be the case in that regard, the considerations referred to in the second paragraph may similarly provide a reason for a departure from the standard non-parole period.  
         
         
        121 If the question, which we consider should be posed, is answered in the affirmative, then it seems to us that the Court should exercise its sentencing discretion in accordance with established sentencing practice and by reference to the matters identified in sections 3A, 21A, 22, 22A and 23 of the Act. The ultimate objective remains one of imposing a sentence that is just and appropriate, having regard to all of the circumstances of the offence and of the offender, and so as to give effect to the purposes mentioned in s 3A of the  
        Sentencing Procedure Act 
        . 
        
       
      
    26 The Court in Way construed “objective seriousness” at [85] –[93]. His Honour held as to the objective seriousness of the offence that the offence was at least at the mid range scale of gravity. The applicant, in his written submissions, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        His Honour determined the offence fell into the mid range of objective circumstances and no challenge is made to the finding.  
        
       
      
    27 However the applicant submitted there was error by his Honour in his consideration of the matters referred to in paragraph 118(ii) of Way’s case by reason that his Honour failed to take into account the matters referred to in [22] above. 
     
      
    28 His Honour held in that regard: 
     
      
       
        
        The accused is a relatively young man. He has got no offences in this country, at least of a relevant nature, but nothing else that was put to me – and I take into account the submissions that were made – that seems to me to be sufficient to warrant a departure from the guideline established by the legislature which has been the subject of various Court of Criminal Appeal decisions in this State. 
        
       
      
    29 I respectfully disagree with his Honour that such matters did not warrant a departure from the standard non parole period. The issue was compounded by his Honour taking into account aggravating features which implicitly involve an intention to murder. 30 A further basis for departing from the standard non parole period was put. This was the applicant’s second trial for these offences, the first trial not having completed. The applicant apparently had made an offer to plead guilty before the first trial to the offence of which he was ultimately convicted. The applicant submitted that the offer of a plea of guilty should have been taken into account by his Honour in determining whether there were reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. The applicant relied upon Regina v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 where this Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        [15] … There has been a long practice, however, in this court and in trial courts to take into account the offer of a plea of guilty which matches the crime for which a person is ultimately convicted.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [16] The offer of that plea of guilty or, in usual circumstances, the actual plea of guilty, is of benefit to the person charged broadly in two ways: It is taken as an indication of remorse and contrition for the offence committed and, second, there is what is described as the utilitarian value of the plea; this includes the relief of the State from having to call witnesses and, indeed, the reliefs to the various witnesses of the burden of having to give evidence and potentially being cross-examined. 
        
       
      
    31 His Honour said as to this matter: 
     
      
       
        
        …However, [the first] trial terminated for other reasons and on the second trial there was no similar plea made along those lines. It has been put on behalf of the [applicant] that was an ongoing situation. Nevertheless, the clear option available to those representing the [applicant] in those circumstances was to enter that plea before the jury on that second occasion … What was also clear was that all counts were in issue on the second trial and that what was also run was a defence of self defence in those circumstances. It was also an aspect of the conduct of those proceedings that the [applicant’s] evidence (and case) was to be that he was, essentially, brought to Australia and he was, if not in a situation of being trapped, certainly subject to enormous pressure by an arrangement by [the applicant] and others. 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        I have considered this matter, particularly as it does seem to me to be one of the few relevant mitigating factors available to the offender, but it does not seem to me that there has been any real benefit to the total criminal justice system. I include in that, not only the Court and the jury, which had to go through a full trial, but also to the police, DPP and the Crown and the calling of all witnesses. Relevantly also [the victim] had to give evidence which was the source of some considerable discomfort and angst to him.  
        
       
      
    33 In the present case it is not possible to conclude from the available facts that the offer remained outstanding at the time of the second trial. The legal representatives who made the offer had ceased to represent the applicant during the running of the first trial. His Honour made no finding that the offer was outstanding at the time of the second trial. The absence of satisfactory evidence that the offer of a plea of guilty to count 2 remained open up to the time of the second trial distinguishes this case from Regina v Oinonen. 
     
      
    34 Additionally whether a discount is given for a plea of guilty is discretionary. In the circumstances his Honour’s decision not to allow a discount was within the bounds of a sound discretionary judgment and does not demonstrate error. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
      Ground Four - The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    35 The applicant’s written submission in this regard was that: 
     
      
       
        
        taking into account the matters argued in support of the previous grounds of appeal, overall his Honour, notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence, imposed a sentence, which was manifestly excessive in the circumstances. 
        
       
      
    36 At the hearing reference was made to a table of cases and Judicial Commission statistics. The statistics establish that since 1 February 2003 5 out of 11 cases of breach of the Crimes Act 1900 s 33 have resulted in a sentence of a non parole period of 7 years imprisonment or greater. In my opinion this evidence did not materially assist the argument that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive or such that some other, less severe, sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed.  
     
      
    37 As I have upheld some of the previous grounds of appeal it is unnecessary to separately consider this ground. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    38 In my opinion there was evidence which his Honour could and should have taken into account in relation to the application of the standard non parole period and special circumstances. That evidence is outlined in paragraph [22] above. His Honour also on occasions erred in implicitly ascribing an intention to murder to the applicant contrary to his and the jury’s findings. The matters referred to at [22], properly considered, should have resulted in a reduction of the standard non parole period. 
     
      
    39 In my opinion a sentence less severe was warranted in law. The sentence which should have been passed was a non parole period of 5 ½ years with a balance of term of 2 ½ years. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    40 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
    1. Grant leave to appeal; 
     
      
    2. Allow the appeal; 
     
      
    3. Quash the sentence and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a non parole period of 5 ½ years commencing on 27 February 2004 and expiring on 26 August 2009 and a balance of term of 2 ½ years to commence on 27 August 2009 and expire on 26 February 2012. The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 26 August 2009.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 The prisoner, Mark Esposito, was found guilty by a jury on 16 August 2006 of the offence of manslaughter of Hao Nam Tran, in the alternative to a charge of murder upon which indictment the prisoner had been tried commencing 7 August 2006.2 The circumstances giving rise to the death of Mr Tran were substantially not in dispute at trial. On 13 August 2004, Mr Tran and his associates had gone to the prisoner’s home at Hinchinbrook and had made threats of violence towards the prisoner, who was not at home, and to the prisoner’s de facto wife in the presence of his children.3 Whilst the motive for this offence remained obscure, it appears that Mr Tran was under the impression that the prisoner owed him money, possibly arising out of a drug debt. These events were reported to police and Mr Tran was subsequently charged with a home invasion offence.4 On the afternoon of 16 August 2004, the prisoner and several of his associates gathered at the home of a Mr Hanchard. Included in the prisoner’s associates was one Khaled Hayek, an expert in martial arts, and known by the prisoner to be so qualified. The prisoner’s de facto wife was also in attendance. There was a discussion between Hayek and others concerning the threats made by Mr Tran towards the prisoner’s family. The evidence of the prisoner’s de facto spouse suggested that at the time of this conversation the prisoner was otherwise engaged, playing with his children in the backyard of the premises. In any event, it seems clear that Hayek indicated his intention to teach Mr Tran a lesson. 
     
      
    5 The prisoner either independently or in association with the plan hatched by Hayek agreed to meet Mr Tran on the evening of 16 August 2004. The prisoner told his de facto wife in the course of conversations which were the subject of listening device intercepts in the days and weeks following Mr Tran’s death, that he did not want to take Mr Tran to Hayek’s premises but that Hayek insisted. The prisoner was at Hayek’s unit in Cabramatta at the time that Mr Tran was instructed to come, and the prisoner remained there after Mr Tran arrived.6 The forensic evidence, namely, a quantity of blood splatter on the curtains and walls of the living area, and on the wall and floor of the bathroom, together with the content of the prisoner’s subsequent conversations with his de facto spouse, establish that Mr Tran was assaulted within the unit principally by blows to the head, most likely inflicted by Hayek striking Mr Tran with his feet, then enclosed in shoes.  7 The terms of the prisoner’s conversations with his de facto wife established the prisoner’s presence during the assault and the prisoner’s participation in an agreement with Hayek to exact some retribution for Mr Tran’s treatment of the prisoner’s family. There was however no evidence capable of establishing that the prisoner himself participated in the assault. When it became clear that Mr Tran had died from the injuries inflicted by Hayek, the prisoner assisted in disposing of the body by dumping it in Broad Street, Cabramatta, in the early hours of 17 August 2004.8 The jury’s verdict therefore accepted the proposition that the prisoner was a party to an agreement with Hayek to assault the deceased, and that the prisoner’s knowledge of Hayek’s qualifications in martial arts brought with it a realisation that Hayek would assault the deceased by way of unlawful and dangerous acts.9 The objective gravity of this offence must be measured principally in terms of the unlawful death of a human being which is, in any circumstances, regrettable and worthy of punishment. Whatever the antecedents and reputation of the deceased, it must never be forgotten that the law places considerable value on the worth of a human life. However the prisoner stands to be sentenced for his part in an agreement to inflict some harm upon Mr Tran, absent any evidence of actual blows inflicted by the prisoner. 10 This aspect of the matter brings me to a consideration of the role played by Hayek in the deceased’s death. It is a matter of some surprise and concern that Hayek was not charged in relation to the death of Mr Tran despite the identification of blood splatter on the shoes of Hayek. It appears that Hayek seized the opportunity afforded by a police interview to substantially blame the prisoner for the deceased’s death. As a result of the prisoner’s conviction and an extended interview with police in the expectation that the prisoner might provide the prosecuting authorities with some assistance, some consideration is presently being given to charging Hayek with an offence arising out of the death of Mr Tran, however I am informed that the Director does not regard the prisoner as a reliable witness given the lengths to which the prisoner went to distance himself from any role in the assault upon Mr Tran, and that it is unlikely that the prisoner will be of any assistance in any forthcoming prosecution of Hayek.11 The extent to which the prisoner should receive a discount on the sentence otherwise appropriate to the objective gravity of the offence on account of the information provided by the prisoner to police in the course of the extensive interview conducted on 15 November 2006, is the subject of some contention. The prisoner’s senior counsel submitted that the issue of the prisoner’s reliability in any forthcoming prosecution of Hayek was a question for the jury.  
     
      
    12 That is a self-evident proposition but one that is likely to remain theoretical in the light of the Director’s present refusal to call the prisoner to give evidence against Hayek. However the Crown Prosecutor accepts that it is appropriate to nominate a discount on the basis that the prisoner will be identified within the prison system as an informer, thereby placing himself at personal risk and affecting his conditions of custody, see RNM v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 375.  13 It should also be borne in mind that the legal representatives for the prisoner offered a plea to manslaughter on 23 June 2005 when the matter was still before the Local Court. It was indicated at that stage that the prisoner would assist in the prosecution of other persons involved in the assault upon Mr Tran. 14 The Director formed the view that the offer of a plea should be considered after the prisoner had provided an induced statement. No such induced statement was provided. In addition, the Crown indicated its willingness to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter shortly prior to trial, but that offer was ultimately rejected and the trial proceeded.15 I accept that the prisoner was willing to assist the authorities at various times, but that the prospect of retaliation towards himself and/or members of his immediate family dissuaded him from that course. Having regard to the factors set out in s 23(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I do not regard a discount of more than fifteen per cent as warranted in the circumstances of this case.16 The innocent complexion that the prisoner places upon his presence in the unit on the night of Mr Tran’s death is also consistent with the lack of remorse demonstrated by the prisoner in the course of his contact with Probation and Parole for the purposes of preparing the pre-sentence report that is now exhibit B on sentence. The prisoner continues to deny the commission of any offence.17 I turn to the prisoner’s subjective circumstances. The prisoner is the youngest of three children born in 1971. In 1973, the prisoner’s mother was struck by a train and died. The prisoner’s father remarried one year later to a woman who had two sons by a prior relationship. The prisoner’s father and stepmother had a daughter. When the prisoner was seven years of age, and there were six children in the family, the prisoner witnessed his stepmother’s death in a car crash. The family then broke up, with two of the prisoner’s stepbrothers leaving to reside with their grandmother.18 Not surprisingly, the prisoner describes his childhood as unhappy. The prisoner also alleges a period of ongoing sexual abuse as a child at the hands of a relative.19 The prisoner left home and commenced to frequent Kings Cross where he was introduced to heroin. For approximately three years, the prisoner was predominantly homeless and part of the Kings Cross drug subculture until his first custodial sentence in 1992 for property offences and assault with intent to rob. Prior to that time, the prisoner had received the benefit of probation and recognisances for a large number of property offences committed between 1988 and 1989.20 The prisoner has had two prior significant relationships, one between 1989 and 1991, resulting in the birth of a daughter who currently lives with her mother, and a further relationship between 1995 and 2000 resulting in the birth of another daughter. The prisoner has the custody of that daughter, whose care has been undertaken by the prisoner’s present de facto spouse. This third and continuing relationship has been on foot since 2000 and has resulted in the birth of a third daughter. The prisoner’s de facto partner is supportive and looking forward to the prisoner’s release from custody.21 The prisoner left school at the age of fourteen years and began work in the construction industry, primarily as a cement renderer. He claims that there have only been two years in which he has not been employed since 1994, other than periods of time spent in custody. The prisoner has expressed an intention to seek a career outside the building industry upon his release.22 The prisoner’s history of heroin abuse commences at the age of sixteen years. It is promising however that he has been on a methadone programme at various times, most notably between May 2000 and August 2004. He claims to have abstained from heroin use for up to seven years but has relapsed on occasions.23 His criminal history is consistent with intermittent addiction, that is, primarily it consists of property offences. The last custodial sentence was imposed in November 1999, resulting in the prisoner’s release in January 2000. 24 I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as guarded, although I was impressed by his de facto spouse, who is a highly intelligent woman seemingly devoted to the prisoner. She is capable in my view of influencing the prisoner for the better. 25 The prisoner has been in custody solely in relation to this offence since 3 September 2004. Accordingly, the sentence will be imposed from that date. I have determined that the prisoner’s need for further supervision in the community to assist him to avoid a relapse into drug abuse constitutes special circumstances.26 Taking all these matters into account, I regard a head sentence of eight years imprisonment appropriate to the prisoner’s objective and subjective criminality. Applying a discount of fifteen per cent to that sentence I have determined to impose the following sentence.27 You are convicted. I sentence you to a term of six years and ten months imprisonment commencing 3 September 2004 expiring 2 July 2011. I fix a non-parole period of four years to date from 3 September 2004 expiring 2 September 2008, after which time you are eligible for release to parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ADAMS J: I agree. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree. 
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The applicant Leisa Reed seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon her by O’Connor DCJ in the District Court at Gosford on 16 June 2006. 
     
      
    4 The applicant pleaded guilty to a charge that between 27 January 2004 and 21 February 2004 at Toukley in the State of New South Wales she did on 3 separate occasions supply a prohibited drug, namely amphetamine, for financial reward, namely on 28 January 2004, 5 February 2004 and 20 February 2004. 
     
      
    5 The offence being contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 is punishable by 3500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years or both. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months and an additional term of 12 months. His Honour ordered that the non-parole period be served by way of periodic detention. The applicant was ordered to report to the Periodic Detention Centre at Parramatta on 28 June 2006 to enable the sentence to commence. The non-parole period was expressed to expire on 27 June 2007 with the additional term to expire on 27 June 2008. 
     
      
    7 The first ground of appeal is that the Judge erred by failing to give effect to the applicant’s pre-sentence custody and quasi-custody. 
     
      
    8 The applicant appeared for sentence on 24 March 2006. Probation and Parole reports had been tendered which assessed her as being unsuitable for community service or periodic detention. 
     
      
    9 The Judge was well into his sentencing remarks when Mr Barber, counsel for the applicant, drew his attention to the fact that a further pre-sentence report had been ordered by Gibson DCJ but not received (ROS 24/3/06 at p16). Prior to being interrupted the Judge had remarked (ROS 24/3/06 at p 15): 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has been in custody for this offence, I am told, for some ninety one days before being bailed. Additionally, she has spent some six months in rehabilitation at Guthrie House which apart from the two weekends per month is a twenty four hour supervised regime. Rehabilitation in such circumstances can be regarded as quasi-custody. Mr Barber has submitted that the offender is entitled as a result to credit of some three months for the period that she has spent at Guthrie House. I accept this submission.  
        Taking into account the period on remand and the period whilst in rehabilitation I am of the view that any sentence to be imposed should be backdated to 24 September 2005.” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    10 It is evident on that day the Judge intended to backdate “any sentence” by six months for the time the applicant had spent in custody and at Guthrie House.  
     
      
    11 The applicant had resided in Guthrie House which offered a residential rehabilitation service for women for some six months. Whilst there she had met all the expectations of Guthrie House including participation in the group work program and taking responsibility for recovery from alcohol and drug dependencies. The applicant had a history of abusing amphetamines from the age of twelve.  
     
      
    12 Ms Hastings, the manager of Guthrie House, had given evidence and provided a report to which his Honour referred to extensively in his remarks. She was described by the Judge as “very supportive of the offender”. (ROS 24/3/06 at p 7 – 10). 
     
      
    13 Prior to the proceedings being adjourned, his Honour in discussions with Mr Barber said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your client’s in danger of going to gaol today for a period of two years, twelve months non-parole  
        backdated to September, so it’d be another six months” 
         (emphasis added) [Transcript 24/3/06  
        
       
      at p 21]. 
       
      
    14 On 16 June 2006, the applicant appeared before the Judge when sentence was imposed. His Honour had before him a Probation and Parole Report dated that day assessing the applicant as suitable for both community service and periodic detention. 
     
      
    15 Prior to commencing his sentencing remarks, the Judge informed counsel that he had come to the view that any custodial sentence be served by way of periodic detention. The following exchange took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “Barber: Your Honour previously indicated a minimum term of 6 months. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: No, I didn’t indicate that all, I was indicating a 12 and 12. 
        
       
      
     Barber: I am sorry. Did your Honour …… 
     
      
       
      His Honour: I took into consideration the period in custody and the period in respect of the rehabilitation she had undertaken to backdate that. I do not backdate the periodic detention order so that will be a period of periodic detention for 12 months. In giving periodic detention I think it reflects the leniency in relation to the offence. Mid-week is only available at Parramatta. 
       
      
     Barber: Yes Parramatta please.” (Transcript 16/ 6/06 at page 8 )  
     
      
    16 The Judge during his remarks on sentence said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I regard the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case as one which incorporates a non-parole period of 12 months and an additional term of 12 months. I am further of the opinion that the offender be permitted to serve this sentence by way of periodic detention… 
        
       
       
        
        The reason for permitting the sentence to be served in this fashion is that the offender has already been in custody for some 91 days and has made excellent progress in her rehabilitation. Periodic detention will permit the rehabilitation to continue and to allow her to care for her infant child. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst I recognise it is more lenient than full time custody in the circumstances I do regard it as an appropriate punishment for the offence which satisfies the requirements of s 3A of the  
        Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act. 
        ” (ROS 16/6/06 at pages 4, 5)  
        
       
      
    17 The contention for the applicant is that the Judge having determined that two years was an appropriate term by way of full time custody ought to have reduced that period by the full time and quasi-custody served. The failure to do so, it is submitted, has resulted in a longer sentence (by way of periodic detention) than his Honour intended the applicant to serve. 
     
      
    18 The Crown submits that whilst the Judge would have taken the pre-sentence and quasi-custody into account in relation to a full time term of imprisonment by backdating the sentence, the comparable leniency in a term of periodic detention meant that it was no longer appropriate to reduce the sentence by this discrete amount. Rather, it was part of the range of facts that resulted in a sentence of less severity than originally envisaged. It would have been inappropriate the Crown contends to have further reduced the term of the sentence. This is particularly the case given periodic detention’s inbuilt leniency.  
     
      
    19 It is not contentious that the 91 days in pre-sentence custody and six months in residential rehabilitation at Guthrie House were equivalent to six months full time custody. 
     
      
    20 Clear guidance to the approach to be taken to the imposition of a custodial sentence to be served by way of periodic detention is provided by this Court in Douar v R 159 A Crim R 154 per Johnson J at [69-73] which identifies a three stage process. 
     
      
    21 The sentencing Judge is to first consider whether there are any alternatives to the imposition of a term of imprisonment, if not, then to determine an appropriate period of imprisonment and then to consider whether any available alternative to full time custody should be utilised. 
     
      
    22 The Judge in the present case on 24 March 2006 appears to have considered that there was no alternative to a term of imprisonment and then determined the appropriate period of imprisonment was two years with a non-parole period of 12 months backdated to September 2005. The non-parole period in effect was to be six months (supra) (transcript 24/3/06 at p 21). 
     
      
    23 The Judge on 16 June 2006 considered that periodic detention was an available alternative to full time custody. His Honour correctly decided that he could not backdate the sentence of periodic detention: s 70 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 70 requires a Court having made a periodic detention order to fix the date of commencement of the sentence so that the date of commencement occurs no earlier than 7 days and no later than 21 days after the date on which the order was made. 
     
      
    24 It was open to the Judge to give effect to the period of full time and quasi-custody served by reducing the non-parole period by six months. His Honour decided it seems that he would not do so as the time spent in such custody and quasi-custody was reflected in the leniency of the sentence of periodic detention. The Judge in effect extended the term of imprisonment to be served by six months. In my view, his Honour was in error and the first ground of appeal has been established.  
     
      
    25 The inappropriateness of compensating for the leniency which is involved in periodic detention by extending the term of imprisonment to be served in this way has been emphasised by this Court: R v Stephen [2003] NSWCCA 377 [at 23], R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405 [at 22]. 
     
      
    26 As Johnson J said in Douar [supra] [at 71]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second step is reached where the Court has determined that no penalty is appropriate other than a sentence of imprisonment. The Court is next to determine what the term of that sentence should be. This has been regarded as the first step of a two-step approach:  
        Foster  
        at [30];  
        Zamagias 
         at [26]. The determination of the term is to be made without regard to whether the sentence will be immediately served or the manner in which it is to be served. This is because any of the alternatives available in respect of a sentence of imprisonment can only be considered once the sentence has been imposed. It follows that the term of the sentence cannot be influenced by what order might be made after the sentence has been imposed. The sentence cannot be increased because it is to be served by way of periodic detention:  
        Wegener 
         at [22];  
        Zamagias  
        at [26].” 
        
       
      
    27 The second ground of appeal is that the sentence imposed upon the applicant’s co-offender gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant. 
     
      
    28 The co-offender to whom the applicant refers is Brett Anthony Peele. 
     
      
    29 An agreed statement of facts was tendered when the applicant was sentenced which may be conveniently summarised. On 28 January 2004, a registered informant rang an associate of the applicant and spoke with the applicant about obtaining an ‘eight ball’ (one eighth of one ounce) of amphetamine. The applicant arranged to supply the amphetamine and met the informant with the co-offender on the same day. She supplied 2.73 grams of amphetamine to the informant in exchange for $400 cash. 
     
      
      On 4 February 2004 the applicant contacted the informant and supplied her on the next day with 3.08 grams of amphetamine in exchange for $450 cash.  
       
       
      The applicant contacted the informant on 19 February 2004 and on the next day supplied her with 3.32 grams of amphetamine in exchange for $450 cash.  
       
       
      The total amount supplied was 9.13 grams. The street value of the drugs supplied were estimated to be approximately $4,550 based on $50 street deals at 0.1 gram. 
       
      
    30 The co-offender pleaded guilty to three offences of supply amphetamine contrary to s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act at the District Court at Gosford on 20 April 2005. The maximum penalty for the offence is 15 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    31 The Judge’s remarks on sentence reveal that in respect of the offence of which he is the co-offender with the applicant, the co-offender was approached by the applicant to drive her to the informer’s residence. He accompanied her to the premises on that day and observed the transaction which occurred. At the meeting the informant asked the co-offender if she could contact him for the supply of drugs in the future and he agreed. The informant was supplied by the co-offender it appears with 3.6 grams of amphetamine on 4 February 2004 for which she paid $400 and 3.29 grams on 12 February 2004 for $400. 
     
      
    32 His Honour sentenced the co-offender for the supply committed with the applicant to a term of imprisonment of two years and three months with a non-parole period of 17 months. Concurrent terms of imprisonment of two years and three months comprising non- parole periods of 17 months were imposed for the second and third offences which were not in common with the applicant. 
     
      
    33 The applicant contends in written submissions that having regard to the applicant’s pre-sentence and quasi-custody the applicant received a sentence three months longer than that imposed upon her co-offender. However, assuming this Court corrects the contended error and reduces the sentence by six months resulting in a sentence of 18 months periodic detention this does not correct the grievance which is engendered when comparison is made between the two cases. An effective starting point, the applicant submits, of imprisonment of two years (reduced on account of pre-sentence custody) is only three months less than that imposed upon the co-offender which is inadequate. The applicant in particular refers to the co-offender’s significantly more serious criminal record, having received numerous lengthy custodial terms including for supply and to the “extraordinary steps” taken by her towards rehabilitation.  
     
      
    34 This ground of appeal has no merit and may in my view be shortly disposed of. 
     
      
    35 The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment by the Judge to be served by way of periodic detention which is significantly less onerous than the sentence of full time custody to be served by the co-offender: R v Mouzomenos [2005] NSWCCA 203. The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty was one of ongoing supply contrary to s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and is considered to be more serious than the offence of supply contrary to s 25 of the same Act to which the co-offender pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    36 As Wood CJ at CL observed in R v CBK [2002] NSWCCA 457 [at 56]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I wish only to repeat the observations which I made in  
        R v Khaled 
         [2001] NSWCCA 169. Section 25A of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985 was introduced in order to provide a strong deterrent to those who may be tempted to engage in an ongoing trade in drugs. It needs to be clearly understood that s 25A offences are considerably more serious than s 25 offences, as is indicated by the increase in the maximum available penalty.” 
        
       
      
    37 The applicant moreover played a more substantial role in the supply on 28 January than the co-offender. The applicant negotiated the transaction with the informant and supplied the drug, approaching the co-offender to drive her to the informer’s residence. He accompagnied her and was an observer. 
     
      
    38 Appropriate weight was given by His Honour to the subjective circumstances and prior criminality of the applicant and the co-offender. 
     
      
    39 The sentences imposed by the Judge do not give rise to any justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant. The applicant has not shown that a reasonable person, looking at the circumstances of the case, would regard her grievance as justified: R v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251 (at 6), R v Kollas & Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 491 [at para 45 – 50], Lowe v The Queen (1985) 154 CLR 606, Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. The sentence, in my view, was a lenient sentence.  
     
      
    40 Error having been identified, this Court should form having regard to the nature of the error as required by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 an opinion that “some other sentence ……is warranted in law and should have been passed.” 
     
      
       
      
    41 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (ii) Quash the non-parole period imposed by O’Connor DCJ. 
       
       
      (iii) Sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of six months to date from 28 June 2006 and expire on 27 December 2006 with a balance of term of 12 months expiring on 27 December 2007. The term of imprisonment is to be served by way of periodic detention.

    2 HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Price J for the reasons given by him. 
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The applicant Van Phu Vu seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him by Judge Williams in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 28 January 2005. 
     
      
    4 The applicant requires an extension of time in which to make an application for leave to appeal against that sentence which the Crown does not oppose.  
     
      
    5 On 13 October 2004 the applicant upon arraignment pleaded not guilty to a charge that he on 25 July 2003 at St Peters in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin, being an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug and stood trial before Judge Williams and a jury of twelve. The Jury entered a verdict of “Guilty” on 18 October 2004. 
     
      
    6 The offence being contrary to s 25 (2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 is punishable by 20 years imprisonment and/or 3,500 penalty units. A standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment has been prescribed: s 54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and table in Division 1A. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years and 8 months to date from 11 July 2004 and to expire on 10 March 2015 with a non-parole period of 8 years to date from 11 July 2004 and expire on 10 July 2012. 
     
      
    8 The Notice of Appeal identifies three grounds namely: 
     
      
    Ground 1 
     
      
    His Honour erred by imposing a sentence that failed to adequately reflect the substantially less significant role played by the applicant compared with the role played by his co-offender, Tien Hung Vu. 
     
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
    His Honour erred by imposing a sentence that has left the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    Ground 3 
     
      
    The sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    9 The first ground of appeal makes reference to the co-offender Tien Hung Vu. Tien Hung Vu pleaded guilty to an indictment containing two counts, the first count being an offer to supply a large commercial quantity of heroin. The applicant was not involved in that offence. 
     
      
    10 A further offence on a Form 1 being a charge of supply of heroin was taken into account on sentence for the first count. The applicant was not involved in that offence. 
     
      
    11 The second count on the indictment charged that on 25 July 2003, Tien Hung Vu did supply a prohibited drug, namely, heroin, being an amount not less than the commercial quantity. The applicant was the co-offender in the commission of this offence and was, as previously stated, found guilty after trial. 
     
      
    12 In relation to the second count on the indictment, Tien Hung Vu was sentenced by Judge Williams on 28 January 2005 (the same day as the applicant) to a minimum period in custody of 6 years and 9 months. The commencement date of the sentence was 25 July 2003. A total term of 9 years was specified to expire on 24 July 2012. 
     
      
    13 In relation to the first count on the indictment and the Form 1, Tien Hung Vu was sentenced to a minimum period in custody of 9 years. The sentence was partially accumulated to date from 25 July 2005. The earliest date upon which the applicant was to be released on parole was 24 July 2014. A total term of 12 years was specified to expire 24 July 2017. 
     
      
    14 Judge Williams in sentencing Tien Hung Vu determined the offender was entitled to the benefit of a discount of 25% for his plea of guilty. His Honour, relevantly, identified the starting point of the non-discounted sentence for count 2 as 12 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    15 Tien Hung Vu sought leave to appeal to this Court against the severity of the sentences imposed. In Tien Hung Vu v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 188, Justice Hall, with whom James and Buddin JJ agreed, ordered that: 
     
      
       
      (a) Leave to appeal should be granted. 
       
      
     (b) The appeal should be upheld in relation to the total non - parole  period. 
     
      
       
      (c) A finding of special circumstances should be made. The  
       
       sentences imposed by the District Court should be set aside and Tien Hung Vu should re-sentenced as follows: 
       
       
      (i) As to Count 2, Tien Hung Vu was sentenced to a fixed term of  
       
       imprisonment of 6 years and 9 months to commence from 25 July 2003  
      
     and to expire on 24 April 2010. The fixed term was intended to be the  equivalent of the non - parole period determined by the sentencing  judge. 
     
      
     (ii) As to Count 1, (including the Form 1 offence) Tien Hung Vu was  
     
      
      sentenced to a non - parole period of 7 years to commence on 25 July  
      
     2005 and to expire on 24 July 2012 and a balance of term of 5 years  commencing on 25 July 2012 and expiring on 24 July 2017. Hall J  determined that there should be a partial cumulation of sentence to  reflect the total criminality.  
     
      
    16 The result of the appeal was a total effective reduction of Tien Hung Vu’s non-parole period of 2 years. The total effective sentence that Tien Hung Vu is now required to serve is 14 years with a non - parole period of 9 years rather than 14 years with a non-parole period of 11 years. In relation to Count 2, (the offence in which the applicant was involved) Tien Hung Vu is required to serve a fixed term of 6 years and 9 months which is intended to be the equivalent of the non-parole period for that offence determined by Judge Williams.  
     
      
       
      The offence 
       
      
    17 The facts of the offence the subject of this appeal may be distilled from the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence. An agreed statement of facts was tendered in the proceedings against Tien Hung Vu. The facts may conveniently be summarised as follows: 
     
      
    18 On 23 July 2003, the applicant and Tien Hung Vu (now referred to as the co-offender) flew to Brisbane and met the informant. The conversation was recorded. The sentencing judge recited that the informant gave evidence in the trial that the applicant had sat a short distance away and basically did not take much or any part in the conversation. His Honour was satisfied, however, that the applicant knew why the co-offender was at the informant’s house and had the capacity to understand what was being discussed if he cared to listen. The conversation and other telephone calls were in relation to the co-offender organising to supply the informant with 700 grams of heroin. 
     
      
    19 The co-offender wanted $300,000 for the heroin. The informant arranged to send the money by bus to Sydney on 25 July 2003.  
     
      
    20 The informant travelled to Sydney on that date and went to the bus depot with the co-offender and collected a box that was said to contain the money and placed the box in the co-offender’s vehicle. The co-offender drove off and was arrested shortly thereafter. 
     
      
    21 The applicant was located in the area in another vehicle, which was stopped and searched. An amount of white powder was located inside a box packed inside a rice cooker. The white powder was subsequently analysed and found to be heroin with a gross weight of 792.1 grams with a purity of between 56.5% and 57.5%.  
     
      
     
     
      
      The applicant’s subjective circumstances 
       
      
    22 The applicant was born on 11 December 1966, he, therefore, being 36 years old at the time of the offence and presently 40 years old. He is a married man with two children who at the time of sentence were aged nine and two. He is separated from his wife who has care of the children. 
     
      
    23 He was born in Vietnam and came to Australia in 1998, after spending seven years in Hong Kong, five of those in a refugee camp. 
     
      
    24 The applicant has a limited education, having completed only the equivalent of year 4. Prior to his arrest, he was unemployed or in partial employment. He claims that at the time of the offence he was in financial difficulties and his mother was sick in Vietnam. 
     
      
    25 The applicant admits a gambling problem but denied that he committed the offence to support his gambling habits.  
     
      
    26 He has no prior convictions. 
     
      
    27 A Probation and Parole pre-sentence report dated 28 January 2005 was before the sentencing judge. The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing.  
     
      
       
      Dealing with the Appeal  
       
      
    28 Ground 1 of the Appeal is that his Honour erred by imposing a sentence that failed to adequately reflect the substantially less significant role played by the applicant compared with the role played by his co-offender. 
     
      
    29 The applicant contends that his objective criminality was substantially less significant than that of the co-offender, that although his Honour was correct to conclude that his criminality was substantially less than that of the co-offender, the differential in the undiscounted starting points of the respective sentences was inadequate. 
     
      
    30 The undiscounted starting point in the co-offender’s sentence was 12 years whereas the applicant’s head sentence was 10 years and 8 months, representing a differential of 1 year and 4 months. The applicant asserts that this is a “very modest differential given that the applicant’s role in the enterprise was clearly subsidiary to that of Tien Hung Vu and the applicant fell to be sentenced in relation to only one matter whereas Tien Hung Vu was responsible for a course of heroin transactions over a period of time and included an offer to supply a large commercial quantity of heroin.” 
     
      
    31 Ground 2 of the appeal is that his Honour erred by imposing a sentence that has left the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    32 The applicant contends that as a consequence of his appeal, the co-offender is serving a total effective non-parole period of 9 years for much more criminality than that of the applicant who is serving a non-parole period of 8 years. Even taking into account, the fact that the applicant pleaded ‘Not Guilty’ whereas the co-offender pleaded ‘Guilty’ the applicant contends, that the differential in the two sentences is such that he has been left with a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
       
      
    33 These grounds of appeal raise the issue of parity of sentences.  
     
      
    34 Wood CJ at CL (as he then was) in R v Kollas & Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 491 [at para 45 – 50] provides a helpful synopsis of the relevant principles in relation to parity when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 45 The parity principle of sentencing established in  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1985) 154 CLR 606 and in  
        Postiglione v The Queen 
         (1997) 189 CLR 295 requires, as a condition precedent to appellate intervention, that there should be a marked disparity between the sentences imposed on co-offenders of a degree of kind which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. A sentence which offends that principle should be reduced. That may occur notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate, or within the permissible range of sentencing options (per Mason J in Lowe at 612 and per Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione at 301) and  
        R v Anderson 
         NSWCCA 25 March 1993 per Justice Hunt, Chief Judge at Common Law at p4. The Court, however, still retains a discretion to intervene in those circumstances, if to do so would be to produce a sentence which was totally inappropriate to reflect the objective criminality involved. 
        
       
       
        
        46 In determining whether the parity principle has been observed, as the judgments of Gibbs CJ (at 610) and of Mason J (at 613) in  
        Lowe 
         and of Dawson and Gaudron JJ (at 301), and of Kirby J (at 338) in  
        Postiglione  
         show the different circumstances of co-offenders, including the part which each played in the offence, as well as their subjective circumstances such as age, background, previous criminal history, remorse, rehabilitation prospects and the like, must be considered. 
        
       
       
        
        47 That follows from the circumstance, as Dawson and Gaudron JJ confirmed in  
        Postiglione 
         (at 301) that the parity principle is “ 
        an aspect of equal justice 
        ”. Equal justice requires, as their Honours pointed out, that “ 
        like should be treated alike, but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them.” 
        
       
       
        
        48 The principle is enlivened only where the disparity is such as to give rise to justifiable sense of grievance, or to the appearance of justice not having been done. As Kirby J pointed out in  
        Postiglione 
         (at 337): 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “So long as the sentencing Judge has taken into account the relevant considerations of law and fact, the appellate court will not ordinarily intervene merely because some arguable discrepancy appears between the sentencing of otherwise apparently connected or like offenders.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        49 This is associated with the principle of appellate restraint, and with the circumstance that sentencing can never be reduced to a precise mathematical exercise, or to one involving analytical certainty. Room must be left for discretion, and or an individual assessment of the facts by the sentencing Judge who has the benefit of seeing and hearing the evidence first hand. 
        
       
       
        
        50 The test for determining the existence of a sense of grievance is objective. That is, a person complaining of disparity must show that a reasonable person, looking at the circumstances of the case, would regard the offender’s grievance as justified:  
        R v Ilbay 
         [2000] NSWCCA 251 per Grove J (at par6).” 
        
       
      
    35 It was necessary for the sentencing judge to assess the applicant’s degree of criminality by defining his role and the level of his actual participation in the criminal enterprise: R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. 
     
      
    36 His Honour found that the applicant’s involvement was “substantially less” than that of the co-offender. He noted there was no evidence before him of substantial profit made by the applicant nor was there a suggestion or evidence that he was involved in any way with the other activities of the co-offender. His Honour remarked (ROS at p3): 
     
      
       
      “He really is someone who should be sentenced on the basis he was prepared for financial reward to take part in the supply of a commercial quantity of heroin although not being the actual supplier but apparently the carrier of the drug for the purposes of supply.” 
       
      
    37 His Honour “applying the approach suggested in Way’s case [2004] NSWCCA 131” was satisfied that this offence “for this offender” fell just below the middle range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
       
      
    38 The sentencing judge, in my view, carefully analysed and defined the applicant’s role in the joint criminal enterprise. He had also carefully analysed the co-offender’s role finding (ROS Tien Hung Vu at p5) that the co-offender was readily able to obtain large quantities of heroin, was able to negotiate price with respective purchasers and was able to hold particular quality batches of heroin for persons who wanted to obtain drugs of a similar quality. He remarked that the co-offender’s “admitted behaviour was part of an ongoing criminal activity….” (ROS Tien Hung Vu at p 7). His Honour found that the offences committed by the co-offender fell within the middle range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    39 The finding that the applicant’s involvement was “substantially less” than the co-offender was clearly correct. Although the sentencing judge was unable to precisely determine the co-offender’s standing in the drug hierarchy, he was at the very least a person of considerable significance. He was involved in the on going supply of heroin, was able to obtain large quantities of the prohibited drug, negotiate prices with respective purchasers and hold quantities of heroin for them. 
     
      
       
      The applicant on the other hand had travelled with the co-offender to the informant’s house in Brisbane where the sale of the drug was discussed and knew why the co-offender was there. He was the carrier of the heroin on the day of the arrest. The applicant had not previously been involved in the supply of heroin. 
       
      
    40 The applicant’s head sentence of 10 years and 8 months equates to 89% (round figures) of the undiscounted starting point of the co-offender’s sentence of 12 years. The differential of 1 year and 4 months does not adequately reflect, in my view, his Honour’s finding that the applicant’s involvement in the offence was “substantially less” than the co-offender. The disparity is such as to give rise to the appearance of justice not having been done and is such as to justify the intervention of this Court.41 In R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135, Wood CJ at CL, with whom Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreed, emphasised at [34] the importance of giving consideration: 
     
      
       
      “……to the well recognised principle that the culpability of those who engage, at any level, in drug supply networks is significant, and that deterrent sentences are necessary, since absent the involvement of couriers, warehouse men and so on, these networks, whether established for the purposes of importation or subsequent distribution, would simply collapse:  
      R v Le Cerf 
       (1975) 13 SASR 237 and  
      R v Laurentiu 
       and  
      Becheru  
      (1962) 63 A Crim R 402.” 
       
      
    42 Notwithstanding the applicant’s lesser role, the offence involved in this appeal is a serious offence. The applicant was knowingly involved in the commercial supply of 792.1 g of heroin of about 57% purity.  
     
      
    43 His Honour properly considered the harm and potential harm to the community in the case of heroin as being “enormous.” 
     
      
    44 The sentencing judge correctly identified the standard non–parole period as offering a reference point, although he found the applicant’s offending fell just below the middle range of objective seriousness. In so doing he was following what was said in Way (supra): see also R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575, MLP v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 271.45 The standard non-parole period is 10 years.  
     
      
    46 The findings of this Court on the co-offender’s appeal do not give rise to any justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant. The appeal to this Court succeeded only to the extent that the Court found that there were a sufficient number of relevant factual matters to justify a finding of special circumstances in the case of the co-offender: Vu v Regina (supra) [at 127]. The statutory ratio of the non-parole period taking into account accumulation of the offences was varied so as to equate to approximately 64% of the total term of imprisonment. The non-parole period of the offence in which the applicant was a co-offender was varied in effect by being converted into a fixed term.  
     
      
       
      
    47 This Court made a finding of special circumstances in the case of the co-offender. The sentencing judge did not find special circumstances in the case of the applicant and it was within his discretion not to do so. 
     
      
    48 It is unnecessary to consider Ground 3 of the appeal.  
     
      
    49 The Court, in my view, should form as required by s 6 (3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 an opinion that “some other sentence….is warranted in law and should have been passed” and proceed to re-sentence the applicant.  
     
      
    50 I consider that an appropriate sentence is a non-parole period of 6 years with a balance of term of 2 years. Such a reduction will not produce a result disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved: R v Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432  
     
      
    51 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) The extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal be granted; 
      
     (ii) Leave to appeal be granted; 
     
      
      (iii) Quash the sentence and non–parole period imposed by  
       
       Williams DCJ  
       
      (iv) Sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period  
       
       of 6 years to date from 11 July 2004 and expire on 10 July 2010  
       
       with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 10 July 2012.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ADAMS J: I have read the judgment of Howie J in draft. Subject to the comments below, as to the third ground of appeal, I agree with both his Honour's reasoning and conclusions. 
     
      
    2 The relevant passage in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 is as follows -- 
     
      
       
        
        ""[160] The Court should adopt the following guideline applicable to offences against State laws:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (i) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, e.g. assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    3 As has been frequently said in this Court, the extent to which judges given a utilitarian discount depends upon the exercise of the judge's independent discretion in the particular circumstances of the case. Nevertheless, that discretion must, of course, be exercised judicially. It should not be exercised capriciously or arbitrarily. Nor should it appear to be so. 
     
      
    4 It is self evident that the discount is directed to the date of a plea. Whilst, for example, prior admissions to police are plainly relevant, the time of arrest is not the time for a plea of guilty. The first occasion for a plea is at committal. It is notorious that, in many though not all cases, the charges can at this time be somewhat fluid: some might not be appropriate; there will often be doubling up; other charges may better express the criminality involved in the impugned conduct. Often, the process of refinement cannot usefully be undertaken until the entire brief has been provided, not only to those representing the defendant, but also to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. There is nothing in Thomson and Houlten that suggests that there mere undertaking of negotiations as to the charges or, for that matter, charge bargaining itself should be regarded as cutting down the appropriate discount. The guideline was promulgated in a context when those processes were a given and, moreover, encouraged. In my view, it will be a very rare case in which charge negotiations before committal should be regarded as justifying an otherwise appropriate discount.  
     
      
    5 Following committal charge negotiations also frequently occur. It is obvious that the defence has an interest in attempting to reduce the impact of the alleged criminal conduct whilst it is the duty of the prosecution to ensure that the charges which are ultimately the subject of the plea -- whether guilty of not guilty -- adequately represent the extent of the criminality that it is necessary to punish in the former situation or try in the latter. In light of this duty it is wrong in principle for the court to infer that an offender has obtained some advantage from a charge bargain to which he or she is not entitled and which therefore should reduce the appropriate discount. To the contrary, the assumption should be that the ultimate charges reflect the criminal conduct for which it is appropriate the offender should be punished. There are some exceptional cases where, although this is the case, the ultimate form of the charges is itself so advantageous to an offender that the form adopted itself reflects a form of discount. In such a case, giving the full utilitarian discount may amount to a double and inappropriate reward. Typically this might be expected to occur where offences are placed on a Form 1. But even in this instance, it should be assumed that the prosecution considers that the use of this procedure (after all, specifically provided for in the legislation) is in the public interest and that, overall, the charge together with the Form 1 offences, reflects the criminality sufficiently to permit adequate punishment. 
     
      
    6 The plain and essentially simple point made in the judgment was that the public interest required an explicit discount to be given where possible and the indicated range of 10% to 25% should be regarded as a guideline for the exercise of the relevant discretion. The reason is obvious. It is in the public interest that legal advisers be able to inform their clients as to the likely outcome of a plea. Arbitrary and unexplained departures from the guideline undermine this public interest. Nice distinctions and fine lines should also be eschewed. It is of the essence that the matter should be as clear, simple and predictable as circumstances permit. Of course, one reason for not extending the full otherwise available discount is that the resulting sentence would be below the appropriate discretionary range. But, in those cases, this should be stated in order to maintain the transparency of the process and the integrity of the guideline. 
     
      
    7 Justice itself is undermined by the appearance of arbitrariness. In some cases it is impossible to avoid the suspicion that the full 25% is withheld simply because the particular judicial officer simply thinks that the guideline itself is mistaken. 
     
      
    8 I come now to the facts in this case concerning the evolution of the charges. The matter was the subject of written submissions at first instance. It was submitted by the prosecution -- 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender and his wife were both arrested and charged on 6 May 2005. Through his legal representatives the offender made written representations on 22 December 2005 resulting in the amalgamation of a number of NSW  
        Crimes Act 
         charges to the ones now before the court, and the use of schedules in relation to the more minor matters before the court. There has been no change to the Commonwealth money laundering offences, though a back-up charge in relation to the charge against s400.5  
        Criminal Code 
         was withdrawn. As a result of the plea a number of similar NSW charges were withdrawn against the offender’s wife, as was a charge under s400.9  
        Criminal Code 
         relating to joint possession of the $155,600. 
        
       
       
        
        On that basis, on 11 January 2006 the offender entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court to the offences for which he now falls to be sentenced, some 8 months after his arrest. 
        
       
       
        
        While it is conceded that the pleas of Guilty were entered in the Local Court, that is, at an early stage in indictable proceedings, the Crown does not concede the pleas of guilty were entered at the first reasonable opportunity.” 
         
        
       
      
    9 Although no doubt it is reasonable to infer that there was a reasonable suspicion of such criminal involvement on the part of the applicant's wife as justified the bringing of charges against her, it cannot be inferred, let alone assumed, that she was guilty of the offences. In my respectful opinion, it is wrong in principle to ascribe some benefit to the applicant for the withdrawal of the charges against his wife. Accordingly, the mere fact that, as it happened, the prosecution agreed to withdraw those charges in the context of the negotiations with the applicant's legal advisers should not be considered as a reason for not according to the applicant the utilitarian discount otherwise appropriate. Although it is true that the charges against the applicant's wife were withdrawn there is no evidence, in my respectful view, that this withdrawal was a condition of the applicant's pleas as distinct from part of an agreement as to the appropriate way in which the charges should be dealt with. The same conclusion follows, it seems to me, in respect of the simplification of the charges. It cannot be right to proceed on the basis that the applicant is guilty of the other charges. Still less is this proper where the outcome is said to be an ""amalgamation"" of the charges. 
     
      
    10 The prosecution did not concede that the pleas were entered at the first reasonable opportunity, citing the circumstances set out above. Reliance was apparently also placed on the fact that the pleas were entered some eight months after the applicant's arrest. This seems to me to be a complete non sequitur. On the assumption that the charges ultimately pleaded to comprised a reasonable outcome, why should it be inferred that the prosecution's change of position was anything other than reasonable and, if reasonable, why should it be thought that the applicant's attitude to the original charges was unreasonable? Accordingly, with respect, I am unable to accept that the pre-committal negotiations are relevant to the question whether the plea was entered at the first reasonable opportunity. 
     
      
    11 There is nothing in the evidence, in my view that should rationally have led to the conclusion that the upper end of the utilitarian discount, namely 25%, should not have applied in the circumstances here. Nor did the learned trial judge give a reason for not applying that figure. At the same time, it seems that this Court has held that such apparently arbitrary determinations are within the discretion of the sentencing judge and ought not to be corrected by this Court. In my respectful view, such an approach undermines the purpose sought to be served by the guidelines. However, having registered my protest, I feel duty bound to follow those decisions.  
     
      
    12 Accordingly, I must reject this ground of appeal.13 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to three charges: two being offences against Commonwealth law and one a State offence. He was committed for sentence to the District Court. For reasons that are not relevant, he was arraigned on an indictment containing the three charges in the District Court and pleaded guilty. Ultimately he was sentenced by Judge Ainslie-Wallace (the Judge) and now seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
    14 The first offence for which he was sentenced was contrary to s 302A of the Crimes Act (NSW). It alleged that on 6 May 2005 the applicant had under his control a compact disc specifically designed for the making of false passports with the intention of inducing another to accept them as genuine. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The second offence was the possession of $155,600 reasonably suspected of being stolen, an offence contrary to s 400.9 of the Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty prescribed for this offence is imprisonment for 2 years. The third offence was money laundering involving the sum of $89,100. This is an offence contrary to s 400.5 of the Criminal Code for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    15 In respect of the third count the Judge took into account three offences each being the operation of a bank account contrary to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth). The Judge was also asked to take into account when sentencing for the State offence two offences of dishonestly possessing a driver’s licence. 
     
      
    16 On 19 May 2006 the Judge sentenced the applicant on the second count on the indictment to a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment commencing on 6 May 2005 and expiring on 5 May 2006. On the first count she sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years to commence on 6 November 2005 and to conclude on 5 November 2007. On the third count the applicant was sentenced to “a sentence of two years with an additional term of twelve months” to date from 6 May 2006 with the non-parole period expiring on 5 May 2008. 
     
      
    17 The overall sentence imposed was one of four years with a non-parole period of three years. The sentence was to date from 6 May 2005 and the applicant is eligible to be considered for parole on 5 May 2008. 
     
      
    18 It should be noted at the outset that the third offence was a Commonwealth offence yet her Honour purported to impose a sentence in accordance with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. No ground of appeal has been raised in relation to this formal defect in the sentencing but it is a matter that will need to be addressed regardless of the merits otherwise of the appeal. 
     
      
    19 The facts can be briefly stated. The applicant is an Indonesian citizen who last entered Australia unlawfully on 17 March 2003. He first came to this country in March 1997 but was deported on 7 April 2001 after serving a prison sentence. He then re-entered Australia on 23 July 2001 and departed on 5 February 2003 having committed further offences and outstayed his visa. He used different names to enter Australia on each occasion. 
     
      
    20 On 6 May 2005 Federal police conducted a search warrant on premises where the applicant lived with his wife and child. As a result $152,000 was found in a box in a cupboard in the bedroom. Police also located a CD Rom containing a computer program for making five Korean or Chinese passports. Two driver’s licences were found in different names but bearing the applicant’s photograph and several passport-sized photographs of different persons were also located. 
     
      
    21 In respect of the money found in the unit the applicant said that he had been given it to look after for a person he named to police. That person has been charged with offences relating to the use of false accounts. 
     
      
    22 Further investigations revealed that on 3 July 2003 a bank account was opened in one of the names used by the applicant relying upon the passport located in the applicant’s premises during the police search. Between 3 July 2003 and 23 September 2003 amounts totalling $97,000 were placed into that account. Over that period the applicant operated that account on nine occasions to send $89,100 to an account in Indonesia. 
     
      
    23 The applicant was born on 8 September 1973. At the time of his arrest he was residing with his wife of six years, also an Indonesian citizen, and a son aged three years. He has a criminal record for dishonesty offences dating from 2001. In January 2003 he was sentenced to a short term of imprisonment for a large number of dishonesty offences including making and using false instruments. He reported to the officer preparing a pre-sentence report that he had an ongoing gambling habit and occasional illegal drug use. However he said that his offending was due to an obligation he had incurred to others who had cared for his wife during his last prison sentence and while he was absent from Australia. 
     
      
    24 There was in evidence a psychological report but it contained little of relevance. The psychologist reported that the applicant was gambling heavily and incurred a debt of $5,000. He blamed his illegal activity on gambling and trying to keep from his wife that he was in debt. There were also before her Honour letters from members of the community including the applicant’s wife and a number of certificates in relation to courses he had undertaken while on remand. 
     
      
    25 The first ground of appeal complains that her Honour ought to have made all the sentences concurrent. The structure of the sentences was that each of the sentences for the first and third counts commenced six months after the commencement date for the preceding sentence; that is the sentence for the first count commenced six months after the sentence for the second count and the sentence for the third count commenced six months after that for the first count. The argument is that, because the offences were related by being part of a single episode of criminality, the sentences ought to have been made concurrent. It was asserted that the Judge failed to give reasons for not making the sentences completely concurrent and this was an error in the exercise of her discretion. 
     
      
    26 The Crown accepts that there were some common features of the three offences in that the applicant was in the business of being able to provide and use false documentation for the purposes of illegal banking transactions. However, the assertion on behalf of the applicant that it was a relevant factor that all of the documentation relevant to the offending which was found in the search of the applicant’s premises should be rejected. The fact that the evidence of a number of discrete offences is located in the one place is completely irrelevant to any question of how the sentences for those offences should be imposed. 
     
      
    27 In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both. 
     
      
    28 This issue was most recently discussed in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272 where the Court stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [11] One of the limiting principles that constrains a sentencing court in seeking to promote the purposes of punishment is the principle of proportionality. Another is the, not-unrelated, principle of totality and it is this principle that operated in the present case. It is the application of the totality principle that will generally determine the extent to which a particular sentence is to be served concurrently or cumulatively with an existing sentence in accordance with statements of the High Court as to the operation of the principle in Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59; Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v R (2004) 78 ALJR 616. 
         
         
        [12] In R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245, Street CJ described the principle as follows: (at 260) 
         
         
          
           … The principle of totality is a convenient phrase, descriptive of the significant practical consideration confronting a sentencing Judge when sentencing for two or more offences. Not infrequently a straightforward arithmetical addition of sentences appropriate for each individual offence considered separately will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances. In such a situation the sentencing Judge will evaluate, in a broad sense, the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and, having done so, will determine what, if any, downward adjustment is necessary, whether by telescoping or otherwise, in the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences. … 
          
         
         
        [13] In some cases the fact that a sentence for a particular offence is to be served completely concurrently with another sentence for a different offence will result in a sentence that is erroneously inadequate because it does not reflect the totality of the criminality for which the offender was to be punished for the two acts of offending: see for example R v Brown [1999] NSWCCA 323. This may be so even if the two offences arise from the same precise criminal act, such as the dangerous driving of a motor vehicle on the one occasion: R v Janceski (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 288. The same principle has been applied to sexual assault offences arising from a single incident of sexual assault: R v Gorman (2002) 137 A Crim R 326. Although, it has been held that a determination of the extent, if any, that a sentence is to be served cumulatively with another sentence is an exercise of discretion on which minds might differ, R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66, that discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality. 
        
       
       
      That was a case where it was held to be appropriate to impose a sentence completely concurrent with sentences then being served by the offender even though the offence, for which sentence was imposed, was a completely separate and discrete act of serious criminality. 
       
      
    29 In the present case the Judge, having nominated the sentences for each offence, stated that she proposed to make them partially cumulative in order to achieve the overall sentence that she believed was appropriate. This was in effect a short hand way of indicating that her Honour thought that the totality of criminality encompassed by the three offences warranted a specific sentence that could only be achieved by a degree of cumulation between the three offences. There was nothing more that the Judge needed to say in order to explain why she was structuring the sentences as she did. 
     
      
    30 In my opinion this ground is not made out. Whether it was open to her Honour to impose partially cumulative sentences depends upon whether it was open to her to assess the totality of criminality of the three sentences as she did. A determination of that issue depends upon a consideration of the other two grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    31 The second ground of appeal contends that the sentence for the third count was “unduly harsh and severe”. This was an offence that involved nine criminal acts over a period of two months whereby the applicant sent money from an account to Indonesia. The account was opened in a name used by the applicant with a passport found in his unit. The overwhelming inference is that he opened the account and that it was opened for the purpose of money laundering. It is clear that the applicant was involved in a fraudulent scheme of obtaining money by the use of false identities and then transferring the money out of Australia. Just what role the applicant played is unknown. The applicant did not enter into an interview with police and gave no evidence before her Honour. It was submitted that the applicant was a secondary offender, but in relation to all the offences before her Honour he was a principal and was to be sentenced as such. 
     
      
    32 There was little in mitigation of the offences. The applicant entered into this country unlawfully shortly after he was deported and commenced offending almost immediately. He had a record for similar offences for which he had been previously sentenced to prison. It is impossible in my view to conclude that it was not open to her Honour to determine that an appropriate sentence, taking into account the further offending, was imprisonment for three years as against a prescribed maximum of 15 years for this offence and this ground fails. 
     
      
    33 The third ground of appeal is that the Judge erred in not discounting the sentence by the maximum of 25 per cent by reason of the plea of guilty. Her Honour indicated that she was applying a discount of 20 per cent for the State offence. As argued orally the ground asserted that the Judge had not give a discount for the Commonwealth offences. In this regard her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I take into account that he pleaded guilty and that should be recognised as reflecting a willingness to facilitate the course of justice and in this case I accept that it contains within it an element of contrition and in relation to the State offence should reflect itself in a discount of 20 per cent of the sentence otherwise to be imposed. 
        
       
      
    34 For my part I do not understand why it should be thought appropriate to nominate a discount in respect of State offence but not for Commonwealth matters. I cannot see the logic in such approach and I do not believe that it is warranted by anything said in the High Court in Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339. Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048, which concerned sentencing for Commonwealth offences, makes it quite clear that it is legitimate for a sentencing judge to indicate a percentage discount for a plea of guilty or assistance to authorities, see per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ at [24]. But it is clear that her Honour was taking into account he plea of guilty in respect of all offences, and this is made obvious by the use of the words “a willingness to facilitate the course of justice” which is the way the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty in Commonwealth matters was expressed by some members of the Court in Cameron see per Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ at [13]-[15]. 
     
      
    35 In so far as there was any criticism of the percentage discount awarded, the short answer is that the applicant has no entitlement to any particular discount: R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286; R v Heikkinen [2006] NSWCCA 50. In any event the plea of guilty came eight months after the applicant was arrested and following negotiations with the prosecutor. The pleas of guilty were conditional upon charges being withdrawn against his wife. It was open in those circumstances for the Judge to determine that the appropriate discount was less than 25 per cent regardless of whether or not the plea of guilty is said to have been given at the first available opportunity, see R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion the overall sentence of four years with a non-parole period of three years was well within the Judge’s discretion except for the following point, one that was not taken as a ground of appeal but raised by the Bench with the parties during oral submissions. The issue concerns the appropriate non-parole period to be imposed when sentencing for a mix of both State and Commonwealth offences. 
     
      
    37 Two of the offences, including the most serious offence, were Commonwealth crimes. The activity in which the applicant was involved was money laundering, a Commonwealth crime, even though he committed at least one State offence in carrying out that activity. In sentencing for Commonwealth matters the Court has determined that in general an appropriate non-parole period falls between 60 and 66 per cent of the head sentence. It is to be noted that the sentence for the third count, a Commonwealth offence, contained a non-parole period that was two-thirds of the head sentence. However, by making the Commonwealth sentences partially cumulative with the State offence the non-parole component became three quarters of the total sentence, the statutory ratio for State offences, but an unusually high one for Commonwealth offences. 
     
      
    38 As has been noted, the Judge sentenced for the third count as if it were a State offence by apparently applying s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (NSW): the Judge nominated the non-parole period first and then the balance of the term. This is not the way that a sentence is imposed for a Commonwealth offence where the total term is imposed and then the non-parole period. It seems to me that the Judge was endeavouring to structure the sentences to accord with the State provisions rather than those of the Commonwealth. Yet as has been noted the most serious offence was a Commonwealth crime and the activity was generally in contravention of Commonwealth law. It was only incidental that the applicant also offended against State laws. It seems to me in such a situation to be unfair to sentence by complying with the more severe State regime under s 44, where the statutory ratio is 75 per cent, rather than by adopting the practice for determining the non-parole period for Commonwealth offences, where the ratio is 60 to 66 per cent. 
     
      
    39 In any event it does not seem that her Honour addressed the difficulty caused by the two types of offences carrying with it two different sentencing regimes so that she made a conscious decision to apply one rather than the other and giving reasons for that choice. Frankly had her Honour done so, I cannot see how she would, in all of the circumstances of this case, been able to justify applying the State regime. It was not a case where, in applying the Commonwealth practice, a non-parole period of 75 per cent of the head sentence could be justified. 
     
      
    40 It seems to me that it is appropriate to restructure the sentences and slightly reduce the overall non-parole period to deal with the problem of the mixed offences. I wish to make it clear that in this case it is appropriate to apply the Commonwealth practice so far as the overall non-parole period is concerned but it will not always be the case just because the overall sentence being imposed is for both State and Commonwealth offences. 
     
      
    41 I propose that the appeal be allowed and the following orders made: 
     
      
       
        
        The sentences are quashed and in lieu the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
         
         
        1. On the first count and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 a fixed term of 2 years to date from 6 May 2005 and to expire on 5 May 2007. 
         
         
        2. On the second count a sentence of 1 year to date from 6 November 2005 and to expire on 5 November 2006. 
         
         
        3. On the third count and taking into account the additional matters a sentence of 3 years to date from 6 May 2006. 
         
         
        4. In relation to the second and third counts there is to be a non-parole period of 2 years 2 months to commence on 6 November 2005 and to expire on 5 January 2008. 
        
       
      
    42 PRICE J: I have read in draft form the reasons of Howie J. I agree with those reasons and with the orders proposed.

    JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: As to the sentencing of Karl Suleman.1 The offender is Karl Suleman. He was born in Baghdad, Iraq, on 16 April 1961. He committed the offences, for which I am to impose sentences upon him, between April 2000 and July 2001. Accordingly, he was aged between thirty-nine years and forty years three months when he committed the offences and he is aged forty five years nine months now.2 The offender is the only child of his parents. His father was a pilot in the Iraqi Air Force. Unfortunately, his father died during 1963 when his aircraft crashed while he was on active service. The offender does not have any memory of his father. He was raised by his mother.3 The offender’s mother migrated to Australia during 1976, bringing the offender with her. He has lived in Australia since 1976. He is, so far as I am aware, a naturalised Australian citizen.4 The offender attended primary and secondary schools in Iraq before leaving there to come to Australia and he attended Fairfield Boys High School after arriving in Australia. He completed Year 11 at high school. He did not obtain the Higher School Certificate.5 After leaving school, the offender obtained employment as a factory hand, which employment he had until 1985 when he injured his back in the course of his employment. As well as this employment, he pursued a musical career, albeit part time, as a drummer, achieving some success until closing this career during 1989.6 During 1988 the offender married. He and his wife are the parents of two children, a daughter aged fourteen years and a son aged eleven years. He is, so far as I am aware, estranged from his wife. His children live with his wife. He has minimal contact with his children.7 During 1989 the offender purchased, either alone or in partnership, and I do not know which, a 7-Eleven convenience store. As he was successful in managing this store, he purchased another store and he was successful in managing both stores. He sold his interest in these stores during 1992. 8 During 1993, after selling his interest in the 7-Eleven stores, the offender established a business collecting trolleys, which had been used by supermarket customers to transport groceries and such like from the supermarket to their cars, from where the trolleys had been left by customers. He was successful in this business. However, ultimately, his view of his success in this business led to his downfall.9 In December 1999 the offender incorporated Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. This company took over the operation of the offender’s trolley collection business. This company had an issued share capital of $2, with the offender and his wife each holding one $1 share. The offender was the company’s only director.10 From at least April 2000 until at least July 2001 the offender accepted investments, as he called them, from the public, particularly members of the Assyrian community, in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. An investor's investment in the trolley collection business was to be evidenced by a document called a “Financial Investment Agreement”. In the agreement, Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited was called ""the manager"", the trolley collection business was called ""the business"" and the investor was called ""the investor"". The agreement was to be for a period of years, which period varied between three and fifteen years. By the agreement, Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited was to pay to the investor a guaranteed amount of money every fortnight from the income of the trolley collection business for the duration of the agreement.11 On 10 April 2000 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Soldoz Pty Limited entered into an investment agreement whereby Soldoz Pty Limited invested $140,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited with Franklins at Beenleigh and Biggera Waters in Queensland and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Soldoz Pty Limited $4,100 per fortnight from the income of the business at those places for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. However, Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited did not have any agreement with Franklins for collection of its trolleys at Beenleigh or Biggera Waters. Nonetheless, between 10 April 2000 and 12 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made thirty six fortnightly payments of $4,100, amounting to $147,000, to Soldoz Pty Limited, with the result that it did not lose any of its investment. This investment resulted in count 1 of the indictment.12 On 14 April 2000 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Billington Family Trust, trading as Cedar House Alpaca Stud, entered into an investment agreement whereby Billington Family Trust invested $1,000,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited with various supermarkets in places in both Queensland and New South Wales and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Billington Family Trust $25,000 per fortnight from the income of the businesses at those places for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. However, Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited did not have any agreement with those supermarkets for collection of their trolleys at those places. Nonetheless, between 10 April 2000 and 20 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made forty four fortnightly payments of $25,000, amounting to $1,100,000, to Billington Family Trust, with the result that the trust did not lose any of its investment. This investment resulted in count 2 of the indictment.13 In order to induce Billington Family Trust to enter into the said investment agreement, and thereby to invest $1,000,000, the offender, on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited, provided Billington Family Trust with documents purporting to be agreements between Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and the named supermarkets for the collection of their trolleys at the specified places. These documents were false. These documents were created by the offender. These documents resulted in counts 16 to 26 of the indictment.14 On 30 April 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mr Terrence Smith entered into an investment agreement where by Mr Smith invested $100,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Mr Smith $5,000 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 30 April 2001 and 12 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made fourteen fortnightly payments of $5,000, amounting to $70,000, to Mr Smith, with the result that Mr Smith lost $30,000 on his investment. This investment resulted in count 3 of the indictment.15 On 30 April 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mr Charles Howil and Ms Simira Youkhana entered into an investment agreement whereby Mr Howil and Ms Youkhana invested $100,000 each in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Mr Howil and to Ms Youkhana $10,000 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 11 May 2001 and 12 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made fourteen fortnightly payments of $5,000, amounting to $70,000, to each of Mr Howil and Ms Youkhana, with the result that each of them lost $30,000 on their investment. This investment resulted in count 4 of the indictment.16 On 10 March 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mr Andrew Rohan entered into an investment agreement whereby Mr Rohan invested $150,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Mr Rohan $4,500 per fortnight from the income of the business for five years. However, during May 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mr Rohan entered into another agreement whereby Mr Rohan increased his investment to $200,000 and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Mr Rohan $12,000 per fortnight for ten years. Between 23 March 2001 and 18 May 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made five fortnightly payments of $4,500 and between 16 May 2001 and 11 November 2001 it made eleven fortnightly payments of $12,000, amounting to $154,500, to Mr Rohan, with the result that Mr Rohan lost $55,500 on his investment. This investment resulted in count 5 of the indictment.17 On 14 May 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Pace Partners Pty Limited entered into an investment agreement whereby Pace Partners Pty Limited invested $500,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Pace Partners Pty Limited $25,000 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 30 May 2001 and 11 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made thirteen fortnightly payments of $25,000, amounting to $325,000, to Pace Partners Pty Limited. Subsequently, the liquidator of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited paid $4,375 to Pace Partners Pty Limited. Accordingly, Pace Partners Pty Limited lost $170,625 on its investment. This investment resulted in count 6 of the indictment.18 On 4 June 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mr Norair Sarkez entered into an investment agreement whereby Mr Sarkez invested $100,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Mr Sarkez $5,200 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 15 June 2001 and 6 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made eleven fortnightly payments of $5,200, amounting to $57,200, to Mr Sarkez. Subsequently the liquidator of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited paid $1,070 to Mr Sarkez. Accordingly, Mr Sarkez lost $41,730 on his investment. This investment resulted in count 7 of the indictment.19 On 5 June 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mr and Mrs Madlen and Sargon Rashed entered into an investment agreement whereby they invested $100,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to them $5,000 per fortnight from the income of the business. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 15 June 2001 and 6 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made eleven fortnightly payments of $5,000, amounting to $55,000, to Mr and Mrs Rashed. Subsequently the liquidator of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited paid $1,125 to the Rasheds. Accordingly, the Rasheds lost $43,875 on their investment. This investment resulted in count 8 of the indictment.20 On 25 June 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mr and Mrs Trudy and Robert Zanella entered into an investment agreement whereby Mr and Mrs Zanella invested $100,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Mr and Mrs Zanella $4,000 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 6 July and 12 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made ten fortnightly payments of $4,000, amounting to $40,000, to Mr and Mrs Zanella. Subsequently, the liquidator of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited paid $2,000 to Mr and Mrs Zanella. Accordingly, Mr and Mrs Zanella lost $58,000 on their investment. This investment resulted in count 9 of the indictment.21 On 25 June 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mr and Mrs Kathleen and Ashoor Isaac entered into an investment agreement whereby Mr and Mrs Isaac invested $200,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Mr and Mrs Isaac $10,000 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 6 July 2001 and 12 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made ten fortnightly payments of $10,000, amounting to $100,000, to Mr and Mrs Isaac. Subsequently, the liquidator of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited paid $2,500 to Mr and Mrs Isaac. Accordingly, Mr and Mrs Isaac lost $97,500 on their investment. This investment resulted in count 10 of the indictment.22 On 25 June 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mr Sahar Miraziz entered into an investment agreement whereby Mr Miraziz invested $142,000, although the amount stated in the agreement is $150,000, in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Mr Miraziz $8,250 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 6 July 2001 and 22 October 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made nine fortnightly payments, varying between $8,250 and $9,200, amounting in all to $78,300, to Mr Miraziz. Accordingly, Mr Miraziz lost $78,300 on his investment. This investment resulted in count 11 of the indictment.23 On 3 July 3001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Ms Waijo Kaia entered into an investment agreement whereby Ms Kaia invested $100,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Ms Kaia $5,000 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 27 July 2001 and 5 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made eight fortnightly payments of $5,000, amounting to $40,000, to Ms Kaia. Accordingly, Miss Kaia lost $60,000 on her investment. This investment resulted in count 12 of the indictment.24 On 9 July 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Zax Office Services Pty Limited entered into an investment agreement whereby Zax Office Services Pty Limited invested $100,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Zax Office Services Pty. Limited $8,000 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 20 July 2001 and 12 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made nine fortnightly payments of $8,000, amounting to $72,000, to Zax Office Services Pty Limited, with the result that Zax Office Services Pty Limited lost $28,000 on its investment. This investment resulted in count 13 of the indictment.25 On 13 July 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mr Fred Miraziz entered into an investment agreement where by Mr Miraziz invested $95,000, although the amount stated in the agreement is an amount of $100,000, in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Mr Miraziz $5,500 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 30 July 2001 and 6 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made eight fortnightly payments of $5,500, amounting to $44,000, to Mr Miraziz. Subsequently, the liquidator of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited paid $1,275 to Mr Miraziz. Accordingly, Mr Miraziz lost $49,725 on his investment. This investment resulted in count 14 of the indictment.26 On 13 July 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Mighty Motors Pty Limited entered into an investment agreement whereby Mighty Motors Pty Limited invested $100,000 in the trolley collection business operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited agreed to pay to Mighty Motors Pty Limited $5,300 per fortnight from the income of the business for the duration of the agreement. The offender signed the agreement on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Between 27 July 2001 and 6 November 2001 Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited made eight fortnightly payments of $5,300, totalling $42,400, to Mighty Motors Pty. Limited. Subsequently, the liquidator of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited paid $1,440 to Mighty Motors Pty Limited. Accordingly, Mighty Motors Pty Limited lost $56,160 on its investment. This investment resulted in count 15 of the indictment.27 In the result between April 2000 and July 2001 the fifteen investors invested a total of $3,185,000 in Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Of these investors, two of them did not lose any of their investment and the other thirteen of them lost a total of $828,915. 28 I do not have any doubt that the offender knew, at the times when he signed the agreements on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited, that the income being generated by the trolley collection business being operated by Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited was insufficient to meet the payments guaranteed by the agreements. Also, I do not have any doubt that the offender knew, when he arranged for the various documents to be provided to the Billington Family Trust, that the documents were false, because he had himself created those documents.29 Towards the end of July 2001 the offender engaged Mr Terrence Griffiths as a management consultant to advise him on his proposed float of a group of companies associated with him. This group of companies was known as the Froggy Group. The offender hoped that the float of the Froggy Group of companies would raise sufficient funds to allow him to repay the investors in Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. The involvement of Mr Griffiths with the offender is detailed in Mr Griffiths’ statement 10 April 2000 and his evidence given on 30 November 2006. The involvement of Mr Griffiths with the offender came to an end on 5 October 2001.30 I do not see the evidence of Mr Griffiths to be particularly relevant or particularly helpful. The offender had committed the subject offences, except perhaps the last of them, before he engaged Mr Griffiths to advise him on his proposed float of the Froggy Group of companies and, therefore, I consider that his hope, in so far as the investors in Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited was concerned, does not exculpate or absolve him from his criminal responsibility for those offences. Although Mr Griffiths thought that the offender was an engaging, intelligent, popular, street smart but naïve man who relied on the advice of others, I consider that it is obvious that the offender knew, at the time that he signed the various investments agreements on behalf of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited, that the income being generated by the trolley collection business was significantly insufficient to pay the guaranteed amounts to the investors.31 On 12 November 2001 Mr Neil Cussen and Mr Paul Weston were appointed joint administrators of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and on 7 December 2001 they were appointed joint liquidators of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited.32 On 16 May 2002 the liquidators published their report to the creditors of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. This report covered the period from 1 July 2000 to 31 March 2002. During this period, the trolley collection business of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited generated a total gross income of $5,941,763, which produced a total net profit of $275,096. This total net profit resulted in an average net fortnightly profit of $7,750. However, Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited had agreed to pay a total of $137,350 per fortnight to the fifteen investors referred to above. It is obvious, as I said during submissions as to sentence, that the offender was using the money that he had obtained from later investors to pay the guaranteed payments to earlier investors.33 On 15 April 2004 the offender was dealt with by a judge of this court for one offence committed during December 2000 of using an instrument known to be false to induce a person to accept the instrument as genuine and to do some act to that person’s prejudice, contrary to s 300 subs (2) of the Crimes Act, and for three offences, one committed during March 2001 and the others committed during October 2001, of making a statement known to be false in a material particular to obtain a financial advantage for himself, contrary to s 178BB subs (1) of the Crimes Act. The circumstance in which the offender committed the offences are set out in the judge’s reasons for sentence, exhibit C. The first offence related to the offender’s use of a false instrument, which he himself had created, to obtain a loan of $335,000 to purchase a Ferrari Spyder car. The second offence related to the offender’s false statement on an application to borrow $2,300,000 to purchase a motor yacht for $3,300,000. The third and fourth offences related to the offender’s statements on applications to borrow $250,000 to purchase a Ferrari Modena sports car. The offender was sentenced to imprisonment for an overall period of one year nine months, with a non-parole period of twelve months from 5 March 2004 to 4 March 2005 and a parole period of nine months from 5 March 2005 to 4 December 2005. He was released from prison, so far as I am aware, on 4 March 2005.34 On 24 September 2004 the offender was interviewed by police about the investments by the fifteen investors in Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited. Some of the offender’s answers to questions asked of him are recorded in the statement of agreed facts, exhibit A. In some of his answers, the offender accused his solicitor of, at best, poor advice or, at worst, complicity in the offences. As I said during submissions as to sentence, I am not prepared to accept the offender’s accusations against his former solicitor without his former solicitor being given the opportunity to answer those accusations.35 On 2 February 2005 police filed twenty-six Court Attendance Notices, one for each of the subject offences, in the Central Sydney Local Court for the attendance of the offender before that court on 2 March 2005 to answer the charges. The Court Attendance Notices were served on the offender on 3 February 2005.36 In due course, on 26 July 2005 the offender appeared before a magistrate in the Central Sydney Local Court, he having agreed to dispense with a committal hearing, and he was committed to appear in this court on 12 August 2005 for arraignment with the charges.37 Accordingly, in due course, on 1 May 2006 the offender appeared in this court for arraignment with the charges. On being arraigned, he pleaded guilty to each of the twenty-six offences. He was remanded in custody, bail not being applied for, to a later date for sentencing. I consider that the offender is entitled to a discount in sentence of fifteen per cent on account of his guilty pleas, those pleas not having been given at an earlier point of time.38 In due course, on 30 November 2006 the offender appeared before me on the sentencing proceedings. Over two days I received documentary material from the Crown Prosecutor and the offender’s counsel and I heard evidence from Mr Weston, one of the joint liquidators of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited, called by the Crown prosecutor and Mr Griffiths called by the offender’s counsel and submissions as to sentence from the Crown Prosecutor and the offender’s counsel, after which I stood over the sentencing of the offender to today.39 I am now to impose sentences upon the offender for each of the subject offences.40 The offences referred to in counts 1 to 15 inclusive of the indictment are offences of making a statement known to be false in a material particular to obtain money for Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited, contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act, for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of five years when dealt with on indictment or imprisonment for a maximum of two years if dealt with summarily.41 The offences referred to in counts 16 to 26 inclusive of the indictment are offences of using an instrument known to be false to induce a person to accept the instrument as genuine and to do some act to that person’s prejudice, contrary to s 300 subs (2) of the Crimes Act, for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of ten years when dealt with on indictment or imprisonment for a maximum of two years if dealt with summarily.42 The offences committed by the offender are beyond argument serious offences. They are offences that may be described by the term “white collar crime”. However, to so describe the offences does not reduce the seriousness of them or the offender’s criminal responsibility for them. They were deliberate and planned offences, particularly the offences related to the Billington Family Trust. They, other than those related to the Billington Family Trust, were committed upon commercially naïve people. They involved a breach of trust that the investors, particularly those within the Assyrian community, had in the offender. They were committed without regard to the obvious likelihood that the later investors would lose some, if not all, of their money. They resulted in all but two of the investors losing money. They were committed by the offender to obtain money so that he could live a lifestyle far beyond his legitimate income, thereby increasing, at least in his own mind, his popularity and standing in the community generally and in the Assyrian community particularly.43 The offender’s counsel submitted that the offender’s criminal responsibility for the offences was reduced by his intention to repay the investments to the investors from whatever he received from the float of the Froggy Group of companies. I do not agree. I cannot see anything in the evidence to show that before, at latest, April 2000 the offender had obtained any appropriate advice from any competent person as to the value of the Froggy Group of companies. Moreover, I do not overlook the obvious. The investors were offered investment in Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited, not one or other of the companies in the Froggy Group. I consider that it is obvious that the offender used Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited as a cash cow to fund his lifestyle and the public profile of the Froggy Group of companies. As it transpired, the Froggy Group of companies owed about $8,000,000 to Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited at the time of liquidation of the Froggy Group of companies.44 The offender’s counsel submitted also that the offender’s criminal responsibility for the offences was reduced by his reliance on the advice given him by others such as his accountant and his solicitor. I do not agree. I cannot see anything in the evidence to show that the offender relied in his dealings with the various investors on the advice given to him by anybody about anything. I do not doubt that he spoke to other people about what he was doing, but the evidence does not show that he was given any advice by any of those people. In any event, and notwithstanding the view of Mr Griffiths, I doubt that the offender would have accepted anyone’s advice about anything if he did not agree with that advice.45 The offender’s counsel submitted that the delay between the offender’s commission of the offences and his being charged with them is a mitigating factor. I accept that there had been some delay between May 2002 when the liquidators published their report to creditors of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and, firstly, 24 September 2004 when the police interviewed the offender about the offences and, later, 3 May 2005 when the offender was served with the Court Attendance Notices related to the offences. However I do not see the delay between the publication of the liquidators' report to creditors and the charging of the offender with the offences as unusual or inordinate. The full extent of the offender’s criminality did not become known until the liquidators had completed their investigation into the affairs of Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and the need for a faster investigation by police did not exist as the offender was serving a sentence of imprisonment between 5 March 2004 and 4 March 2005.46 In determining appropriate sentences to impose upon the offender for the subject offences, I must recognise the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I must take into account such of the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A subs (2) of the Act as are present and such of the mitigating factors referred to in subs (3) of that section as are present and any other relevant factor.47 I consider that, having regard to what I have said about the offences and the offender, the aggravating factors are those lettered (g) because, in relation to counts 3 to 15 inclusive, the amounts of money lost by the investigators was in each case substantial, (k) because of the offender’s breach of trust and (n) because the offences were deliberate and planned offences, and that the mitigating factors are those lettered (i) because the offender’s guilty pleas show his remorse and (k) because of his guilty pleas.48 As to the prospects for the offender’s rehabilitation and the likelihood of his not re-offending, the evidence is silent. I do not know what the offender did between 4 March 2005, when he was released from prison after serving the sentences imposed upon him on 15 April 2004, and 1 May 2006, when on arraignment he pleaded guilty to the subject offences, after which he was committed to prison pending sentencing. I do not know what support if any he will have available to him on his release from prison. However, I know that all his offending occurred between April 2000 and October 2001 and related to his involvement in Karl Suleman Enterprises Pty Limited and the Froggy Group of companies. Also, I know that he has been declared bankrupt. Therefore, as I doubt that he will ever again be in a position to obtain money from anybody, I suppose that there is a reasonable prospect for his rehabilitation and a reasonable likelihood that he will not re-offend.49 One factor not mentioned in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is deterrence. Although I see personal deterrence to be of less importance in this case than it might be in another case, because I doubt that the offender will re-offend, or at least there is a reasonable prospect that he will not re-offend, I see general deterrence to be important, something that cannot be ignored or under-valued, because offences of the kind committed by the offender are difficult to detect, costly and time consuming to investigate and often result in significant financial loss to members of the public.50 What, then, having regard to what I have said a bout the offences and the offender are appropriate sentences to impose upon the offender for those offences?51 I have determined, balancing the purposes of sentencing, the objective features of the offences, the subjective features of the offender and the aggravating and mitigating factors, to all of which I have referred, that for the offences contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act, those referred to in counts 1 to 15 of the indictment, the starting point is imprisonment for three years six months, and for the offences contrary to s 300 subs (2) of the Crimes Act, those referred to in counts 16 to 26 of the indictment, the starting point, because those offences were used in conjunction with the offence referred to in count 2 of the indictment, is imprisonment for three years. I reduce the period of three years six months by fifteen per cent, which, for ease of calculation, is seven months, to two years eleven months, and the period of three years by fifteen per cent, which, again for ease of calculation, is six months, to two years six months. Absent a special circumstance, a sentence of imprisonment for two years eleven months would be divided into a non parole period of two years two months seven days and a parole period of eight months twenty one days, and a sentence of imprisonment for two years six months would be divided into a non parole period of one year ten months fourteen days and a parole period of seven months fourteen days.52 As to special circumstances, the offender’s counsel submitted that the offender’s state of mental health, as revealed by the report of Dr Whitten, exhibit 2, and the report of Dr Westmore, exhibit 3, although Dr Whitten’s report is somewhat dated, is a special circumstance which warranted a variation in the otherwise statutory ratio between the non parole period and the parole period of the sentence. Although I accept that the offender is, not unexpectedly, depressed by the situation into which he has put himself, I do not see his depression as a special circumstance, as there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that his depression will make prison life more onerous than it should be.53 As to whether the sentences should be served concurrently or consecutively or partly concurrently and partly consecutively, I consider that, as the offences were separate and distinct offences, although the offences referred to in counts 16 to 26 are related to the offence referred to in count 2 of the indictment, the sentences for the offences contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act, those referred to in counts 1 to 15 inclusive of the indictment, should be served partly concurrently and partly consecutively, and that the sentences for the offences contrary to s 300 subs (2) of the Crimes Act, those referred to in counts 16 to 26 of the indictment, should be served concurrently with each other and partly consecutively with the other sentences. However, in view of what I will say as to totality, this result cannot be achieved.54 As to totality, I consider that to reflect the offender’s criminality for the twenty-six offences, and to punish him properly for those offences, the offender should serve a total sentence of seven years four months with a total non parole period of five years six months and a parole period of one year ten months. To achieve this result, I propose to impose upon the offender sentences of imprisonment for a fixed period in relation to counts 1 to 14 inclusive and counts 16 to 26 inclusive of the indictment, and for a period divided into a non parole period and a parole period in relation to count 15 of the indictment. For ease of division of the overall non parole period of five years six months among the offences, the actual sentences that I will impose upon the offender in relation to counts 1 to 14 inclusive and 16 to 26 inclusive of the indictment will be less than the periods calculated in para 51 above.55 Accordingly, Karl Suleman, for each of the twenty-six offences to which you have pleaded that you are guilty, you are convicted. I sentence you as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 May 2006 to 31 October 2007.

      Counts 16 to 26 inclusive. Imprisonment for nine months from 1 May 2006 to 31 January 2007. 
      
     
     
      
      Count 3. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 August 2006 to 31 January 2008. 
      
     
     
      
      Count 4. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 August 2006 to 31 January 2008.

      Count 6. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 November 2007 to 30 April 2009. 
      
     
     
      
      Count 7. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 February 2008 to 31 July 2009. 
      
     
     
      
      Count 8. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 February 2008 to 31 July 2009. 
      
     
     
      
      Count 9. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 February 2008 to 31 July 2009.

      Count 11. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 May 2008 to 31 October 2009. 
      
     
     
      
      Count 12. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 August 2009 to 31 January 2011. 
      
     
     
      
      Count 13. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 August 2009 to 31 January 2011. 
      
     
     
      
      Count 14. Imprisonment for one year six months from 1 February 2010 to 31 July 2011. 
      
     
     
      
      Count 15. Imprisonment for a total period of two years two months fourteen days with a non parole period of four months fourteen days from 18 June 2011 to 31 October 2011, on which date you are to be eligible to be released on parole, and a parole period of one year ten months from 1 November 2011 to 31 August 2013. 
      
    56 I order that you be subject to supervision by the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service whilst on parole during the parole period.

   JUDGMENTHis Honour: This sentence will take probably more than an hour and a half to read. It is necessary for these things to be said so that the courts understand, and hopefully you will understand why these sentences are being passed.Section 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 applies to these proceedings and the name of each accused is not to be published, nor is anything to be published which would disclose their identity. Section 291 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 also applies to these proceedings. The name of the complainant is not to be published, nor is anything to be published which would disclosed her identity. Likewise the name of the complainant’s son is not to be published, nor is anything to be published which would disclose his identity.Remarks on Sentence1 Attitudes vary among the community as to what, of a very wide range of activities and ambience, is an acceptable expression of sexual interest by one party towards another. Usually the law does not seek to enter the bedroom of law abiding citizens no matter what their sexual proclivities may be. Fundamental to this tolerance is that any sexual activity must be consensual. Where consent of a party, invariably the weaker party, is absent then even a touch of another by an offender pursuing, or claiming to pursue a sexual interest becomes criminal conduct.2 Shortly after 8pm on 6 March 2005 two young teenage males unlawfully entered the home of a mother alone with her five year old son. During their stay these two youths robbed her at gunpoint. Worse, however, was to follow. On ten occasions she was brutally, sexually assaulted by one or other of the young persons whilst that offender was in the company of the other.3 Each presented as being driven by a lust, insatiable unless the victim was degraded, humiliated, terrified and experienced the unbridled lawlessness of power that comes from the point of a gun.4 Each youth today is to be held accountable for his part in this wanton conduct that left behind a traumatic and scarred victim.5 On 29 May 2006, when this matter was set down for a separate trial I. D. pleaded guilty to three counts in an indictment alleging eleven criminal offences by him whilst in the complainant’s unit on 6 March 2005. The counts to which he pleaded guilty were (1) robbery in company whilst armed with an offensive weapon and then breaking out of the complainant’s premises; (2), at a time when he was in the company of his co-offender he had sexual intercourse (fellatio) with the complainant without her consent knowing that she was not consenting and immediately before that sexual intercourse threatened to inflict actual bodily harm upon her and her son by means of an offensive weapon; (3) the third count was in the same terms, but related to a different act of fellatio in circumstances significantly different, to which I shall come shortly.6 The Crown accepted these three pleas of guilty in full satisfaction of that indictment. The Crown also sought to record that even though the plea came on the day of the trial, the complainant felt relieved at not having to go through the ordeal of being cross-examined. 7 O. N. pleaded guilty at the Local Court to all eleven charges, now contained on an indictment, separate from the other offender’s. Although each alleged offence on the indictment was expressed in identical terms, the conduct covered by each charge differs. 8 The charges are, each phrased that at a time when he was in the company of his co-offender, he had sexual intercourse without consent of the complainant and immediately before the sexual intercourse threatened to inflict actual bodily harm upon her by means of an offensive weapon. He asks that when I sentence him for count eleven, the most serious count in the indictment, that I take into account pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 a break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely, threaten complainant while in the company of another. That offence is said to have occurred on 6 March 2005; and that I further take into account on another Form 1 an attempted armed robbery of a pizza delivery man that occurred on 2 April 2005. The break and enter and commit serious indictable offence is the break and enter which is said to have occurred at the complainant’s premises.9 As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for each of these offences before this Court committed by this offender, harming, in particular, this victim in this community (see The Queen v Gladue [1999] 1 SCR 688 at [80]). 10 My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to each offender, subjective matters they are called. The starting point for such assessment requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offences and to each offender.11 My fact finding task in this case has been circumscribed, in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts for each accused, to which I shall shortly return.12 It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court a judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of agreed facts does not relieve him or her from the fact finding responsibility of a judge, it simply limits the material from which the facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred it must be remembered that the Court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it.13 An agreed statement of facts was also tendered by the Crown in its case against O. N. Nor is the Court involved, of course, when it comes to agreed statement of facts, in policy or bargaining’s considerations that may have led to such tender of evidence. The Court’s task is simply to find the facts on the evidence presented. 14 Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to, firstly, what jurisdiction ought to be engaged in respect of the first count to which I. D. pleaded; secondly, deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, parity, totality, how the Form 1 matters will impact upon the sentence, whether (as they do) any of these offences attract a standard non parole period and if so the lengths of the parole periods. Finally, of course, the ultimate sentence that is to be imposed.15 I will also need to have regard to the relevant provisions of s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and relevant case law when dealing with young persons who have breached the criminal law in circumstances such as these young men. 16 There is a victim impact statement that has been tendered. I will need to place it in context in these proceedings.17 What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative, that all sentencing should have as its primary focus, including the sentencing of children, the protection of the community will need to be determined (see R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329; Rushby v the Queen [1977] 1 NSWLR 594; and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740). 18 In the case of I. D. the facts document was tendered upon the basis that it contained allegations of fact made by the Crown and that Mr White, counsel for I. D., would indicate he disputed nothing contained in the document. Mr White sought, though, some limitation of the effect of the facts upon the criminality of his client. I will return later to some of Mr White’s submissions and approach. Facts19 J.B., the complainant, a Fijian national, aged forty and her five year old son lived together at a unit in Ernest Street, Lakemba. The unit was situated on what was said to be the second floor. There were two balconies; one off the bedroom, that faced towards the street. The other balcony was situated at the end of the unit, located near the front door and presumably off the living area of the unit. I have assumed it was facing towards the driveway.20 March 6 was a Sunday night. The complainant was at home, dressed in track suit pants, underwear and nightie. She was watching a DVD movie in her lounge room. Her young son was asleep on the lounge. Shortly after 8pm the two youths gained access to the second floor balcony. It would seem they did so by use of Otto bins. The floor of the balcony is in excess of 3.6 metres from the driveway or garden surface. If they did not use the wheelie bins I am unable to determine how they reached the balcony, but there is evidence suggesting that that was how it was done.21 In the two or so hours preceding their reaching the balcony the two youths had been at a park named Wiley Park. That park is to be found at the intersection of King Georges and Canterbury Roads. Ernest Street appears to be one block east of the park. I. D. gives evidence that he consumed half a bottle of Jim Beam, two grams of cannabis from a bong he apparently had with him and an ecstasy tablet in that two hours.22 His evidence is that he was intoxicated to a point where his head was not straight, he was unaware of things around him and his eyesight was a bit blurry, that it really affected him mental wise for his thinking. 23 However, his evidence is his motivation for the offence was to obtain money for drugs because he was coming down off drugs (transcript 8/9/06 p 34).24 O. N. at the time of the offence told Juvenile Justice he was not under the influence of alcohol (Juvenile Justice report 14/6/06 p 6). He did, he said, however, consume a third of a bottle of Jim Beam and smoke one or two sticks of cannabis.25 There are a number of reasons to reject I. D.’s self-serving statements of inebriation to the level he claimed at the time of his offending conduct. I hasten to note I do not reject that he had been drinking Jim Beam or smoking cannabis. It is the level of inebriation that is in question.26 He accepts in cross-examination he was able to gain entry into the unit with little trouble. He was quick to cover his face when he recognised someone was present as he entered the lounge room, suggesting a capacity to respond quickly and appropriately to a perceived risk of being identified.27 The complainant, in her victim impact statement, makes reference to a mask. There is nothing in the agreed facts consistent with a mask other than the T-shirts. I simply note that I have difficulty in resolving that problem. 28 There is no recorded observation in the evidence from the victim, nor concession in the crown case that either youth appeared to be inebriated to the extent I. D. claimed or at all. The absence of such an observation is consistent with them being present and in apparent possession of their faculties. 29 I accept there probably was some consumption of drugs and/or alcohol. But, the defence has failed to establish that I. D.’s consumption had any significant effect upon his level of awareness, his capacity to determine independently his level of participation in the events whilst inside the premises, or his capacity to perform any or all of the acts he desired to perform.30 Upon gaining entry, but before entering the lounge room, both youths covered their faces with T-shirts. It is likely the youths heard the sound of the TV and assumed people were home. That they continued with their criminal enterprise is of concern. I. D. claims to have seen J.B. from the bedroom. No diagram of the unit has been tendered, but I do know that the unit is one of at least two bedrooms, the main bedroom and the son’s. I know it has a bathroom. It is likely therefore that there is a hallway leading from the lounge or living area to the bathroom. It is likely the bedroom doors open onto that hallway at right angles. See exhibit J.31 If so, and they were deep inside the bedroom, it is not likely I. D. would have seen anybody in the living area. I am not satisfied J.B. had been seen before the youths left the bedroom. Nor is there any evidence, other than their willingness to enter the lounge room, that they knew for certain that it was relatively safe for them to do so, although of course they had the weapon.32 The fact is I cannot be satisfied they targeted these premises, or knew they were entering into the bedroom of premises where there was only a female and her son at home. Nor can I be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that they went in totally blind. From the bedroom they must have heard the DVD dialogue or music or both alerting them to the probability of a viewer or viewers, but it is difficult to see from the bedroom that they could have been satisfied for instance that no male was present, or that they in turn were not the ones that were outnumbered.33 Their entry time was at 8pm. Neither has any reason to believe the premises were deserted other than claimed darkness of the bedroom. At 8pm on a Sunday night most people are in their homes. There was a second balcony; there was a driveway. Lights or reflections from the TV may well have been visible. Noise from the TV may well have been audible. It surely is likely that one or both youths checked down the driveway to see if any better access could be gained from that balcony. Indeed O. N.’s evidence is that the front screen door of the bedroom balcony was open. As I say, he does say there were no lights, but the TV of course was on and light reflection of varying colours would have come from it. The presence or potential presence of an adult male would likely have deterred them, yet they did not appear to be deterred. O. N.’s evidence is that once inside the unit there was light visible from the lounge room. It is at this point he says that they put their T-shirts over their faces.34 I only review that evidence to show why it is that I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that they knew no one was home. 35 As evidence stands neither side has satisfied me on the relevant onus of aggravating or mitigating feature so far as awareness by the offenders of the presence or otherwise of people in the unit.36 J.B. was shocked to see the male figures with faces hidden by T-shirts. She shouted and screamed. She noticed one, O. N., was holding a small black pistol in his hand. Having read the complainant’s victim impact statement I am satisfied the child did not wake, notwithstanding the screaming of the complainant and no doubt the commands of “Shut up, shut up” called out by O. N. He aimed his weapon at the five-year-old’s head saying, “I swear I pull the trigger if you make a sound”. O. N.’s evidence was he had been given the weapon by I. D. when they entered the unit, meaning as I understand it, outside the unit, but when they were about to enter the unit. I accept that that is likely to have occurred because there was no cross-examination of him on that evidence. 37 There was nothing in the demeanour of either youth to suggest that they did not mean what was being said to the victim. It is at this point that complete power over the situation was their’s. Thereafter each could do as he willed. Each took advantage of that situation. 38 O. N. demanded the jewellery she was wearing. Scared she complied, removing necklaces and handing them to him. She was forced into the bedroom by O. N. where further jewellery and some cash were taken from her. 39 I. D. was also present in the bedroom ransacking her wardrobe, looking for and removing items including a purse containing $10. More money was demanded. She denied having any more money present. I. D.’s response was, “She’s telling lies, shoot her, shoot her”. Such a response was bound to cause terror in his victim. I. D.’s search of the wardrobe was resumed. He found a bank keycard. She was asked by I. D. whether there was any money in this account. There was none. He threw the card to the floor. I. D. found further jewellery located in various points in the bedroom. Eleven fine twenty-two carat bangles and a number of eighteen and nine carat rings with precious stones were included in items captured by I. D.40 The taking of all of that material constitutes the robbery allegation contained in the first count on the indictment against I. D. and constitutes the ingredients of the Form 1 matter against O. N.Sexual Assaults Committed.41 O. N. demanded J.B. sit on the edge of her bed and remove her clothing. She hesitated. “Do as you’re told and hurry up.” he said. She started with her nightie. O. N. grabbed the nightie and pulled it off. She was naked from the waste up. O. N. removed his own pants and underwear. His penis was semi-erect. “Do a mouth job.” he said. He grabbed the back of her head and forced her towards his penis, which he forced into her mouth without her consent. He became fully erect. This episode ended when she commenced to be sick. My own view is it is likely she gagged because it was thrust too deep down her throat.42 O. N.’s response was to push her back onto the bed. “Give me your pussy.” he demanded. Her tracksuit pants and underwear were pulled down to her knees, her legs were forced apart, he then penetrated her vagina without her consent with his penis. He sought to stimulate his penis by moving back and forth several times. He stopped. “No good, come to the room”. O. N. forced her into her son’s bedroom. There was a sofa bed in this room. He forced her onto this bed. He lay on his back ordering her to sit on his erect penis. Fearing she could be shot if she did not obey she sat astride O. N. who guided his penis into her vagina without her consent.43 I. D. entered the room. O. N. pushed her towards one side and left the room. I. D. forced her to fellate him. He put his penis into her mouth. That constitutes the fifth count on I. D.’s indictment. After a while he left the room, but O. N. returned. He then inserted his penis into her vagina. He left the room only to return after a short interval. He placed the pistol on the mattress. “Do the mouth job again.” he demanded. He forced her head yet again towards his penis. She was forced to fellate him.44 I. D. entered the room. O. N. already knew why. “We both want to do it together now.” he said. He lay on the bed forcing their victim to sit on him. Throughout the victim was fearful of being shot or at very least hurt if she did not comply. She was not consenting to this debauched treatment by them. She attempted to fellate I. D. but was unable because of the position each was in. Both offenders thereafter changed their position so that I. D. could achieve penetration of the complainant with his companion.45 His victim fellated him. She was not consenting. She was being penetrated into her vagina and did not consent to that either. After several minutes I. D. terminated the fellatio, walked from the room saying to his co-offender, “Hurry up”.46 This episode constitutes count number 10 in his indictment. O. N. continued with the unlawful intercourse upon which he was engaged. He stopped, dragged her through the unit, apparently looking for his co-offender. However, I. D. had left, breaking out through the front door. It is this breakout which constitutes the other part of the element of the indicted matter, count 1.47 O. N. went to the balcony, possibly the balcony from the living area, I do not know, and spoke to I. D. However he was not yet finished with his victim. She was taken to the bathroom, sat upon the toilet seat and told to do the mouth job. O. N. forced his penis into her mouth again without her consent. She was then made to stand up, face the mirror and lean forward. Her final indignity was to be penetrated anally by this youth she did not know and at a time when she was not consenting.48 In each case of sexual penetration of the complainant by one offender, that offender was in the company of his co-offender. As O. N. left the premises through the front door he said to his victim, “Do not contact the police, otherwise I will return and kill your son”. That threat had significance to the victim because ultimately when she contacted her sister who directed her to contact the police she was fearful of so doing. Ultimately that fear was put to one side, or overcome or ignored as the case may be and police were contacted.49 What went on in J.B.’s unit that night was not so much about sexual experience for these two young men, but rather the use of sex to satisfy a darker side of their personas. This was an exercise in humiliation related to culture, gender and their victim’s vulnerability or weakness.50 Earlier that night in the presence of I. D., O. N. had discovered J.B. may have been a Muslim. She was wearing a Muslim locket. He had taken the locket from the chain, threw it away saying, ""We hate Muslims."" While I have no doubt his co-offender did not know this outburst was to happen he did nothing to disavow it. Both young offenders come from families who appear to me to practice the Muslim faith. By their conduct each showed an absolute disrespect, if not contempt for a woman who was also a mother.51 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each offender when he penetrated the victim did so without using a condom. Mr White claimed the evidence did not permit me to make such a finding. He apparently had overlooked the victim impact statement. The victim spent three months worrying while tests were undertaken as to whether she had contracted AIDS or some other communicable disease. Further, there is no account of a condom being used, a detail I would have confidently expected both sides to bring into evidence if it were so. The absence of a condom would not necessarily be the subject of specific evidence but rather the norm, while the presence of a condom would I anticipate be the subject of specific evidence.52 When informed of the finding I was likely to make Mr White did not seek to re-open the evidence to lead positive evidence of the use of a condom by his client. A counsel of his experience would be well aware that that would have been a mitigating factor. The defence case is that neither youths went to these premises for any purpose connected with sex. It is unlikely in these circumstances that either, given their age, would be carrying a condom in his wallet.53 The pistol taken to the flat was an imitation pistol incapable of firing a projectile. I have recounted the facts more from the complainant’s perspective than from the perspective of the accused because the complainant did not know that the weapon that the youths had was not armed and was incapable of firing or killing her.54 The Form 1 matter against O. N. that I have not yet covered is that whilst in the company of two other juveniles he agreed to rob a pizza delivery man. An order was placed. Just before the pizza delivery driver arrived one of the three juveniles noticed police nearby. He informed the others and then left, two remained. Meanwhile the driver also arrived and asked O. N. whether he had ordered the pizzas. O. N. replied, ""No"", and began to walk off. The driver however saw a replica pistol, presumably the same replica pistol as used in the other offences, in O. N.’s hands. Whether he attracted the attention of the police or not, I know not, but it is the fact that police intervened immediately and arrested the offender. My understanding is he has been in custody since that arrest which occurred on 3 April 2005.55 The crown case for trial was capable of establishing the presence of each accused at the complainant’s premises via fingerprint evidence; that items stolen from her unit, and in particular her phone, were recovered in circumstances adverse to the accused. The complainant complained of the sexual assaults immediately to her sister and to police. Both offenders were positively identified by their victim in a photo array. There is every reason to think the crown case stood a reasonable chance of some success against both accused if not complete success.56 In the absence of a plea I. D. was exposed to eleven charges rather than the three to which he pleaded. These facts are limited to, and important when assessing the defence claim of contrition. They do not, of course, impact upon the utilitarian value of the pleas.Objective Criminality57 From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the object criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of each offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in what are called the instant cases, that is the cases in front of me, with criminality of offences of a similar kind committed by other people. It is in this way that the seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated or assessed by me. As you would imagine the objective criminality has an important aspect in the impact on the overall sentencing.58 A useful starting point in the assessment of objective criminality in sexual assault matters is to remind the Court of part of a judgment of one of the great appeal judges of Court of Appeal, Mahoney J. 
     
      
      As I have indicated every offence of this kind is a serious offence, but those whose duty it is to deal with crimes of this kind and to sentence those who commit them know that though each case is inherently serious some are more serious than others. In some cases the degree of violence, physical hurt inflicted, form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation and otherwise are much greater than are involved [in other cases]. It is to be understood that in sentencing it is appropriate - indeed in most cases it is necessary - that the sentencing judge form and record his assessment of where on the relevant scale of seriousness the particular offence lies.  
      R v Gebrail  
      NSW CCA 18-Nov 1994. 
      
    59 In 1993 the then Chief Justice, Gleeson CJ, made the point that non consensual intercourse is an extreme form of violence and one which the community expects courts to take very seriously, R v Hartikainen unreported, NSW CCA 8 June 1993; even if no additional violence is administered other than the intercourse, R v May (1938) 55 WN (NSW) 29. Unwanted forced intrusion into the privacy, indeed intimacy of a complainant’s body and psyche against her will, by use of physical power and callous disregard of her wishes or feelings, marks the essence of criminality for these offences. Such conduct is rightly described as antisocial, violent conduct of a high order.60 In this case the complainant was repeatedly assaulted, her intimacy repeatedly defiled. Each repetition must amount to greater criminality than the last. On one occasion both youths penetrated her simultaneously. The criminality of the particular conduct by each is aggravating by the circumstance of it also being joint conduct. Although the form of intercourse engaged by each was different I regard each as equally culpable in their criminality for that episode.61 Normally vaginal intercourse will be of greater criminality than acts of fellatio. Anal intercourse is of greater criminality than an act of vaginal intercourse, all other things being equal. Sometimes though, of course, it may be that circumstances will promote one of those forms of intercourse in its criminality than would otherwise be the norm. Anal intercourse of course is of greater criminality because it is yet a greater invasion of a complainant’s privacy.62 Mr White sought to argue a limitation on the criminality of I.D. in respect of the simultaneous penetration of the complainant because, it was said, I.D. was not in any way involved in a joint criminal enterprise in relation to the sexual acts committed by O N. Mr White sought to argue that at the point in time when both youths were simultaneously penetrating the complainant I. D. could not be punished for any role in O.N.’s penile vaginal penetration. He argued the law was I. D. could only be punished for the act of fellatio he was simultaneously committing, albeit that act of criminality was aggravated by the presence and actions of his co-offender.63 Unsavoury as it may be to analyse the law in circumstances such as this, surely the answer is to be found in O. N.’s announcement, without apparent consultation with I. D., when I. D. walked into the room. “We both want to do it together now.” The “it” was an act of joint penetration. There is nothing in the wording of the charge that restricts me from finding both men sought “sexual intercourse” without consent. That is, penetration of their victim in a sexual way by part of their respective bodies without consent. I reject Mr White’s submission that I am limited as he claimed.64 Any unwanted sexual intrusion may demean, belittle, humiliate and perhaps terrify an complainant, where, as in this case, the demeaning humiliation and terrifying is heightened the criminality will be aggravated. Each offender has been charged with committing the sexual assaults in the company of the other. That of course is an element of the offence with which I am dealing. It does not therefore constitute an additional aggravating component. 65 The commission of the sexual assault offences is in the complainant’s home and in circumstances where an unlawful purpose brought each offender into the home. Those circumstances amount to ingredients of aggravation.66 By the time the sexual offences occurred it was apparent to each offender that the complainant was vulnerable. Her vulnerability had as I see it four sources. She was in her home with no other adult present. She was outnumbered by both offenders. They were armed, and she was the carer of a five year old son. The offenders played upon each of her vulnerabilities. In so doing their criminality is aggravated, notwithstanding that aggravation for the weapon and company are elements of the offence. The presence of the offensive weapon is an ingredient of the offence and does not on its own amount to circumstances of aggravation. It is its repeated use to terrify that is the circumstance of aggravation.67 Ms Salsone submitted that I should find the presence of the gun was not for the purpose of committing sexual offences but for the purpose of committing a robbery and to that extent a mitigation of the sexual offences. Implicit in this submission is the concession of a contemplation by the offenders of the presence of persons in the unit, or recklessness as to whether someone was present or not, in their being armed with a weapon when entering the unit. Further the taking of the pistol is some evidence of a willingness to use it for an unlawful purpose. Subject to these matters I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the weapon was taken to advance any purpose specifically relating to the sexual assault.68 There is no evidence before me and I can make no finding as to whether either offender ejaculated. 69 There was some level of planning. It related to the selection of the relevant premises or the rejection of other premises and the selection of the most appropriate premises, the going in company and the going armed with a weapon and who would have the weapon in the premises. Those aspects of the planning were all probably done on relatively short notice, although, I am concerned with the presence of the weapon at the park for a period of a couple hours before. It is to be remembered that the evidence is that the youths went from the park in pursuit of a robbery and began their walking around without visiting anywhere first.70 It was submitted that neither type of offence was motivated by hatred for or prejudice against any group to which the offenders did not belong. As I earlier remarked by their conduct I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt there was a gender based prejudice which can best be expressed as a lack of understanding of and respect for the role and position of a woman in our community. Women are not to be viewed as menial objects whose feelings, sensitivities, do not matter, nor as objects available for random and non consensual sexual defilement.71 It was submitted and I accept that the role of the offenders in relation to the entry and the robbery are equal. While is true that only one carried the weapon both were aware of its presence and it had been transferred from one to the other. Both are equally busy unlawfully collecting items of value to take with them. 72 On the other hand O. N.’s role in the sexual offending was substantially greater than I. D.’s. O. N. appears to have instituted the sexual assaults with his demand that the victim undress. He was the first to sexually assault her. When the evidence is analysed O. N. penetrated the victim eight times while I. D. penetrated her two times and there was a third attempt. It is also to be noted that I. D.’s penetration was confined to fellatio.73 It was submitted that I would find no harm or injury was done to the victim’s son. Certainly there is no evidence of any physical injury or physical harm. However, commonsense demands that I recognise the strong likelihood of trauma at some level being experienced by the young child as a consequence of the experiences of his mother. The trauma that he is in fact experiencing is not trauma imposed directly by the offenders. It is trauma in a sense being imposed by his mother as a consequence of what the offenders did to her. If they do not understand what I mean by that, it will become apparent when I read a victim impact statement as to how she now is handling her child. No amount of shielding him from the investigations and trial could shield him from the dramatic sequelae his mother must have experience. There is also probably growing awareness that he was present and potentially at risk while two youths were perpetrating terrible violence against his mother.74 Mr White has submitted that I. D.’s involvement in the sexual acts was influenced by the acts of O N in sexually assaulting the complainant. I. D. gave evidence. If he was so influenced, that was a matter of significant importance in I. D.’s case. No evidence of what motivated or influenced I. D.’s acts leading to his sexually assaulting the complainant was led in terms that are now submitted are to be inferred. I decline to make such an inference. 75 There is no evidence that the young child was aware of what occurred. Having read the victim impact statement I am satisfied he is not yet aware his mother was sexually assaulted, although it would seem he is aware she was robbed and is troubled by the home invasion of his mother’s unit. 76 At the time of this offence O. N. was on parole. He has completed nine months of a two year parole period. His antecedents show he was sentence to three years imprisonment to conclude on 15 June 2006. That imprisonment was to be served in juvenile detention. It would appear special circumstances had been found and he was released in June 2004 after serving twelve months in a juvenile detention centre. This offending conduct occurred nine months later. He had not yet completed half of his parole period. 77 The commission of the offence whilst on parole constitutes an aggravation of the criminality. The reasons why that is so are complex, but the offenders can take it from me that the law is well established that the commission of offences whilst on parole constitutes an aggravation of the criminality of the offences that are so committed. 78 Ms Salsone argues the level of aggravation should be diminished because the offence was committed at a time when the offender had a drug dependency and both his older brothers were in custody for offences involving violence. There was an absence of significant family support for him therefore and his youth also is a factor that in my mind mitigates to some extent the level of aggravation flowing from the commission of these offences whilst on parole. A question of jurisdiction re the breakout and robbery. 79 All sexual assault charges faced by I. D. and O. N., by virtue of the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 are to be regarded as “serious indictable offences”. That is to say therefore, the sentences for those offences will be determined “according to law”. Put another way, what that means is the jurisdiction of this Court will be exercised for those offences. It will exercise the same jurisdiction that it exercises when sentencing adults. That will mean the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the relevant common law will determine the sentencing outcome for the sexual assault offences.80 The first count to which I. D. has pleaded guilty in his case is not “a serious indictable offence but an “indictable” offence. In most circumstances a juvenile offender who commits an indictable offence can be, and is sentenced by the Childrens Court, in which case penalties prescribed by the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 would apply. 81 Generally, as both offenders I imagine would know, there is more latitude given to Childrens Court judges to focus on rehabilitation than the more punitive sentencing paradigm that I must administer. Mr White has not sought to argue otherwise, at least I have no note of it, and the fact is that I. D. must be dealt with according to law for the first count in his indictment for reasons that I shall give. In WKR, (1993) 32 NSWLR 447, the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is the court that rules my Court, made it clear that although it must take account of s. 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, must also sentence according to law  
     
     where the nature and incidence of the offence have the quality of an adult crime rather than a crime deriving from the offender’s state of dependency and immaturity and  
     where, because of the nature and incidence of the crime and other personal circumstances of the offender he should not be allowed to shelter behind the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act and also  
     where it is appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment accompanied by a parole period is to be set.  
    82 The robbery and breaking out offence was done in company. A weapon was present and it was used to overpower the will of the victim so as to effect the robbery. The robbery provided a platform upon which further unlawful behaviour was committed. That is to say immediately after the robbery several serious indictable offences were committed including two such offences by I. D. In those circumstances it is appropriate that this offender should serve both a custodial sentence in a detention centre and ultimately in a period of parole under supervision. Accordingly, for the robbery offence I intend to deal with the offender, I. D. according to law in respect of the first count in the indictment (see WKR (ante) per Hunt CJ and CL). A question of midrange seriousness 83 In the course of assessing of the objective seriousness of each offender’s criminality, because these are offences, (that is the sexual assault offences), which have a standard non-parole period attached to them, I am required to assess whether any of the sexual assault offences falls within a midrange of seriousness. That is because all charged sexual assault offences are offences to be found in Item 9 of Table 2 of Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 54B(2) commands that a standard non-parole period be set unless the Court determines there are reasons for imposing a longer or shorter sentence. Section 54A confines the standard non-parole period for an offence that falls in the middle range of objective seriousness for offences in Item 9 of the Table. The standard non-parole period for these offences, if they qualify as midrange of seriousness in Item 9, is fifteen years of imprisonment. 84 My task now is to determine whether any offence falling within item 9 qualifies as one of a midrange of seriousness. 85 I have thus far reviewed the objective seriousness of all offending conduct generally. When determining whether a standard non-parole period needs to be imposed, the assessment of midrange of seriousness must be done by reference to that offence standing alone. In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, the sentencing court does not collate all of the criminality associated with the robbery, the breaking out or Form 1 matters, but simply assesses the criminality of the subject offence. While the offence is to be assessed standing alone, the circumstances in which it is committed require recognition that when the sexual assault occurred the offender was unlawfully on the premises and was there for an unlawful purpose, namely robbery. 86 As I earlier remarked, each subsequent sexual assault must be regarded as involving more serious criminality because of the sexual violence already administered to the victim. Clearly she was more damaged and more distraught after each attack upon her, therefore, subsequent attacks are more serious criminal conduct. 87 My inquiry now requires consideration as to the actual actions of each offence, the consequences of the offender’s conduct upon the victim and to such factors as may have affected each offender’s mental functioning when determining to commit the offence and during its commission (see R V Way [2004] 60 NSWLR 168 at [85] – [86]). 88 Putting to one side the offences relating to a joint penetration of the complainant without her consent and to the act of anal intercourse committed by O. N., I have determined that the remaining sexual assaults would not reach a midrange of seriousness. These offences were conduct that was committed by one offender or the other, although while in company of the other, not in the immediate presence of the other. The others support was more tacit than direct. There is no evidence that the sexual assaults had been planned prior to arrival in the flat. If the evidence of O. N. is accepted, and it was not challenged in cross-examination, they did not know anyone was at home and selected the place after walking around as the most suitable place to rob. 89 I have expressed my reservations about this aspect of the evidence, or absence of it. Even so, on any view, there is no evidence either knew the identity of the persons present before they walked into the lounge room. I accept the offences were not the result of any planning or contemplation until after they arrived in the lounge room. A single episode of fellatio or even vaginal intercourse without more, committed by these offenders in such circumstances would not in my view be sufficient to place that sexual assault within a midrange. There was violence by way of threats, including a threat to harm her child. Further violence arose in forcing the victim from one site to another. While the threats and violence additional to the sexual assaults must have been terrifying, I do not accept the level was such to take those generally earlier episodes into the midrange of seriousness. 90 I have indicated I do not regard either offender as so affected by alcohol and drugs as to be impaired in forming intent or exercising the will necessary to carry out the acts constituting their criminal conduct. There is however, a growing body of research coming to public knowledge that the functioning of the human brain changes with the years as a child develops into an adult. The research points to the brain generally not being in their adult form until a person is in their mid twenties. Young children it seems make decisions from part of the brain known as the amygdala, primarily an emotional centre of the brain. Adults use a different area for decision making, the prefrontal cortex. Male teenagers it seems, so far as decision making is concerned can be regarded as half developed. That is their brain functions well in calm situations but may lack ability to make good decisions when overloaded by stimuli. 91 As I say recent research is exploring this phenomenon. However, before one can move from the general to the particular there would need to be expert evidence related to the particular offenders before the Court and to the extent, if any, to which the phenomenon related to them. The Crown would also need an opportunity to test such evidence. That has not happened in this case. In this case my approach is to recognise the existence of the research, but also recognise that the extent to which it applies in this case, if at all, has not been established in the evidence. On any view though the immaturity of the offenders is a matter that would impact upon their designs. 92 The consumption of alcohol and drugs would have adversely affected the part of the brain making judgments. The Court is familiar with evidence frequently called in drink driving and drug driving cases as to adverse effects consumption of alcohol and drugs has upon the function of the judgment part of the brain. The consequences of those earlier offences upon the complainant, while no doubt very telling, were not in the category of the consequence the joint episode of penetration or anal intercourse had upon her. 93 The episode of joint penetration and the episode of anal intercourse must each qualify as an offence falling in the midrange of seriousness as viewed on the objective criminality of each. Each offender after the violence of several other sexual assaults, required the complainant to permit unprotected penetration of her mouth and vagina without her consent to two total strangers whose sexual history she did not know so both could share her deep humiliation, discomfort and terror in some debauched male bonding process. The pistol was present. These offences were being committed in her own home. I. D. had not committed as many acts of penetration as O. N. at this point. Nonetheless, he is a co-offender who was sexually assaulting the complainant in the circumstances I have just described. He was also present there for moral support for the co-offender when the co-offender was committing other offences and his victim well knew she was dealing with two intruders should she seek to struggle. 94 What elevates these offences to midrange of seriousness is the joint penetration once account is taken of all of the matters referred to. The impact of this offence upon the complainant must, as I have said, been far more profound than the other offences thus far committed. 95 The other offence qualifying as an offence falling in the mid-range of seriousness on its objective facts, is the episode of anal intercourse. It is the last of ten episodes of penetration of the complainant. Anal intercourse is a far more objectionable form of penetration of person’s intimacy than others. It results in greater physical pain to the victim than the other forms of penetration. It brings generally, greater humiliation and emotional trauma than other forms of intercourse. This offence must also have impacted more profoundly upon her than other forms of penetration. Victims Impact Statement96 I turn now to the victim impact statement I have received from the complainant. The material contained in the victim impact statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subjected to cross- examination. It comes indirectly from the primary victim in circumstances where, although it is hearsay, it seems to me I may accept it as reliable unsworn evidence of facts as to the offences and their effect on upon her. The function of victim impact statements such as this one is firstly to give to the victims an opportunity of being heard in sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon her by the actions of her offenders. 97 Secondly, it enables the sentencing proceedings to assist her as she moves toward. hopefully, some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of the offenders.98 Thirdly, the victim impact statement contributes to each offender at least hearing, and perhaps gaining an insight into the impact that his offending conduct had upon this victim. Finally the victim impact statement ensures that the court has a continuing consciousness of impact that violent crime has upon the ordinary men and women who are its victims. As such, a victim impact statement plays an important part in the administration of criminal justice. 99 Not surprisingly, the complainant says that while she was being assaulted, she was in fear of her very life every minute. She felt sure she was to be shot and she dreaded, whilst being attacked, that her son would wake to find that his mother was dead. She refers to a mask falling off and one of the men then saying “shoot her” and she thought that as a result of the mask falling off, she would be shot dead.100 Her focus was mainly on her son during the episode and she was begging them to spare her life because of her son. She said she felt that she had to do everything that they asked. She now hates herself that she did not do more to resist. While one man was assaulting her, she noticed that the other left the room and her concern was that he had gone to the son’s room to do something about him. It is that reference to the son’s room that puts me in some doubt as to where the son was during the episodes. 101 When the assailants left, she went immediately to her son, grabbed him and was sobbing and was relieved, immensely relieved that he was alive. She had been fearful that he might have been sexually molested. 102 At hospital she was terrified of doing the examination and then the tests. She was fearful she had contracted a sexual disease. She had to wait three months for the test results to come back and she spent that entire time believing that she may have contracted AIDS or a sexual disease. Subsequent to the assault, she was unable to sleep at all and she was unable, as it were, to stay awake. She began to focus on doing extra shifts to see if she could exhaust herself, and also to keep herself out of her house because she was afraid of being home alone. She works two shifts so that, as she describes it, she can sleep like a dead person. She has now got her house deadlocked from the inside and feels that she is locking herself “like in a prison”. She will not allow her son out on the balcony, she will not allow her son to answer the door, even when his father is coming. Her son now sleeps in the same bedroom as she does because she is afraid for him to be alone. She is afraid something will happen to him. She is afraid and now she says he is also fearful because he has a sense of her fear. She now is depressed and says she is not the same person she was. She is fearful that people may find out that she has been raped because in her culture, where a woman is raped, it is said to be her fault and she is then cut off from her community. She is afraid therefore that someone will ask her questions about the episode and she may be caught in a position where she cannot deny that she was raped, and so she runs away from people.103 She claimed to be a very sociable person before this episode. My knowledge of Fijians is that they usually are. She used to have outings with her son on the weekends, now she does nothing. When she goes out she wears a hat so it hides her face in the hope that she will not be recognised by others. She does not watch TV any more, because some of the scenes on TV remind her of the assault and are triggers for her memory. She believes herself to be short-tempered with her son, she finds herself shouting at him and will not let him watch anything on TV except children’s programs. She recognises that what she is doing to her son is bad, she knows she did not want to bring him up like this, she wanted him to grow up in an Australian culture, but she is terrified of letting him go. She is afraid to shop alone, when she sees young men she thinks of you two, even though she knows that you are in custody. She knows there is no logic in it, but she cannot help herself. She has panic attacks, becomes startled for instance, if the phone rings. She checks the peephole at the door even when her sisters visit, notwithstanding that they have telephoned her, indicating that they are coming. 104 The only people she believes she can spend her time with now, are her sisters and her partner. Her sisters have been very supportive and her partner has been supportive but she does not believe he understands what she is going through. She says it is impossible to forget. She now does not want a relationship any more but maintains the relationship for the sake of her son because she wants to keep the son’s father involved in his life.105 She cannot bear any sexual relationship any more because it brings back the episodes that she experienced the day you people were there. She has nightmares when she is asleep and when she awakes, she can feel the events happening in her body. Sometimes that occurs to her out of the blue without a trigger. She says if it was not for her son being alive, she would sooner be dead.106 When the gun was pointed at her son, she knew she had to obey you but she hates herself for doing so. Her only pleasure now is her work. She has no future except for the son. There is nothing for her at all she says. 107 At the trial she was to give evidence on closed circuit television and on the day of the trial she was shaking and fearful and at the last minute when the pleas were entered, she felt a great relief. She has gained fifteen kilograms in weight and is eating constantly. She says she is freaked out at the sight of any man and gives as an example a day that she went to the garage or was going down to the garage and there was a man on the stairwell. She yelled and was shaking and she sat on the stairs. The gentleman who was there got a fright, incomprehensible as to why she was screaming at him. He left and she sat there for half an hour until she calmed down. 108 She gives another example when there were two men inside fixing a car at the garages in the apartments. She got out of her car and she panicked. It was night, she left the headlights on and the door of the car open, grabbed her son and ran upstairs. By the next day when she got down, not surprisingly, her battery was dead but she will not go in the car park now. She no longer parks downstairs and she parks off the street. She moved out of that unit two months after the assault because she could not stand being there because she could see reminders of the episode everywhere. 109 She is fearful that she will be found by one or other of you or that your families will come after her. She is afraid to be alone and she cannot leave her son alone. She does not take her boy to the park any more because she is afraid people will recognise her. She took him to the park one day but was unable to get out of the car, even though her son was crying. She feels that her son is paying the price. She now has to beg people to come places with her, to take her son with her, and she feels she is bribing them because she offers them lunch. She often, she says, goes to the shower to cry so that no-one can hear her. She will not go to counselling, she cannot bear to talk about it. She thinks that when the sentencing procedures are over, she may try to go and see what she can do about talking about recovery.110 The diagnosis of the professional that saw her said that she is suffering chronic post-traumatic stress disorder of a type that is typical following violent sexual assaults. There are some terms here which you may not understand, such as hyper-arousal, hyper-vigilance, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, memories, intense fear, inability to tolerate anything that might trigger a memory, constant reliving experiences and avoidance behaviours and severe insomnia. She has also developed a major depressive disorder. She has a severe agitated depressive disturbance. She has suicidal feelings which I know both of you have had. She has apathy. She has gained weight which is symptomatic of depression and she is unable to enjoy sexual activity. She is unable to provide her son with adequate parenting. 111 The professional who looked at her said that she was basically a strong-minded and well-adapted woman prior to the assault. The professional thought that it may be with some time she will make a recovery, but at the moment she is grossly disturbed and will need considerable professional assistance to assist her. The professional says this:  
     
      
       
      [that] it would seem inevitable that her child will also be psychologically damaged as a consequence of her mother’s disturbance. Her profound fear and anxiety will be communicated to him and cause him alarm and this may have a permanent impact on his personality development. It is unlikely that he can understand at present what may appear to be the sudden loss of his mother, in that she is no longer emotionally available to him as she once was. Depending on how he construes this, it may have a profound impact on his developing psychology. 
      
    Subjective matters112 I turn now to the subjective matters. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence, but I am also sentencing each offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to that offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of the offences by these offenders or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. 113 I am going to first deal with O. N.Family Background and Social Dynamics114 O.N., presently aged eighteen years and six months was sixteen years nine months at the time of offending.115 He has two older brothers and four younger siblings. The family migrated to Australia from Lebanon. This offender’s upbringing and background was in a home where violence was normalised. The father gambled, drank, took drugs, and physically abused his wife, even when she was pregnant. He did so when she was pregnant with O. N. and there were subsequent problems with that pregnancy. The offender’s mother noticed there were problems with O. N. after he was born. Because of the father’s gambling, he did not provide well for the family, claiming the mother’s pension would be adequate. The family lived at Wiley Park.116 The report of Katie Seidler, a forensic psychologist who specialised in children’s matters, made this observation on the history given by the offender:  
     
      
       
      “O. N. described a very difficult and turbulent family life, coloured by familial discord and both excessive and regular violence. He stated his father was regularly violent with his mother and O. N. witnessed this on many occasions which he claimed was “awful to see”. In addition he stated that his father was often violent with both he and his siblings, and not only in discipline. He said that his father used any excuse to be violent, hitting his children mainly with closed fists, in addition to other household objects if he was so “tempted”. 
      
    117 O. N. ’s parents separated whilst he was on parole. This separation is reported as being “bitter”. These offences of course, also occurred while the offender was on parole. The two eldest sons are currently incarcerated. The father himself was at one stage imprisoned for a stabbing offence. There is still contact between father and the offender.118 Coming back to Ms Seidler’s report: 
     
      
       
      “Overall, O. N. described his childhood as being “shit” mainly as a result of the violence colouring all aspects of his family life”. 
       
       
      It appears that he was indoctrinated into a violent and antisocial life from a very young age which was further cemented by the behaviour of his older brothers, poor supervision, and other young people in his local area. He stated that he has never achieved independence and was still living at home with his mother when he was taken into custody. O. N. also reported that his older brother has mental health problems. 
      
    Education, vocational History119 His formal schooling began in Lebanon. He found learning English easy but found studying and learning generally, more difficult. His mother reports there was physical abuse of the offender by the father during schooling in the context which made me think it was also related to doing homework.120 O. N. attended Belmore High School. The schooling for him was difficult. He truanted. He was disruptive and has been suspended. He left Belmore High in Year 9 to go to a special school. It would seem that he left at the end of Year 9 to work in Hungry Jacks. 121 During his time in custody since his arrest, he has successfully completed a number of Year 10 subjects and is committed to studying Year 11. His post-release plans focus on a career in hospitality, principally as a chef. He gave evidence that it would be possible to do the Chef Apprentice Course at Baxter Juvenile Detention Centre. He also intended to do his Higher School Certificate at Baxter. Ultimately he says he may seek employment as a chef on a cruise ship. Whether he does so or not, the acquisition of the skills is important.122 He has completed a hospitality course, as well as components of labouring, horticulture and music. A number of certificates have been tendered providing supporting evidence of his commitment to study whilst in custody. As best one can tell at this time, his approach and post-release plans are realistic. They bear an important part in determining a suitable custodial situation for him.Health123 As far as I can tell from observing him in court he presents as physically healthy. He has in the past suffered fractures through domestic violence assaults and it would seem through other assaults. Otherwise there do not appear to be any significant physical problems.Drug and Alcohol Addition & Abuse 124 These are best picked up in Ms Seidler’s report.  
     
      
       
      “O. N. ’s biggest concern is with cannabis. He reported he enjoyed the use of this drug. He described it as ‘the best thing that’s going around’.  
       
       
      Nevertheless, he claimed that he does not want to return to using when he is released, because he is concerned about the financial cost as well as the long term cognitive consequences of extended drug use. O. N. reported that he has participated in drug and alcohol counselling for many years. He did this first through Barnardos in the community. He did not find this helpful... O. N. said that he continued with drug and alcohol counselling in custody and has found this to be of benefit.  
      
    125 He claimed that he is interested in continuing his counselling. The programs that he has done whilst in counselling is a twelve week alcohol and other programs managing substance abuse and, it seems, another smart recovery. Even so, it may still be there is work to be done. As earlier mentioned he regarded cannabis as “the best thing going around”. At the levels he was smoking, 100 cones a day, impressed me as being very heavy. He was at risk of serious psychiatric or psychological damage. Mental Health126 There have been three significant episodes of suicidal ideation, one occurring at Reiby and two at Kariong. The last arising or associated with these court proceedings. The earlier two, are dealt with, by Ms Seidler. She took a history given by O. N. of depression starting around the age of fourteen or fifteen, which he mainly associated with being incarcerated. His depression was associated with a feeling that there was no-one there to help him and that there was no-one that cared about him. He has reported frequent contact with several psychologists. 127 The last episode was referred to in one of the Juvenile Justice documents. He has had frequent contact with several psychologists. He was referred to the school counsellor as a younger child because of his behavioural difficulties at school. He saw the psychologist from Barnardos. He has been in contact with psychologists in each of the juvenile justice centres he has been in. He does claim that he has found the psychological counselling to be of benefit because it provides him with someone to talk about his problems. He says that he is motivated to continue with the counselling. Psycho-sexual Development128 It would seem that generally he is regarded as quiet and withdrawn socially. He is single at present and is yet to have a long term relationship. He has had a number of sexual encounters, all casual, what he describes as one night stands. He has had sex with a prostitute and attended strip shows on his own and with friends. He has accessed hard core pornography depicting adult heterosexual and lesbian activity. He uses pornography to learn about sex and to fuel his sexual fantasies. Ms Seidler opines  
     
      
       
      “that he was unable to articulate any specific motivations for the sexual aspects of the offence that he has committed, other than that he and his friend wanted to have sex. It is my understanding she says, that O. N. ’s offending behaviour occurred within the context of a general core antisocial boundaries, limited community or pro-social involvement, an early and unhelpful initiation into sexual behaviour and a peer culture that encourages sexualisation and objectification of women”. 
      
    129 I should also note that my own experience so far as the law is concerned is that pornography quite frequently normalises what would otherwise be abnormal or unacceptable sexual behaviour. 130 While dealing with mental health it is important that I have regard to his aggressive and impulsive behaviour. That aggressive and impulsive behaviour is manifested particularly in violence. O. N. has a history of violence dating back to his childhood years. He was involved in physical fights from childhood and carried through to his adolescent. The history that he gave to Ms Seidler led her to believe that he accepted violence as a means of dealing with interpersonal conflict. That he seems to have adopted violence as a strategy to meet his ends or his desires, or needs, whatever they might be. She uses an example, his being placed in segregation after making threats against the staff on the basis that she was told that that was prompted by a desire to move out of the particular wing where the threats were made. It may have been that there was a sense of desperation because he had been threatened and assaulted by other inmates, but nonetheless, what he has resorted to in his panic is violence rather than some other means. 131 To conclude the overview of the mental health issues, it is worthwhile looking again at what Ms Seidler says.  
     
      
       
      O. N. appears to be a quite vulnerable young man psychologically. It’s likely that he has experienced mood and emotion difficulties for some years related to his family situation. He has a long history of behaviour difficulties and interpersonal aggression which also has its bases in his upbringing. He was raised in a family where violence and aggression were normalised. There was little opportunity for development to positive coping resources. This encouraged his involvement in antisocial activities and has now given rise to paranoid and suspicious thinking commonly associated with participation in a criminal subculture. Essentially he has an emerging form of severe personality disorder marked by a paranoid, borderline and antisocial traits. 
      
    132 I should at this time say that a personality profile like this is a snapshot. It is what you were on the day the snapshot was taken. You can continue to develop the snapshot or you can work on the snapshot and become a different person. You are not bound to keep the qualities that have been observed of you. 133 Ms Seidler attempted a cognitive assessment. She came to a view on the tests that she administered that O. N. intellectual skills were better than between one per cent and two per cent of his age peers. As such she said he was considered to be a very low functioning young man, probably in the domain of a mild intellectual disability. That testing was compromised by the fact that he was handcuffed. She nonetheless thought that a mild intellectual disability was consistent with his history of delayed speech development and school learning difficulties in addition to his presentation at the interview. 134 She does not appear to be aware of the offender’s complete educational program whilst in custody. His evidence was that he did Year Ten studies last year in General Maths, English, Science, History and Geography. Greg Robertson reports he successfully completed his Year Ten certificate and was moving towards Year Eleven in Maths, English, History, Business Studies, Hospitality and Religion. While I accept that he has had difficulties with his study, and might observe who would not in the environment that he was raised in, I am not prepared to accept a cognitive assessment that places him as lowly as her test results would indicate. I suspect that he, being handcuffed in the interview was counter-productive for the testing undertaken. Criminal History135 These offences are by far and away his most serious offending to date. While he has prior criminal history, he has no history of sexual offending. The prior conviction was for armed robbery. When sentenced for the armed robbery, an offence of being carried in a conveyance was taken into account. His record is not extensive. This second bout of serious offending is nonetheless disturbing. Given his youth, his record does not disentitle him to consideration for rehabilitation.Custody136 He has been in custody since his arrest on 3 April 2005. By and large he appears to have been willing to progress his rehabilitation through counselling, visits to psychologists, attending drug and alcohol programs and educational courses. He has had some positive interaction with Barnardos post release options program, both at the time of his last release and on occasions between December and January 2005, 2006. That he has exited from that program now, but he knows of its existence and is able to be re-referred to them upon his release in future. Post release plans are an important step towards guaranteeing an easier passage of reintegration into the community and therefore a significant step in rehabilitation. 137 However, his custody has not all been smooth sailing. There have been a number of breaches of discipline recorded, four of which I regard as significant. There was in August 2005, a breach of damage and destroying property. There was in November 2005, an assault on an inmate. There was in February 2006 contraband expected for an escape and possession of an offensive weapon. They are both dated very close to each other. Although there have been two subsequent breaches of discipline on his custody record, for the purposes of sentencing I do not regard them as having any significance in which case he appears to have been in no serious custody trouble since February of last year. 138 Given these proceedings have been ongoing since March, and my memory was he joined the proceedings in June of last year, he appears to have handled the stress associated with this litigation reasonably well. Also, however, he has had periods of segregation. He gave evidence that there were two periods in 2006. He said page 8, 26/11/06 at about point 5  
     
      
       
      ...that the second time [of segregation] was [for] the same reason as the first. The inmates that I had problems with the first time, they came back to the centre and then I went to my school to speak to my counsellor to ask him if I can have, like to move away from the inmates and then that’s when they put me in segro for three months.  
      
    139 Of course I suspect that that is the incident where he was abusive to staff. 140 Robertson also writes, in respect of custody, 
     
      
       
      Currently O. N. is on level 3 classification and is placed in the unit that entitles him to the most privileges while in custody. Once again this is a recognition of the positive progress he is currently making while in custody. It is noted that O. N. is demonstrating growth and maturity, positive acceptance of responsibility for his offending behaviours and a greater level of self-awareness and behavioural management”. 
      
    Contrition141 He has pleaded guilty to all charges from the outset. It would seem and Ms Salsone has so indicated, that he instructed his counsel not to negotiate or bargain on the charges. An example of this to his detriment was his willingness to accept full responsibility, not only for his offending in the joint criminal sexual assault upon the complainant, but also responsibility for his co-offender, (see counts 4 and 9).142 Count 9 is an act of fellatio by a co-offender, but he has accepted culpability for it separately even though count 10 is an act of penile intercourse with the complainant without her consent in circumstances where that act is an act of joint penetration with the co-offender. 143 He has also given evidence of contrition. 144 Finally there is a letter that he has written to me which should be read. 
     
      
       
      “Your Honour, first I would like to say that I recognise the seriousness of the crime that I am in for. Your Honour, since my arrival here I have sat down and thought what I have done. I have done something horrific to a person which they didn’t deserve to go through what they went through. I know the crime I did has a big effect on the person that had to go through it. It has changed their lives. They are finding it difficult to do, what they usually do like daily business and other things. Your Honour, the reason I’m writing this letter is so I can say sorry to the person that got caught up in this horrific thing. I am personally willing to say sorry to the person face to face, but if not, by letter. Your Honour, I am determined to change my life and I want to prove to my parents that I can change”. 
      
    145 There is other material in there but that is the portion of the letter that I wish to put on the record.Plea146 The plea was early entered. It represents a full acknowledgment of responsibility for offending conduct. It also demonstrates contrition. It is consistent with other efforts being made by him to advance his rehabilitation. I am satisfied he also is seeking closure on this matter. I intend to give a twenty five percent discount of the sentences I otherwise would have given in the light of pleas and the contrition demonstrated.Rehabilitation Prospects147 There are some positive signs but there is still a long way to go. 
     
     He has support from family members including both parents and some siblings; 
     He is making good progress in his education; 
     He is attending drug and alcohol courses; 
     His conduct in custody is improving, positive reports are coming out, generally he is seeking to use his custody productively; 
     He is beginning to develop healthy post release plans particularly to qualify as a chef; 
     He has prospects of accommodation and support on release; 
     He has access to psychological counselling and other supports for the immediate future, particularly should he remain in juvenile detention; 
     He wants to participate in the sex offender programmes available at Baxter; 
    148 There are however some negative indicators. 
     
     Three other members of his family have offended against the law to an extent where they have been placed in custody. Two of them will still be a strong influence on him, that is his brothers. The father also, is still in contact with him.  
     He still expresses very positive attitudes to cannabis, a drug he was heavily addicted to. 
    149 The psychological report identifies a number of issues that need addressing including his propensity for violence. He still has the impact of his dysfunctional upbringing to resolve and move on from. The clothing of baggage that that upbringing saddled him with, to mix my metaphors, is still with him. He has breached his last parole with very serious criminal offending To the extent that his last parole can be a predictor of future outcome, it does not bode positively.150 To emphasise the need for caution I am annexing to his warrant Ms Sidler’s report. She has done a risk assessment with static and historic features. Her report emphasises the need for caution.151 I turn now to I. D. and his subjective matters.Personal Circumstances and Family Social Dynamics152 I. D. is now eighteen years and seven months. He was sixteen years, nine months at the time of offence. He is a single youth. His parents separated as best I can determine in 2003. He is the second of four children. The family immigrated as refugees from Algeria in 1994. The offender’s father was a strict disciplinarian. I. D. gave evidence his father was physically beating him until he left in 2003. Whether to his credit or not he still has a strong sense of loyalty to his father and it seems is reluctant to fully disclose the nature and fullness of the abuse is father administered to him.153 I. D.’s elder brother Riad tried to act as a surrogate father, although no doubt well intended, his efforts were rejected by I. D. It may be Riad’s methods of discipline were not dissimilar to the father’s. There is an episode that I am aware of Riad punching this offender in the face at a time when the offender had been consuming cannabis.154 I. D.’s family appear to be supportive of him, with mother and sister maintaining weekly visits. They have been here on other occasions; although none of the family of either offender is here today. It appears there is also some telephone contact.155 Once the father left, I. D. felt less need to comply with his mother’s requests. In Muslim culture if I understand correctly, the eldest male takes on a function as head of the family. It would appear the offender had difficulty accepting Riad’s role in this.156 Bearing in mind the devaluing of the female victim of these offences, an observation made by Helena Greeks of the offender’s upbringing has a strong resonance. 
     
      
       
      I. D. presents as a young person with a history of familiar discord and disparaging gender stereotypical value system which exposed the household to victimisation, ridicule and criticism. The main subject of the discord, disparagement, ridicule and criticism was the offender’s mother at the hands of the most prominent male in the family.” 
      
    157 I have sought to make a case that disparagement, disrespect and contempt for the victim was displayed by both offenders. It is hard to resist that the foundations for their contempt of the victim was gender based and learned in both cases within the family at the hands of the senior adult male.Education Employment Skills158 This offender also attended Belmore High School. He gained his school certificate in 2004. He is of average intelligence but was not performing to his ability. The view from the school is that he has the potential to achieve greater scholastic results.159 He gave evidence and presented as an articulate, well spoken young man. In custody he has pursued Year 11 studies. Staff at the George Anderson Walpole School find him co-operative, relating well to his fellow students and capable of working independently and in groups. Such persons are usually well equipped in terms of their intelligence or at least adequately equipped. There is no history of behavioural concerns whilst in custody.160 Tendered to the Court are six certificates of reports showing commitment to education, drug and alcohol and other rehabilitation initiatives during 2006 whilst in custody. I .D. has casual work experience as a labourer, carpet cleaner and a couple of jobs including storeman. It is likely his work experience is not extensive but at least he does have an understanding of the skills required for a number of jobs.161 The offender has expressed interest in attending TAFE to complete civil engineering. Whilst at Kariong he has completed courses in hairdressing, pottery and ceramics. The wider the skill base the more employable he would become upon release.Health162 I. D. presents as a healthy looking young man. Nothing in the reports or the evidence suggests he is not in reasonable physical and mental health. There may be some depression, its causes are unclear. He reports that at thirteen he wanted to end his life.163 While cognitive assessment was undertaken by Anna Saad it is unlikely it was entirely reliable. Her results indicate him to be in the bottom thirty percent in terms of intelligence, however he appears not to have finished the test “because he couldn’t be bothered”. Ms Saad’s assessment is the test is not a true reflection. His answers in evidence, his past scholastic achievement and his aspirations to study civil engineering belie the incomplete test results.Drug and Alcohol Issues164 I .D. seems to claim his drug abuse was peer driven. If so he is avoiding responsibility for his role in it. His peers introduced him he says to cannabis when he was fifteen. He subsequently abused heroin, ecstasy and cocaine. He was then only sixteen. He used primarily he says in the pressure of older peers. Again it would appear he is passing responsibility for his use of cannabis to others.165 His use of drugs sidetracked him from and interfered with his school attendance. He claims to have been drug affected at the time of the offence. I have dealt with that. His cannabis use escalated to three grams daily. He used sleeping pills two times weekly to deal with the effects of withdrawing from his weekly cocaine use. He claims his substance abuse was closely linked to the lifestyle he and his peers were pursuing. Again I notice the reference to the peers and I see an absence of responsibility implicit in that.166 He claims to have addressed his substance abuse and does not feel counselling is necessary. Howeveron his account of it his peers are not present and if he is blaming his peers, on his logic I cannot really tell whether he is cured or not. It is likely he is wrong.Criminal History167 The offender has no prior criminal history. He does however admit to criminal conduct including thieving to support his drug habit. Even so he is entitled to the benefit of being regarded as a person of prior good character with no criminal history. As such he is entitled to some leniency, although given the seriousness of his offending, that leniency will need to be more muted than it otherwise might have been.Plea168 The plea was entered late. As was made clear by the Crown it had significant utilitarian value in a particular respect. The victim had made clear in her victim impact statement and on the day of the trial the relief she felt when she did not have to give evidence. There are other utilitarian values in the plea including his accepting accountability for his conduct and the community’s satisfaction in seeing those who are guilty of criminal conduct being held accountable for it. There is utilitarian value in the plea, in as much as it is unlikely an appeal against convictions will be made.169 The plea promotes confidence in the investigation of crime by police. All of these are important utilitarian facts. Late entered as it was, it cannot have as much significance as one early entered, that is entered in the Local Court. Generally the discount for a late entered plea lies somewhere between ten to fifteen percent.170 There are two further reasons why I intend to increase that discount to one of seventeen and a half percent. Firstly I am satisfied the plea is accompanied by contrition, although contrition late encountered. Secondly, the importance of the sexual offender acknowledging his guilt is of great importance in the healing process of the victim’s sexual assault.171 For those reasons as I say I intend to discount the sentences I otherwise would have given by seventeen and a half percent. There is evidence before me and I am prepared to accept that this offender is contrite. While his plea was late, it does not necessarily mean he did not regret his acts, particularly when he was made aware as I am no doubt he was, of the gross consequences of his acts for him in terms of future custody. Certainly he has discovered from other inmates that they regard his crime as an abhorrence. They have demonstrated that in attacks upon him, as indeed I should have mentioned there have also been attacks upon O. N. I. D. too wrote a letter which I want to make part of the sentencing proceeding.172 His letter says this; 
     
      
       
      I stand here today in court a very remorseful person. If I knew back when I committed this offence what I know now I would have been in a very different place. I struggle everyday with the memory of what I have done. I know that using the effects of drugs as an excuse is not acceptable and does not help my victim and her family to understand why this happened. The crime was done in a moment of stupidity and immaturity. Since this happened I had lots of time to reflect and try to make a big effort to change the way my life was going. I am studying my Year 11 at school and always make an effort everyday to do the right thing. I know I cannot change what I have done and that sorry doesn’t seem to mean much to the court and to the victim and her family, but I am sincerely regretful of my actions and hope that one day I will be able to put this behind me and become a successful and competent member of our community. 
      
    Rehabilitation Prospects173 The factors in support of a positive rehabilitation prognosis include:  
     
     Good family support.  
     Willingness to provide accommodation and support by family upon release.  
     Contrition and some insight into the impact of his offence upon the victim.  
     A willingness to undertake the Sexual Offender’s program at Baxter.  
     Some positive use of time during custody on programs and advance his rehabilitation one which I have missed.  
     Progress which he has made whilst in custody. 
    Negative Indicators 
     
     The impact of his upbringing and disparaging attitude towards women ingrained in him as a consequence of that upbringing.  
     A past entrenched history of drug abuse. It is problematic whether this issue has been satisfactorily resolved.  
     A past history of poor self discipline. To his credit he has recognised that he preferred his unruly peer involved over the more sober lifestyle that his mother was urging upon him during the time of his drug taking.  
    174 My assessment of his rehabilitative prospects are that he is likely to progress positively in his rehabilitation, provided he maintains and builds upon the commitment to the courses whilst he is studying.175 I include details, provided by Department of Juvenile Justice of the sex offenders course available at Baxter Juvenile Detention Centre:  
     
      
       
      A sex-offending (sic) program is in place, which is based on the Pathway Program that incorporates modules pertaining to Cognitive Distortions, Victim Empathy and Relapse Prevention. Face-to-face counselling is provided on a weekly basis and the program is ongoing depending on the developmental/emotional maturation of the young person and their responsiveness in developing new and appropriate ways in communicating and relating to significant others. The young person is referred to the program follwing admission into the centre. 
      
    Setting the Sentence Standard Non Parole Period176 A review of the subject features for each offender establishes that each was not yet seventeen when these criminal offences were committed. I have taken youth into account when determining whether these offences qualified as a mid range of seriousness. However, the youth of the offenders is a matter that I can take into account as a reason for not imposing a standard non parole period. Given the important of rehabilitation in the sentencing of juveniles and the counter rehabilitation influence of adult prison on young men I would have relied on the youth and general immaturity of the offenders as a reason for not imposing a standard non parole period. 177 There is, however, a more powerful and stronger reason. The case law makes it clear a standard non- parole period must be taken to have been intended for a mid-range of seriousness case where the offender had been convicted after trial (see Way). In this case I shall not be imposing the standard non-parole period. 178 However, it is important, I acknowledge, the significance of the standard non-parole period. While it is confined to applying to a mid range of seriousness offences after trial, it has impacted on all offences charged under s 61JA Crimes Act 1900. That is to say the Parliament, by creating a standard non-parole period well above the non-parole periods that previously applied for offences of mid-range seriousness, has indicated that it requires penalties for s61 JA offences, to be harsher than the Court was previously imposing. The availability of the standard non-parole period has driven upwards sentences for all aggravated sexual assaults. The Proper Approach to Sentencing Young Persons179 This Court will only be sentencing juvenile offenders when the offence committed is a serious indictable offence, or when pursuant to the discretion created by s 18 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, the offences is one calling for sentencing at law. In those cases the criminality associated with the offence is likely to be gravely serious. I take my guidance for sentence these young offenders from Hunt J.  
     
      
       
      “The youth of an offender is always of significance in sentencing whether or not he is a person to whom s 6 of the Children’s Criminal Proceedings Act applies.” 
      
    180 I do not quite understand that reference, because s 6 is meant to apply in all cases of sentencing children.  
     
      
       
      “The young offender is normally entitled to the benefit of the principle, but because of his relative youth the usual consideration of general deterrence is not as important as it is when sentencing an adult of greater maturity and the consideration of rehabilitation plays a very important role... 
       
       
      The principle is subject to the qualification that, where a youth conducts himself in the way an adult might conduct himself and commits a crime of considerable gravity, the functions of the court to protect the community requires deterrence and retribution to remain significant elements in sentencing him ... That is not to say however that his youth is to be disregarded in the sentencing process. Far from it.  
      It is of particular relevance in determining the appropriate relationship between the minimum and additional terms, and it remains an element (albeit less significant than usual) to be considered in assessing the length of the sentence to be imposed. 
       General deterrence however remains a primary importance in the circumstances of the case.” 
      
    181 See also The Queen and Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at 461[38] - [39] on the same point where a number of the cases are referred to. 182 Cases from overseas superior jurisdictions can often assist in clarification of principles and the basis for them. Roper v Simmons 543 U.S. 2005 1 is a decision from the US Supreme Court. It appeals to me as such a case. While it was concerned with the appropriateness of the death penalty for juvenile offenders, some principles at pp 15-16, crystallised therein are of value here:  
     
      
       
      Three general differences between juveniles under 18 and adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders. First, as any parent knows and as the scientific and sociological studies respondent and his  
      amici 
      cite tend to confirm ""[a] lack of maturity and an under developed sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults and are more understandable among the young. These qualities often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions"". ""Even the normal 16 year old customarily lacks the maturity of an adult."" It has been noted that ""adolescents are overrepresented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behaviour."" In recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every State prohibits those under 18 years of age from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent. 
       
       
      The second area of difference is that juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. ""[Y] outh is more than a chronological fact. It is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage"". This is explained in part by the prevailing circumstances that juveniles have less control, or less experience with control, over their own environment. ""[A]s legal minors, [juveniles] lack the freedom that adults have to extricate themselves from a crimonogenic setting"".  
       
       
      The third broad difference is that the character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult. The personality traits of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed. 
       
       
      Theses differences render suspect any conclusion that a juvenile falls among the worst offenders. The susceptibility of juveniles to immature and irresponsible behaviour means ""their irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult."" Their own vulnerability and comparative lack of control over their immediate surroundings mean juveniles have a greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their whole environment. The reality that juveniles still strugle to define their identity means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvinile is evidence of irretrievably deparaved character. From a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that a minor's character deficiencies will be reformed. Indeed, ""[t]he relevance of youth as a mitigating factor derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth are transient; as individuals mature, the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside."" ""For most teens, [risky or antisocial] behaviours are fleeting; they cease with maturity as individual identity becomes settled. Only a relatively small proportion of adolescents who experiment in risky or illegal activities develop entrenched patters of problem behaviour that persist into adulthood."" (Authorities and citations omitted). 
      
    183 This is an offence for general deterrence is appropriate. I note what Kennedy J referred to in Roper above however it is useful to distinguish between specific deterrence which is what he is talking about for like-minded persons and general deterrence. 184 In modern Australian society there is a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by the Federal and State Parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by Parliament is to deter those tempted to breach its provisions. Parliament does that by prescribing penalties for those engaged in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. For instance, in this case, the sexual assault offences carry a maximum term of life imprisonment. The robbery with breaking out carries a maximum penalty of twenty years. Consequently when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, he or she is exposed to that possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. Sentencing for the breaches of the criminal law requires a sentencing judge to keep in mind those general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large, by keeping in mind the maximum penalties available and their deterrent purposes. 185 There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals like-minded to the offender who, but for such deterrence, would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which the offender is being sentenced. Finally there is a component of deterrence to be considered personal to the offender with a view to deterring him from re-offending. It will be noted when I come to the actual sentences that I have had that fact very much in mind. Concurrent Sentences186 Although the robbery offence that I. D. is charged with differs significantly in its criminality from the sexual assault offences, I intend to deal with all offences concurrently. I noted that when dealing with O. N. for the tenth offence I shall be taking into account his break and enter and robbery in that sentence. Consequently, to the extent that parity of approach should be applied, the robbery and the sexual assault offences will receive concurrent sentences.Parity187 I have referred to the greater role O. N. played in the sexual offending. That greater role must be reflected in the sentences imposed. The issue of parity is also blurred because of the robbery offence which is the first offence with I. D.’s indictment and is equated to a Form 1 offence of break, enter and steal with robbery, and I am taking that offence into account when I sentence O. N. for the last offence in the indictment.Form 1 Matters188 There is a proper approach to Form 1 matters which has been espoused by the Chief Justice in the Court of Criminal Appeal guideline case. The Chief Justice, speaking for that Court on the proper approach to Form 1 matters made clear the rationale for the increase in penalty. He said: 
     
      
      The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which … are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence…

       (2004) 61 NSWLR 305. 
      
    Totality189 Because all sentences served by each offender will have the same commencement date it will be necessary when setting the sentences for his offences to take into account totality. Particularly must this be so for what I might call the headliner offence. That is in the number ten offence of I D and the number eight and eleven offence for O N. S 19 of the Children’s (Criminal Procedure) Act 190 The penalties for the headline offences, even when discounted for the pleas of guilty will be substantial. They will continue on after each offender is over twenty-one. The offenders' better prospects for rehabilitation is to be found within the juvenile justice systems where, (a) there is a greater focus of resources on rehabilitation programs and a rehabilitation milieu, that is attitude, ambience, and (b) the other inmates are also still in their formative years and are less likely to corrupt or divert the rehabilitation plans of these two offenders than each would encounter if he went in to adult custody.191 For these reasons I intend to direct the non-parole period of these sentences be served as juvenile offenders. I note the effect of the order will be that each person will be committed to a detention centre, see s 19(6) of the Childrens (Criminal Proceedings) Act.Special Circumstances 192 I am proposing to find special circumstances. My basis for making the finding is the youth of each offender and applying the remarks referred to earlier by Justice Hunt. Each offender was under seventeen when these offences were committed. For I D it will be his first time in custody. For O. N. it is his second time in custody but this custody will be much longer than the previous. Parole will not be automatic because the sentences imposed on the headliner offences are longer than three years. Parole therefore will have to be earned. A Board will sit to determine whether you will be eligible for parole. That Board will look at the progress that you make whilst you are in custody. Thus I intend special circumstances to motivate each of you to work towards securing your parole and thereby avoid adult prison. 193 Finally, the order that I will make will require that the balance of term will be served in adult prison. If you do not make parole the transfer will occur and you will be moved to adult prison. This should encourage you both to attend to your rehabilitation whilst in custody. It should also be a powerful personal deterrence for you once released, because when you are, if it be the case, in breach of your parole, it is unto adult custody you will be placed.Formal Orders194 O. N. I convict you of each and every one of the offences on the indictment. I will read but one of them but understand this conviction applies to all eleven. I convict you of the offence that you on 6 March 2005 at Lakemba being in company with I. D. had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent knowing that she was not consenting and immediately before that sexual intercourse threatened to inflict actual bodily harm upon her by means of an offensive weapon, namely the handgun.195 I am going to sentence you for the most serious offence first and then come down the scale. I take into account all of the matters of the two Form 1s that you have asked me to take into account. But for your plea of guilty I would have sentenced you to sixteen years. I reduce that by twenty-five per cent. That will make an overall sentence of twelve years’ imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four years, two months and eighteen days to commence on 3 April 2005 when you first went into custody and to expire, if my maths be correct, on 21 June 2009, which should be the day before your twenty-first birthday. 196 I note the Crown sought a commencement date of 28 June when you were arrested. The date of your arrest depended upon matters extraneous to your custody, such as the availability of police and whether you were or were not available for them, for instance whether you were at court or some other place. In those circumstances an arrest date seems an arbitrary date upon which to fix the commencement of a sentence. In your case your arrest was within two and a half months of being in custody. Arbitrary dates are not always so kind. Arbitrary dates such as those in circumstances where an offender is in custody do not present as a good sentencing policy. It is different of course when a person is at liberty. In those circumstances the arrest marks the commencement of their custody. In your case it does not.197 I set a balance of term to expire on 3 April 2017. That equates to a balance of term of seven years, nine months and twelve days. I have acknowledged already once that my maths is bad, but it is my intention that the overall sentence will be one of twelve years.198 As to count 8 but for your plea of guilty I would have set a sentence of fifteen years. They will all be less than the first one. That is discounted by twenty-five per cent and becomes one overall sentence of eleven years three months. I set a non-parole period again of four years, two months and eighteen days to commence on 3 April 2005 and to expire on 21 June 2009. The balance of term commences on 26 June 2009 and expires, on my calculation, 2 July 2016. 199 On counts 2, 3 and 6, which were the penile penetration counts but for your plea of guilty I would have sentenced you to eight years. Taking into account the discount it becomes six years. I set a non-parole period of four years to date from 3 April 2005 and to expire on 2 April 2009. The balance of term if my add-ups are correct will expire on 2 April 2011.200 On counts 1, 5, 7 and 10, they are the oral sex counts of fellatio, but for your plea of guilty I would have sentenced you to six years. When I apply the twenty-five per cent it becomes four and a half years. I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 3 April 2005 and to expire on 2 April 2008. Your balance of term is eighteen months, will expire on 2 October 2009.201 Finally for counts 4 and 9, being in company with your co-offender when he committed the fellatio on the victim I would have sentenced you to two years for those, I have reduced that by twenty-five per cent to one and a half years. I make that a fixed term. That sentence has expired. It expired on 2 October last year.202 That completes the sentencing against you and so that you can understand, if you work and achieve your parole you will be released the day before your twenty-first birthday. If you don’t achieve your parole you will be moved to adult prison to continue your sentence.203 Before I deal with the next one Mr Crown, Mr Keenan it is my understanding that Juvenile Justice will keep this offender six weeks after his twenty-first birthday. The sentence that I impose is based on that assumption. If it is wrong I will regard it as an error, I do not intend at this stage to endorse the indictment for the moment and I will in the event backdate the sentence to his birthday.204 The reason that I need the six weeks is to complete the non-parole period I desire to give him.205 I. D. in your case I need to read out two charges and in so doing you will be convicted of three. The first charge is the robbery charge and I am going to read that out and convict you of it.206 You are convicted of the offence that you on 6 March at Lakemba entered the dwelling house in Ernest Street and committed a serious indictable offence, namely robbery in circumstances of aggravation, in that you were in the company of O. N. and in circumstances of further aggravation, namely you were armed with an offensive weapon, namely the handgun, and you then broke out.207 You are also convicted of both of the sexual assault offences, but I will only read one out for the formal purposes of convicting you. I convict you of the offence that you on 6 March at Lakemba in the State of New South Wales being in the company of O. N. had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing she was not consenting and immediately before the sexual intercourse threatened to commit actual bodily harm on her and her son by means of an offensive weapon, namely a handgun.208 For the robbery and the breakout sentence but for your plea of guilty I would have sentenced you to a sentence of six years. When I apply the seventeen and a half per cent discount for that it becomes a sentence of four years and eleven months. I set a non-parole period 3 years to date from the day you first went into custody, 21 June 2005. That sentence will expire on 20 June 2008. I set a balance of term of one year and eleven months which will expire on 20 May 2010.209 For the first fellatio that you did on your own I convict you. Likewise for that offence I would have sentenced you to a sentence of six years, but for your plea I have reduced that by thirteen months, making again the sentence of four years and eleven months. Again I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 21 June 2005 and to expire on 20 June 2008. I set a balance of term of one year eleven months to expire on 20 May 2010.210 I am now going to sentence you for the joint sexual assault offence. Your involvement was expressed in terms of fellatio. But for your plea of guilty I would have sentenced you for that offence for twelve years’ imprisonment. Giving you the discount of seventeen and a half per cent for your plea that amounts to two years and one month which makes the overall sentence one of nine years and eleven months. I set a non-parole period of four years. That non-parole period will expire on 20 June 2009, coincidentally the day before your co-offender’s, but if I have got my maths correct it should be the day before your twenty-first birthday, is that right?OFFENDER: Not correct your Honour, I turn 21 on 15 May.HIS HONOUR: That’s right, but you will be kept in custody because of the six weeks. If they cannot do that at Juvenile Detention you are coming back and I am going to backdate the sentence. It is my intention that you will remain in juvenile custody but you will do four years if I can possibly get it. If I cannot get it my paramount concern is that you do not go to adult custody.211 I want to make it clear that I have set the non-parole period understanding Juvenile Justice will, in the light of my order, retain in custody this offender for the additional six weeks after his twenty-first birthday. If that be not correct because I have misunderstood the situation I will backdate the sentence starting it from a date before you were in custody. I set a balance of term of five years eleven months to expire on 20 May 2015. 212 I expect the parties to notify me within seven days if I am incorrect in my assumption. Because any correction that I do must be done immediately.

    1. HIS HONOUR: Stephen James Lesslie originally came for trial before me on 11 December 2006 for a series of offences, five of them, and to that indictment he pleaded not guilty.2. The circumstances of the case, as I have indicated already, were really quite deplorable. A young girl, who was the complainant in the matter, was interviewed by a police officer who lost her interview. Then a year went by and another police officer eventually interviewed her and then a number of years went by before anything was done to bring Mr Lesslie to court. All this, no doubt, put enormous strain on the young complainant and the fact that the original interview was lost had meant severe problems for the Crown in the conduct of the case.3. The complainant gave some evidence. She was clearly very upset and, believably, more than a little confused as a result of the very poor treatment she got on the part of the New South Wales Police who were supposed to be investigating her case. I hasten to say that the conduct of the police cannot be brought to bear on Mr Lesslie. There is no suggestion that he had anything to do with the police ineptitude.4. I have read the victim impact statement. It is a very, very sad statement and I can say it brought a tear to my eye. 5. I think it has to be said that even without this victim impact statement that any young child who is the subject of any form of abuse at the hands of an adult in whose care she is affected very seriously by it. The abuse can be something of this nature; rubbing her body outside her clothing near her vagina area; it can be inappropriate kissing or touching. It amounts to an invasion of privacy and creates enormous confusion in the mind of a child and other people. There is no doubt that any person who is placed in a position of this young lady would feel terribly victimised and terribly upset. I have read her statement. It is a very sad one and what it says reflects what I have just said.6. The fact that she has given me this statement does not mean, of course, that I increase the sentence on Mr Lesslie, because the sentence imposed on him would apply whether he caused this terrible emotional upset or not. 7. As a matter of fact, it would seem that he has. His counsel has conceded that in a case like this, this is almost the situation and I agree with that. 8. It is essentially an incident which serious breach of trust. Most offences involving indecent assaults on children are committed by people who know the children. 9. Contrary to the mythology of some television shows, strangers do not wander around the streets snatching children so much as friends and relatives and people they know abuse them; people in whom they place their trust. 10. So, I can only say to the complainant here that I am very sorry for what happened to her and it is most unacceptable that a series of matters like this could be investigated like this in such a poor fashion. I have myself separately made my own representations to the relevant authorities about the unsatisfactory nature of this investigation. Again, that has nothing to do with Mr Lesslie and nothing to do with any sentence that could be imposed on him. It has to do with my being dissatisfied with the poor conduct of those investigating serious offences.11. He has pleaded guilty to one matter. The Crown has accepted that plea. The prosecutor told me that he had consulted with the complainant before accepting that plea. Mr Lesslie must be sentenced on the basis of the facts that are agreed and the facts agreed as to the one matter to which he pleaded guilty.12. In court today, during the course of giving evidence, he has expressed his remorse and he has said that he was very much affected by the distress suffered by this young lady and that is why he pleaded guilty. He says he does not specifically remember what happened, but because of her upset he came to the conclusion that she must be telling the truth. He described himself as being, ""the scum of the earth."" 13. I can only say that he is one of the very few people who has come before me on any offence like this who has been prepared to accept responsibility and to express true contrition. Very many people charged with this offence express no contribution and claim to have done nothing. The fact that he has done that is a matter that must be taken into account in his favour.14. Evidence shows that he cares for four of his own children and the Department of Community Services investigated those arrangements and is satisfied with them. As he has pleaded guilty to a child sex offence he has to be registered under the appropriate legislation and that will bar him from having contact with other children.15. Evidence also establishes that he has a couple of quite serious illnesses. He does have criminal antecedents, but they are, in the main, not of a very relevant nature.16. He is a volunteer bush fire fighter, which indicates he is prepared to do something for the community. 17. It is clear that indecent assaults are various in nature. Those that involve rubbing around the vaginal area are more serious than, say, an inappropriate kissing or a touching near the breasts. However, they are also less serious than an attempt to penetrate from underneath the clothing.18. In my opinion this is a matter which can best be dealt with by way of placing him on a bond under S 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a period of five years and to place him under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service for as long as that Service thinks necessary. They have investigated his living arrangements and other aspects of his life and if they think it is not important to continue supervision, they can discontinue that supervision. They can refer him to certain programmes and he is obliged to attend those programmes. 19. It is not a case where I should impose a sentence of imprisonment. 20. Of course, if he had been convicted on the major offences that would be a different matter. But, he has not been convicted on those major offences. He has pleaded guilty to one offence and one offence only and that is what I must sentence him on.21. So, I sentence the offender to enter into a bond pursuant to S 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for a period of five years that bond will go from today, 2 February, 2007, and will go to 1 February, 2012.22. It is a condition of the bond that he places himself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and undertakes such programmes as that Service considers necessary. The Service may terminate its supervision at any time. He is to report to the officer in charge of that Service at Taree within seven days of today.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging that on 11 April 2001 at Hornsby in the State of New South Wales he supplied a prohibited drug, namely 24.4 kg of cocaine, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity of that drug, contrary to s 33(3)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for the offence is life imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of six years nine months commencing on 30 January 2004 and a balance of term of two years six months. This amounts to an effective total sentence of nine years three months. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    3 A statement of the relevant facts was tendered and adopted by the sentencing judge. It reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""On 7 January 2001 a joint strike force led by the Drug Squad, State Crime Command with the AFP, commenced into the alleged large commercial quantity of cocaine within the Sydney area. 
         
         
        On 2 February, 2001, the defendant has arranged and paid for the formation of an Australian listed company called Impex Australia Pty Limited to facilitate the importation of a number of black plastic floor crates from South Africa. 
        
       
       
        
        On 8 March 2001, approximately 580 single units of black modular flooring has entered the Botany terminal and under instructions of the defendant, other known persons have facilitated its transportation to shed 15, 8 Hargrave Street, Tamworth 
        
       
       
        
        This being a storage shed leased by the defendant for the purpose of unpacking and storing the flooring. 
        
       
       
        
        On 11 March 2001, two further known persons have entered Australia via Sydney and travelled to Tamworth where they were met by the defendant at Tamworth Airport. 
        
       
       
        
        On 14 March 2001, the shipment of flooring has been delivered to the shed 15, 8 Hargrave Street, Tamworth, where it was unpacked by the defendant and the two known persons. 
        
       
       
        
        On 17 March 2001, the defendant and two known persons have travelled from Tamworth to the Kennards self storage facility, 105 Pacific Highway, Hornsby. At the time the defendant has enquired about the lease of a storage shed. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant has completed the rental agreement and provided his details and South African driver's licence as identification. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant has paid cash for one month's rental and purchased a lock with two keys to the unit. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant has retained one of these keys and the pin number and supplied another  
        key 
         to the two known persons. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant and two known persons have then travelled back to Tamworth. 
        
       
       
        
        On 23 March 2001, the two known persons have returned to the Kennards self storage facility, 105 Pacific Highway, Hornsby, and completed an authority to break lock for unit M 72. 
        
       
       
        
        The two known persons have then with the assistance of staff removed the lock and after being left alone placed a new lock on to the storage unit. The two known defendants have then returned to the Tamworth area and returned the key for the Hargrave Street storage shed to a hotel for return to the defendant 
        
       
       
        
        On 30 March 2001, the two known persons have left Australia via Sydney. 
        
       
       
        
        On 11 April 2001, the defendant has contacted  
        one of  
        the known persons in the US via his mobile phone. 
        
       
       
        
        On 19 April 2001, the defendant has then contacted the Kennards self storage complex and advised them that he wished to pay for an additional month's rent for unit M 72 using his visa card and that he needed a new pin for access to  
        the  
        storage unit. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant was advised that a pin could not be sent but that the payment could be accepted. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant further stated that he had two agents coming over to the unit. 
        
       
       
        
        On 23 April 2001, the defendant's mobile phone was subject to a lawfully obtained telephone interception. 
        
       
       
        
        At 7.38am on 24 April 2001, the defendant contacted a known relative in which they stated, `Dennis (one of the known persons) is in any case, um apparently um there. He um signed over the facility and put another lock on and so on. So I don't know what's going on there.' 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant stated, `No well I don't know about that, you know, so I’m going to arrive and just try my own key and if it doesn’t work, then say to the people, what now? You know.' 
        
       
       
        
        At 3.16pm on Thursday 26 April 2001 the defendant's mobile phone has been subject to lawful interception in which the defendant had a further conversation with a known relative in relation to instructions for what the defendant should say and do in relation to the Hornsby storage shed. 
        
       
       
        
        At the completion of the telephone call the defendant expresses his desire to not talk on the phone any further and that he will communicate via email. 
        
       
       
        
        On 27 April 2001, police from the drug squad and APP have executed a search warrant on 79 Harrier Parade, Tamworth, the residence of the defendant. During this search during this time a search of the premises was conducted in the presence of the defendant and recorded on video. During this time a number of items were located including $32,800 in Australian currency. 
        
       
       
        
        At 10am in company with the defendant a further search warrant was executed at shed 15 8 Hargrave Street, Tamworth in which a further 577 pieces of black modular flooring were located, a mop, a number of cleaning products and a sheet of plastic attached to the window with, grey electrical tape. 
        
       
       
        
        At 1.18pm the defendant was cautioned and participated in an ERISP in which the defendant stated that he had commenced a business in Australia for the importation of the modular flooring for the purpose of selling for profit. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant further stated that due to his busy employment he had been unable to conduct any market research, but that he intended to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant further stated that the two known persons had travelled from the USA to assist in the marketing of the flooring but had not completed in any such activity. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant stated that he was undertaking the business on behalf of the known relative. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant was then shown the authority to break padlock for unit M 72 in which he stated that he was unaware of the lock being broken and had no explanation for it. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant further stated that the $32,800 in cash was part of . $100,000 in cash brought into Australia by the unknown relative in January 2001, This being part payment for a previous debt. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant stated that the $32,800 was all that remained after purchasing a motor vehicle and other expenses. 
        
       
       
        
        At 7.09pm a further lawfully intercepted telephone call was obtained in which the defendant contacted the known relative and informed them of the search warrant by police. During this conversation the defendant speaks to the known relative about the explanation given to police in relation to the money seized. 
        
       
       
        
        At 9.18am on 28 April 2001 the defendant contacts one of the two known persons and informed them of the search warrant conducted by police. 
        
       
       
        
        During this call the defendant is advised not to talk on the phone and call on a pay phone. The defendant agrees. 
        
       
       
        
        On 3 May 2001 at gam a further search warrant is executed on 15 8 Hargrave Street, Tamworth where a number of scientific analyses were completed, and all items removed. 
        
       
       
        
        On 3 May 2001 at 2.47pm the defendant again contacts the known relative and has a conversation in relation to the actions of police. The defendant specifically advises about the police removing all items including the wooden pallets. The known relative shows considerable concern about this, and states `But, but, clean wood, proper wood.' The defendant stated, `Yes hopefully.' 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant had a further conversation in relation to changing his explanation about the source of the money seized, and coached as to his explanation to be offered to police on how the money was obtained. 
        
       
       
        
        At 3.54pm the defendant participated in a second ERSP in which he stated that he bought the $60,000 into Australia himself as part of a pension pay out and that he was aware of his obligation to report such amounts entering Australia. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant again denied any knowledge of the cocaine located. On 15 January 2002 after further extensive enquiries by the drug squad, police attended the British Aerospace Section, Tamworth Airport, and at 1.06pm the defendant was informed of his arrest and conveyed to Tamworth Police Station. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant was cautioned and participated in an ERISP. He stated that approximately one to two weeks after receiving delivery of the modular flooring, he had it placed in the Tamworth self storage unit. He then began the lease for the storage shed at Hornsby. He then received a phone call from each of the both known persons, who informed him that a large amount of cocaine had been located in his storage shed. He was advised by one of the known persons to leave Australia. The defendant states that he was extremely concerned about these calls and immediately contacted his girlfriend and arranged for her to fly to Sydney where he would meet with her. The defendant states he discussed his concerns with his girlfriend about the calls and the apparent location of the drugs in the unit at Hornsby. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant further stated that although concerned enough to fly to Sydney, he did not feel concerned enough to travel to Hornsby, or contact the police, or make any enquiries to confirm the information. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant further stated, that although he was the only person in Australia with access to the storage shed at Hornsby, he made no attempt to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant further stated that the reason he obtained the storage shed in Hornsby, was to allow for the showing of the modular flooring to prospective customers, although he had no knowledge of the brand, the cost price, the manufacturer, guarantee or warranty, import costs, competition or whether the flooring was even new or second hand. The defendant further stated that he had in fact made no sales, or contacted any persons in relation to the sale of the items. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant further stated that he had made no attempt to obtain contact details from the two known persons, although he believed them to be in Australia prior for the purpose of developing a market, and having been previously involved in the selling of the products. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant was questioned in relation to the expenses of establishing the business to which he replied that one of the known persons had attended Australia and handed him $10,000 in cash for expenses. This being something the defendant had not revealed in the two previous interviews. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant was questioned in relation to the lawfully obtained telephone intercept in which he was unable to provide answers for the inconsistencies in his previous interviews. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant was charged with the matters now before the Court."" 
        
       
      
    4 The applicant gave oral evidence on more than one occasion before the sentencing judge. His Honour found that in statements which he had made to the police, which included denials of his involvement, he gave “various versions of events with the clear intention to mislead and deceive.” His Honour found that the applicant told numerous lies and provided accounts minimising his involvement and supplying exculpatory descriptions of his activities including a false explanation as to how he came to possess significant money sums. 
     
      
    5 In a statement which his Honour described as his “final statement”, made two years after his arrest, the applicant presented a scenario which was different to that which had previously been provided to the police. However, his Honour concluded that it was not possible to find that even this final statement represented “an honest, full and accurate version of what had occurred.” Having observed the applicant his Honour was not persuaded that he was a truthful witness. 
     
      
    6 His Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before me, it appears as though he has attempted to adhere as closely as he could to his final version to police.  
        
       
       
        
        He presented a highly unlikely account of an agreement between himself and his brother Jacobis to import industrial flooring into Australia. At no point in the prisoner’s evidence as to the alleged scope of the importation of industrial flooring and as to how it was to be financed and marketed did he provide a sensible and credible explanation. The prisoner described the formation of a company Impex Australia Pty Ltd to facilitate the importation of industrial flooring. He claimed that he had been told by his brother that two persons Dennis and Gorgy [sic], would assist him with the unloading of that flooring.  
        
       
       
        
        It had been his intention to move to Tamworth to live, and for reasons for which no convincing explanation is advanced, it was decided to transport the flooring to Tamworth after it was landed in Sydney. To this end, he rented premises in that centre.  
        
       
       
        
        He claimed that only on the day prior to flooring arriving in Tamworth was he informed by Dennis and Gorgy [sic] that there were drugs contained within the flooring and its packaging. 
        
       
       
        
        I simply do not believe that he was not well aware of the presence of the drugs long before this.  
        
       
       
        
        It is impossible to accept that the prisoner had any genuine belief that the timber flooring was to be marketed in Australia, as a bona fide operation. No sales persons had ever been engaged, no advertising had been arranged, no facility to demonstrate the product at Tamworth. There were no details of pricing, anticipated profits, landed cost of the timber, how it was to be sold or distributed.  
        
       
       
        
        Apparently the proposed method of attracting customers, if the prisoner is to be accepted, was to have the storage shed at Kennards storage depot at Hornsby where a number of pieces of timber would be available for inspection. It is a mystery to me as to who the prospective customers would be and how they would ever be attracted to a storage shed 1.8 metres x 1.5 metres x 1.4 metres. No sensible explanation was offered as to how prospective customers were to be informed of the whereabouts and qualities of the flooring. 
        
       
       
        
        On his account Mr Coetzee was aware eighty-four kilos of cocaine had been imported into Australia. He, of course, is charged with an offence involving but 24.4 kilos of that drug and will be dealt with on that basis. 
        
       
       
        
        A former colonel in the South African Air Force, he was certainly not an unsophisticated, ill-educated man. He either was aware at all times of the importation, as I believe, or if his version is accepted, he was told shortly before or at the time the drugs arrived at Tamworth. 
        
       
       
        
        That consignment of cocaine was worth a small fortune involving millions of dollars, yet the prisoner would have me believe that there was at the same time a genuine commercial operation on foot, selling industrial flooring. He had no qualification or expertise in this field, and it is ludicrous to expect his companions would have engaged in such unplanned, unorganised venture which may or may not result in any profit. 
        
       
       
        
        Having regard to the undoubted vast amounts to be made in selling the cocaine, I have not the slightest doubt that the importation of the flooring was to the prisoner’s knowledge, but a device to disguise the drug importation. 
        
       
       
        
        I make mention of these matters only to demonstrate my complete scepticism as to the reliability of the prisoner’s final account to the police and of his explanations given before me. This is relevant on the question of any remorse or contrition.” 
        
       
      
    7 His Honour went on to express his further scepticism about the applicant’s account that he was surprised to receive the sum of $130,000 which the applicant said was thrust upon him by Gorby with the explanation “this is for helping us around Sydney.” His Honour found, holding “no doubt” about the matter, that the applicant had full knowledge that a substantial quantity of cocaine had been imported into Australia contained within the pallets and packing associated with the flooring. His Honour also found that the applicant was fully aware that compressed cocaine had been placed in the storage unit at Hornsby where it was located by the police. 
     
      
    8 His Honour also rejected any suggestion that the actions of the applicant were influenced by any threats or duress and rejected any suggestion that his conduct resulted from coercion or deception which had been practised upon him. Although the applicant had claimed to a probation officer that he was unaware that the goods imported contained illegal drugs, his Honour rejected this assertion. His Honour also rejected the proposition advanced to a probation service interviewer that the reason for his failure to report the presence of the drugs, was because of threats of harm to himself and family in Africa, should he contact the police or compromise the illegal activity in any way. 
     
      
    9 His Honour said that the complications with the applicant’s evidence made it impossible to accurately categorise his status in the hierarchy of the criminal activity. However, his Honour found that he was not some minor functionary in an insignificant position. His Honour found that his participation was central and vital to the success of the scheme. He had arranged the formation of a company to facilitate the importation. Although his Honour did not find that the applicant was responsible for financing the purchase of the cocaine, he nevertheless, concluded that he would have benefited financially in a significant manner from a successful operation. 
     
      
    10 His Honour determined that by reason of the size of the criminal activity and the prospect of profits it was important to impose a sentence which reflected the need for deterrence, protection of the public and provided appropriate punishment for the applicant.  
     
      
    11 The applicant had a career as a pilot and flying instructor and his business activities reflect a sophisticated and intelligent person. His Honour found that he was fully aware of the devastating effects of the availability of 24.4 kg of cocaine within the community. Finding that cocaine is a highly dangerous drug, his Honour concluded that the quantity involved in the activity had the potential to corrupt and destroy many people. 
     
      
    12 His Honour also had access to a pre-sentence report which set out the relevant subjective matters. The applicant was born in South Africa, the eldest in a family of three children. He was brought up in a supportive environment free of significant material or other deprivation. However, his father was killed in a motor vehicle accident in 1992 when the applicant was driving the vehicle. The applicant has been married and divorced on two occasions and has two children aged fourteen and eighteen at the time of sentence who live with their mother in South Africa. He again became engaged in March 2003 and at the time of sentence his fiancée continued to be supportive of him. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was employed directly from school by the South African Air Force. He served as an Air Force pilot for in excess of twenty-three years. After leaving the Air Force he set up a debt recovery business with his brother. 
     
      
    14 He came to Australia to work for BAE Systems, as a flying instructor after seeing an advertisement in a local newspaper. Initially that employment required him to live in South Australia, largely at his expense, while learning and obtaining Australian civilian aviation qualifications. He then moved to Tamworth with the BAE Systems College situated at the airport. 
     
      
    15 His Honour found that there was nothing in his background by way of physical or psychological disability or drugs, which would explain his conduct. His Honour was satisfied that the applicant was motivated by greed. The applicant had a previously unblemished record. Letters from his family and former Air Force colleagues described a series of impressive achievements as a career pilot and instructor. He was well regarded in the South African Air Force and held many responsible positions. He received a variety of merit awards and decorations. His Honour concluded that the reports of his time in custody indicated impressive efforts on the applicant’s behalf to rehabilitate himself.  
     
      
    16 His Honour found that the applicant’s plea of guilty was not entered at the earliest opportunity, but, nevertheless at an early stage and had utilitarian value, in that it saved the community the cost of a trial and relieved the pressures on the resources of the trial court. His Honour determined that a discount of 15% was appropriate. 
     
      
    17 There was a delay of 15 months between when the applicant entered his plea of guilty and when he was sentenced. This delay was in part due to difficulties in the sentencing judge being available at convenient times. However, it was also significantly due to the applicant seeking to have his sentence hearing deferred in the expectation that if he cooperated with the authorities in the prosecution of others involved in the enterprise, he may receive more favourable consideration. His Honour found that in reality the prospect of a prosecution of others eventuating was unrealistic and any expectation that the applicant could have given relevant assistance to authorities was misplaced. 
     
      
    18 The applicant advanced ten grounds of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground A: The learned sentencing judge erred by finding that the applicant was aware of the fact that cocaine would be imported into Australia. 
       
       
      Ground B: The learned sentencing judge erred by finding that the applicant was a major player in the criminal enterprise. 
       
      
    19 The applicant dealt with grounds A and B together. His version was that he embarked upon a venture in relation to the importation of industrial flooring and belatedly became aware of the existence of cocaine the day prior to its arrival in Tamworth. He thereafter said his involvement resulted from fear and implied threats. On his account there was little which he did to justify the payment of $130,000 that was made to him. 
     
      
    20 He also said that even when he became aware of the cocaine, he still believed that the industrial flooring project was a bona fide operation. He said he held that belief notwithstanding that there were no sales, no advertising, no facilities to demonstrate the product, no knowledge of landed costs, pricing or how the product could be marketed or distributed. 
     
      
    21 In his submissions to this Court the applicant challenged the factual findings made by his Honour. It was submitted that his Honour erred both in rejecting the applicant’s evidence and having regard to the other surrounding evidence should have concluded that the applicant was not knowingly involved in the importation of the cocaine and only had a minor role in the enterprise. It was submitted that his Honour had erred by rejecting the applicant’s evidence and, without evidence, concluding that the applicant had a significant role in the criminal activity. 
     
      
    22 In my view, the findings which his Honour made were clearly open and correct. It is important to appreciate that the applicant was not charged with importing cocaine. Rather, he was charged with supplying a large commercial quantity of the drug. His Honour found that he was either aware at all times of the importation, or was told about it shortly before or at the time the drugs arrived in Tamworth. His Honour was entitled, in my view, to reject the suggestion made by the applicant that he had become unexpectedly entangled in the enterprise and was then unable to extricate himself because of threats, implied or otherwise. 
     
      
    23 The evidence which I have previously related leads inevitably to the conclusion that the flooring importation exercise was not genuine and was never intended to be genuine. The inevitable conclusion is that the enterprise was always comprised of a major cocaine importation and distribution operation. The timber venture was, as his Honour found, devised in order to provide a cover for the drug distribution operation. Whether or not the applicant was aware that drugs were to be imported before they arrived is not significant. His role in the proposed distribution was an important one. He formed the necessary company and was instrumental in organising the activities in Sydney. His Honour was entitled to sentence him as a major player in the distribution enterprise. 
     
      
       
      Ground C: The learned sentencing judge erred by not finding that the applicant was threatened and had acted partially out of fear. 
       
      
    24 His Honour emphatically rejected the applicant’s suggestion that his conduct resulted from coercion or deception. He concluded that his real motivation was greed. 
     
      
    25 His Honour had the opportunity of assessing the applicant when he gave evidence on 7 June and 24 March 2005. It was clearly open to his Honour to disbelieve the applicant in relation to his suggestion of coercion or deception. No error has been shown in his Honour’s conclusion. 
     
      
       
      Ground D: The learned sentencing judge erred by finding that the applicant did not have any remorse or contrition. 
       
      
    26 The sentencing judge found that the applicant’s version of the relevant events should not be accepted and was accordingly sceptical as to the applicant’s assertion of remorse. It was submitted that in this respect his Honour was in error. In support of this submission, it was emphasised that the applicant pleaded guilty at an early stage, had offered assistance to the authorities within days of his arrest, expressed his remorse to Ms Carroll and continued to express it in court. He also expressed regret for his actions to officers of the Probation and Parole Service. In these circumstances, it was submitted that his Honour should have found that the applicant demonstrated deep remorse for his actions. 
     
      
    27 In my opinion his Honour was correct to be sceptical in these matters. I am satisfied that his Honour’s finding, that the applicant had not been truthful in relating his part in the criminal enterprise was both open and appropriate. It was open to his Honour to reject the applicant’s submission that he had demonstrated remorse and no error has been revealed.  
     
      
       
      Ground E: In the light of the wrong factual basis upon which the applicant was sentenced, the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    28 The applicant was sentenced to a head sentence of 9 years and 3 months. He submitted that this sentence was manifestly excessive but acknowledges that a head sentence of 8 years would have been within the appropriate range based upon the factual findings advanced in the submissions. 
     
      
    29 His Honour found that the applicant played a central role in the criminal enterprise which had as its objective the distribution of a very substantial quantity of cocaine. This made a sentence comprised of a substantial gaol term inevitable. The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Even allowing for the fact that his Honour provided a 15% discount for the plea of guilty, the sentence which was imposed was, in my opinion, well within the appropriate range. 
     
      
       
      Ground F: The learned sentencing judge erred by finding that the applicant had not given assistance to the authorities and as a result thereof was not entitled to any discount for assistance. 
       
      
    30 The applicant had the onus of establishing an entitlement to have his sentence mitigated by reason of assistance to the authorities. The usefulness of the assistance is a significant consideration: R v Yenice (1994) 72 A Crim R 234. 
     
      
    31 Although the applicant offered to give evidence against the persons said to be involved in the enterprise he had initially distanced himself from the crime. He made a statement in which he insisted that he had acted under duress and, notwithstanding his knowledge of the cocaine, he believed that he was involved in a legitimate business venture. If, as the sentencing judge found, these assertions were untrue, his statement was otherewise confirmatory of what the police already knew. It provided no basis for laying charges or commencing extradition proceedings against the others who were involved in the enterprise and were residing overseas. 
     
      
    32 The applicant offered to assist the authorities by obtaining the cooperation of his brother who was involved in the enterprise. However, this offer was conditional upon immunity from prosecution being provided for his brother. The Commonwealth DPP refused the request for immunity and ultimately concluded that the suggested assistance not genuine. 
     
      
    33 In relation to the suggestion that the applicant may give evidence against the other participants in the criminal enterprise, the evidence does not indicate that there was any real prospect that they would be brought to Australia and tried for the offences. Accordingly, although the offer was made, in my opinion his Honour was correct to assess it as having no utility and accordingly it was not relevant to the ultimate sentencing exercise. 
     
      
       
      Ground G: The learned sentencing judge erred by not giving the applicant a discount for the early plea of guilty 
       
      
    34 The sentencing judge determined that a discount of 15% was appropriate for the applicant’s plea. The applicant contended that a greater discount should have been afforded and submitted that the plea was made at the earliest opportunity rather than, as his Honour determined, at an early opportunity. 
     
      
    35 The applicant was charged on 15 January 2003 and entered his plea in June 2003 after a full brief had been served on him. The applicant submitted that this was the earliest opportunity for him to enter a plea.  
     
      
    36 The applicant was first interviewed in relation to this offence in April 2001 and denied any responsibility until 17 January 2003. After he had made his plea he attempted to withdraw it in the District Court but that application was ultimately abandoned. 
     
      
    37 In these circumstances, in my opinion, although the applicant’s plea should be considered as early, he was not entitled to the maximum discount. In my opinion, a discount of 15% was within the appropriate range and no error is revealed: see R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
       
      Ground H: the learned sentencing judge erred by failing to find special circumstances justifying a major variation from the ratio prescribed by s 44(2) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 between the term of the sentence and the non-parole period. 
       
      
    38 The applicant was sentenced pursuant to the sentencing regime applicable to offences committed before 1 February 2003. Accordingly s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 required that the non-parole period be not less than three-quarters of the head sentence unless there was a finding of special circumstances. The sentencing judge found special circumstances in the fact that it was the first time that the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment and accordingly stated that the ratio should be varied. 
     
      
    39 The sentence which was imposed provided a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months. If there had been no finding of special circumstances the non-parole period would have been 6 years and 11 months. Accordingly, the non-parole period imposed was 73% of the head sentence. 
     
      
    40 The applicant submitted that apart from the fact that this was his first time in prison the applicant’s prior good character, his age, and the progress which the applicant had made towards rehabilitation were matters which required a greater reduction in his non-parole period than the sentencing judge provided. 
     
      
    41 In response to this submission, the Crown emphasised that in written submissions made to the sentencing judge, the applicant’s counsel identified only the fact that it was the applicant’s first incarceration and the proffered assistance to authorities to justify a finding of special circumstances. The transcript confirms that this was the submission upon which his Honour was asked to sentence the applicant. In these circumstances, although the Crown accepts that the matters now raised may be relevant to special circumstances, because they were not advanced on this basis at the sentencing hearing, the Crown submitted they must have been taken into account when fixing the non-parole period and additional term. By asking this Court to again consider them and redetermine the appropriate non-parole would effectively be to “double dip.” 
     
      
    42 In my opinion the Crown’s submissions should be accepted. It must always be borne in mind that a finding of special circumstances and any reduction of the non-parole period is a discretionary matter. That decision will be informed by consideration of the non-parole period which adequately reflects the objective gravity of the offence (R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 [63]). Subjective circumstances may be relevant to the exercise of the discretion but they cannot be allowed to displace a non-parole period which is otherwise appropriate for the offence and the offender. Although in the present case his Honour provided only a modest variation of the standard non-parole period, I am not persuaded that his Honour’s discretion miscarried. This was a very serious offence and whatever be the applicant’s personal circumstances a non-parole period of six years and nine months could not be considered as beyond the appropriate range of sentence. 
     
      
       
      Ground I: the learned sentencing judge erred by failing to have proper regard to the applicant’s rehabilitation in setting the non-parole period. 
       
       
      Ground J: the learned sentencing judge erred by failing to take into account the 15 month delay between the applicant’s plea of guilty and the sentencing of the applicant. 
       
      
    43 The applicant dealt with these grounds together. Although there was a delay in sentencing the applicant this was not attributable to any action by the Crown. It was due, in part to the unavailability of the sentencing judge and more significantly, to the steps which were being taken to pursue the applicant’s offer of assistance to the authorities. The trial judge found that that offer was not genuine and was of no practical utility. The applicant conceded in this appeal that a large portion of the delay was the result of defence applications and not the fault of the Crown. 
     
      
    44 The applicant also emphasised that there was evidence indicating that he had taken advantage of the delay in the proceedings to achieve and demonstrate his rehabilitation or progress towards rehabilitation: In MRN v R (2006) NSWCCA 155 this Court accepted that where during their time in custody before sentence an offender has progressed towards rehabilitation it may be appropriate to ameliorate the offender’s sentence. The sentencing judge was mindful of the efforts which the applicant had made to rehabilitate himself and described them as impressive. In these circumstances it can be accepted that his Honour imposed a non-parole period which, notwithstanding the progress the applicant had made, his Honour considered to be appropriate. I do not consider that the sentence which his Honour imposed was otherwise than within the appropriate range, even having regard to that progress. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    45 In summary, I am not persuaded that the discretion of the sentencing judge has miscarried and although I would grant leave to appeal, I would, subject only to what appears below, dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    46 There is one further matter. Apparently, the applicant served an additional nine days in custody, which, because of a period he was on bail was overlooked when his sentence was imposed. He is entitled to have those days taken into account. The appropriate adjustment can be made if the appeal is upheld and the applicant resentenced and a sentence which commences nine days earlier is imposed. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    47 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
       
      2. Appeal allowed and the sentence quashed. 
       
      3. Sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of six years and nine months commencing on 21 January 2004 and expiring on 20 October 2010 and a total term of 9 years and 3 months expiring on 20 April 2013. The applicant is first eligible for parole on 21 October 2010.

     Richard John DARRIGO (aka Edwards) v Regina  
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Price J for the reasons given by him.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The applicant, Richard John Darrigo, seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court at Dubbo by Acting Judge Woods on 20 September 2005. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was charged with a single count of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He entered a plea of guilty to the offence in the Local Court on 8 June 2005 and confirmed his plea in the District Court. The sentencing judge imposed a term of imprisonment of 7 years to date from 23 March 2005 and expire on 22 March 2012 and set a non – parole period of 5 years to date from the commencement of the sentence and to expire on 22 March 2010. 
     
      
    5 An offence contrary to s 61M (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 10 years. A standard non – parole period has been prescribed (s 54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and table in Division 1A) in respect of the offence of five years imprisonment. 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal  
       
      
    6 The application for leave to appeal identified five grounds, namely: 
     
      
    Ground 1  
     
      
      The learned sentencing Judge erred in setting an excessive starting point of the sentence and allowing an inadequate discount for an early plea of guilty and erred in not expressly stating the starting point prior to taking into consideration any discount and in not quantifying the discount for the early plea of guilty. 
       
      
     Ground 2  
     
      
      The learned sentencing Judge erred in characterising the case as one where the maximum penalty should be considered and erred in his application of s 54B  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       by failing to apply the relevant considerations as stated in  
      R v Way 
       [2004] NSWCCA 131. 
       
      
     Ground 3 
     
      
      The learned sentencing Judge erred in his application of s 44  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       by expressly declining to find special circumstances and fixing a period of parole in a strictly sequential way. 
       
      
     Ground 4  
     
      
      The learned sentencing Judge erred in his application of s 21A  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       by inappropriately taking into account as an aggravating factor the applicant’s prior criminal record. 
       
      
     Ground 5 The sentence in all the circumstances is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
     The facts 
     
      
    7 An agreed statement of facts was placed before the Judge and may be conveniently summarised. On Wednesday 23 March 2005 the complainant then aged four years was in a Salvation Army Shop in Darling Street, Dubbo with her mother. Whilst the complainant was sitting on the floor playing with toys, the applicant entered the shop and appeared to be browsing through clothing items. The complainant was sitting just to the east of where the applicant was browsing. The applicant picked up a doll from a display and walked towards the complainant who was wearing a denim skirt that was cut above knee level and was sitting cross-legged. The applicant placed the doll on the complainant’s lap and at the same time placed his other hand under her skirt grabbing her around the vagina/buttock area. The applicant’s hand remained in that position until the complainant moved away. The applicant left the store immediately. The complainant complained to her mother who informed staff at the shop. Police were called and the applicant was identified from CCTV footage. When spoken to by police later in the day, the applicant admitted giving the doll to the child, but denied indecently assaulting her. He was charged by police and has been in custody since that time.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    8 Evidence of the applicant’s subjective circumstances was put before the Judge by way of a pre-sentence report, the report of a psychologist Mr Peter Ashkar and the oral evidence of the applicant himself. A psychological report prepared by the Department of Corrective Services was also tendered.  
     
      
    9 The applicant was born on 13 March 1950 and at the time of offending was aged 55 years. He is of Aboriginal descent and originally comes from Bourke. He has three brothers and four sisters. He was raised by both his grandmother and other family members, his parents having separated when he was very young. He experienced a difficult upbringing, with a disrupted family environment and left school early having completed year five or six. He had frequent placements in boys homes between the age of 13 and 16. 
     
      
    10 Evidence was given by the applicant of an incident whereby he was sexually assaulted when aged nine or ten years by a man aged about 30 years, a cousin of his father. The man placed his penis between the applicant’s buttocks. 
     
      
    11 The applicant was involved in a de facto relationship for 25 years, the relationship ending in 1994. He and his former partner have four children together (now all adults). At the time of the commission of the offence, the applicant had been working for a pet food manufacturing company for approximately nine months. Save for this employment he had been predominately unemployed with periods of seasonal work in rural industries.  
     
      
       
      Prior criminal history 
       
      
    12 The applicant has a lengthy criminal record as a juvenile and as an adult. The offences mainly consist of acts of dishonesty and driving offences. The applicant was first sentenced to terms of imprisonment when 18 years old for four counts of break, enter and steal. Of particular significance, however, are convictions in 1987 for two counts of commit an act of indecency with a person under the age of 16 years and in 1998 for four counts of indecent assault of a child under the age of ten years. More precisely, the record of convictions tendered to the Judge reveals that the applicant at the Nyngan District Court on 4 June 1987 was sentenced on the first count of commit act of indecency with a person under 16 years to a term of imprisonment for 2 years to date from 1.6.1987 and expire on 31.5.1992 (sic) and on the second count to a term of imprisonment for 3 years to date from 1.6.1987 and expire on 31.5.1990 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to date from 1.6.1987 and expire on 30.11.1989. 
     
      
    13 At the Cootamundra District Court on the 31 March 1998 the applicant was sentenced on two counts of indecent assault of a child under ten years to imprisonment on each count for 18 months to date from 15.2.1998 and expire on 14.8.1999. He was sentenced on a further two counts to a minimum term of 2 years to date from 15.8.1999 and expire on 14.8.2001 with an additional term of 2 years to date from 15.8.2001 and expire on 14.8.2003.  
     
      
    14 A statement of the facts of the offences for which he was sentenced in 1998 was tendered in the sentencing hearing before his Honour Acting Judge Woods. The offences by the applicant involved the indecent assault in 1994 and 1995 of the applicant’s cousin who was then aged about three or four years.  
     
      
    15 It is appropriate to note that at the time of the commission of the present offence, the applicant was subject to a s 9 bond for 12 months with supervision for the offence of mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol imposed on 18 October 2004.  
     
      
       
      Dealing with the Appeal  
       
      
    16 The first ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in setting too high a starting point and not allowing a sufficient discount for the early plea of guilty. The applicant further contends that the sentencing judge erred in not quantifying in percentage terms any discount for the early plea of guilty, nor did he indicate he was allowing any discount for the plea nor a starting point for the total sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    17 It is clear from the Judge’s remarks that he took the plea of guilty into account. His Honour, however, did not expressly refer to the fact that a discount was given for the plea nor did he quantify the value for it nor specify the starting point of the undiscounted sentence.  
     
      
    18 This Court continues to encourage sentencing judges to make the process of giving credit for pleas of guilty transparent: R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [162], R v Lynn [2004] NSWCCA 222 at [14], R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 [at 16] and [17]. As was said by Dunford J in R v Waqa (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 33 at [13]: 
     
      
       
        
        “13 The important consideration is to make the process of giving credit for pleas of guilty, assistance to the authorities etc, transparent:  
        R v Thomson 
         (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [162]. This is best achieved, in my opinion, by the judge specifying a notional starting point before specifying the discount or discounts allowed, otherwise the offender may get the impression that although a percentage discount has been specified, no such discount has been in fact been (sic) allowed 
        : R v Mako 
         [2004] NSWCC[A] 90 at [21],  
        R v Lynn  
        [2004] NSWCCA 222 at [13],  
        R v Sutton 
         [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [16] – [17].”  
        
       
      
    19 The failure of the Judge in the present case to quantify the discount does not by itself constitute an error: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [82 and 83]. His Honour made allowance for the plea and I am not persuaded that he did not give appropriate weight to it. 
     
      
    20 The plea, the Judge acknowledged, was entered in the Local Court (on 8 June 2005) and was confirmed in the District Court. The plea, entered at an early stage had significant utilitarian value avoiding the need for a committal hearing and for a trial. The plea properly attracts a discount in the upper range of that considered in R v Thompson and Houlton (supra). 
     
      
    21 Applying to the head sentence of 7 years in this case, a discount for the plea of 25%, the notional starting point of the undiscounted sentence is 9 years and 4 months. 
     
      
    22 The notional starting point of the undiscounted sentence when a discount for the plea of 20% is applied is 8 years and 9 months. 
     
      
    23 The notional starting points of the sentence imposed by his Honour, giving appropriate weight to the plea, would accordingly either have been 9 years and 4 months or 8 years and 9 months.  
     
      
    24 The applicant contends that either of these starting points is excessive, the maximum penalty for the offence being 10 years imprisonment. Similar issues are raised in the second and fourth grounds of appeal to which I will now refer. 
     
      
    25 The second ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in characterising the case as one where the maximum penalty should be considered and erred in his application of s 54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act by failing to apply the relevant considerations as stated in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131. The applicant contends in short that the present case is not a “worst case” and his Honour did no more than refer to the prior record as a basis for having to consider the maximum. 
     
      
    26 The fourth ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in his application of  
     
      
      s 21A  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       by taking into account as an aggravating factor the prior criminal record of the applicant. The applicant contends that whilst his Honour might appropriately in the exercise of his sentencing discretion regard the fact that the applicant was on a s 9 bond at the time of the offence as an aggravating factor, he was not entitled to regard his prior convictions in a similar way. 
       
      
    27 These grounds of appeal are based on remarks on sentence made by the Judge. His Honour, relevantly, said ( ROS at page 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “Aggravating factors here must include his record of similar offending behaviour, together with the fact that he was on a bond at the time of the offence.” 
        
       
      
     And (ROS at page 7) 
     
      
       
        
        “The maximum under the provision is 10 years. And where there has been a history of similar offences, we must be getting beyond the need to refer to s 54B and getting into a position to having (sic) consider the maximum.” 
        
       
      
     And (ROS at page 7) 
     
      
       
        
        “Because of the history of similar offending, I must whilst considering the plea of guilty, still consider a non-parole period well into that as recommended under s 54B for a middle range case.” 
        
       
      
    28 The Judge was understandably concerned about the circumstances of the offence, the applicant’s history of similar offences, his lack of rehabilitation and the need to protect young children. His Honour noted (ROS at page 4) that the “psychological report suggests that the offender has lack of control of his actions, and is unable to accept responsibility for such offences – they just happen” and “Mr Ashkar suggests that the offending behaviour reflects an entrenched paedophilia arousal pattern.”  
     
      
    29 His Honour observed (ROS at page 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “But the prime factor here where rehabilitation and treatment has been attempted, and yet he still submits to an urge even when he has been warned whilst on a bond, the prime factor must be the protection of the community.” 
        
       
      
    30 Section 21A (2) of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (‘CSPA’) relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows: 
        
       
       ………… 
      
     (d) the offender has a record of previous convictions.” 
     
      
    31 Section 21A(4) provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The court is not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so.” 
        
       
      
    32 In R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242, this Court determined how prior criminality should be used against an offender in the light of the common law and the terms of s 21A (‘CSPA’). The Court said in R v M.A.K. R v M.S.K. [2006] NSWCCA 381 [at 51]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 21A(2)(d) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         provides that the fact that an offender has a record of previous convictions is an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence. This Court comprising a bench of five judges recently considered the application of s21A(2)(d) to the determination of a sentence. In  
        R v McNaughton 
         [2006] NSWCCA 242 it was held that a record of previous convictions cannot be taken into account in an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence because to do so would infringe the principle of proportionality. The only relevance of such a record is whether it discloses that more weight is to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist”. 
        
       
      
    33 There was no error by his Honour when he observed that aggravating factors must include the applicant’s record of offending behaviour and his observations of the failure of rehabilitation and treatment and the need to protect the community were consistent with Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465.  
     
      
    34 The remarks of the Judge (ROS at page 7) suggest that his Honour incorrectly made use of the applicant’s prior convictions as an objective circumstance of the offence and to expand the bounds of the sentence beyond that proportionate to the objective circumstances of it. I find support for this view in the notional starting points of the undiscounted sentence.  
     
      
    35 The imposition of the maximum penalty for an offence is reserved for a case which can be properly characterised as falling within the worst category of case for which that penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451 – 452, R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 [at 51], R v Westerman [2004] NSWCCA 161 [13] – [15]. Either of the notional starting points of the undiscounted sentence to which I have referred [supra] is appropriate, in my view, only for a case which can be properly characterised within or very close to the worst category of an offence contrary to s 61M(2). 
     
      
    36 It is implicit from the remarks of the Judge that he assessed the criminality of the offence as being beyond the mid-range. The sole factor, however, identified as giving rise to consideration of the maximum penalty was the history of similar offending. 
     
      
    37 I am satisfied from the remarks on sentence and the notional starting points of the undiscounted sentence that his Honour used the applicant’s prior similar offending as an objective circumstance and to characterise the offence as falling within or very close to the worst category. 
     
      
    38 The use by the Judge of the applicant’s prior similar offending to determine the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence and as an objective circumstance increasing the seriousness of the offence constitutes error: McNaughton at [24]-[25] and [30]. I hasten to add that his Honour did not have the benefit of the judgment in McNaughton at the time he sentenced the applicant.  
     
      
    39 The applicant’s offending conduct was very serious. The complainant, a mere child of four, was grabbed around the vagina/buttock area. She was playing at the time on the floor of the Salvation Army shop in an environment that her mother was entitled to expect that she would be safe.  
     
      
    40 Although the Judge remarked that the offence may not appear to be part of a planned criminal activity he found that the surveillance suggested that the applicant was in the vicinity of the complainant “for some amount of time, and apparently went so far as to find a doll, to provide the excuse to actually go up to the girl and commit the offence”. 
     
      
    41 The touching involved, however, was on the outside of the complainant’s underclothing, the applicant was not a relative nor was he in a position of trust. 
     
      
    42 Although a very serious offence, it cannot, in my view, be regarded as being within or very close to the worst category of offence contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 
     
      
    43 The complaint made in the second ground of appeal to this extent has been established.  
     
      
    44 It is appropriate to note what was said in R v Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297 [at 54]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would be both undesirable and inappropriate to seek to define the requirements of the category of the worst class of case. Plainly, it is not necessary for a case to so qualify that the conclusion be reached that it would be impossible to conceive of a worst case. However, more is required than that the case be regarded as a very serious one.” 
        
       
      
    45 The notional starting points of the undiscounted sentence, as I have said, are appropriate only for something within or very close to the worst class of case and I am satisfied are excessive. The first ground of appeal, to this extent, has been established.  
     
      
    46 The third ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in his application of  
     
      
      s44  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       by expressly declining to find special circumstances and fixing a period of parole in a strictly sequential way. 
       
      
    47 The applicant correctly argues (which the Crown concedes) that the Judge, having declined to find special circumstances did not comply with s44(2) Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act in fixing the balance of the term of the sentence. 
     
      
    48 S 44(2) provides: 
     
      
       
      “The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).” 
       
      
    49 His Honour imposed a sentence of 7 years and set a non-parole period of 5 years, the balance of the term (2 years) exceeded one third of the non-parole period. The non-parole period having been set at 5 years confined the total sentence to not more than 6 years 8 months. 
     
      
    50 There was no error in his Honour declining to find special circumstances. The third ground of appeal to the extent indicated has been established. 
     
      
    51 It is unnecessary to consider the fourth ground of appeal.  
     
      
    52 In my view, the errors demonstrated, render it appropriate for this Court to re-sentence. 
     
      
    53 A standard non-parole period, as mentioned, has been prescribed in respect of the offence of five years imprisonment. The standard represents “an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness” (s 54A(2)). 
     
      
    54 Guidance to the approach to be taken to the imposition of a custodial sentence in respect of an offence where there is a standard non-parole is provided by Kirby J in MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271 at [33] who identified four principal issues to be addressed: 
     
      
       
      (i) What term of imprisonment is appropriate having regard to the offence and the circumstances of the offender? 
       
       
      (ii) Should the offence be characterised as being in the mid-range of objective seriousness ? 
       
       
      (iii) Are there other reasons in the matters identified in s 21A (relating to the offender) for departing from the standard non-parole period ? 
       
      
     (iv) Are there special circumstances ? 
     
      
    55 These issues are not required to be addressed in any particular order: MLP [at 34], R v Moffit (1990) 20 NSWLR 114.  
     
      
    56 A plea of guilty might in itself be a reason for departure from the standard non-parole period. Where a Court determines that there are reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, the standard non-parole period nevertheless remains of relevance in the sentencing determination, as a reference point, bench mark, sounding board or guide post: R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575, R v MLP [at 32]. 
     
      
       
       
      
    57 The offence in the present case is characterised as being beyond the mid- range of objective seriousness. It is, as previously stated, a very serious offence. 
     
      
       
       
      
    58 The subjective circumstances of the applicant have been outlined (supra). He is of Aboriginal descent, with limited education, who has experienced a difficult background. At the time of offending, he was aged 55 years. 
     
      
       
       
      
    59 More weight is to be given in the case of the applicant to considerations of retribution, personal deterrence and protection of the community due to his history of similar offending. 
     
      
       
       
      
    60 The standard non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment is to be used as a reference point. The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
       
       
      
    61 In my view, the appropriate term of imprisonment having regard to the very serious nature of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the applicant is 8 years imprisonment. From that, I would allow a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty. This would reduce the sentence to 6 years. 
     
      
       
      
    62 I do not find special circumstances. I set the non-parole period at 4 years and 6 months. The only reason for departing from the standard non-parole period is the discount for the early plea of guilty.  
     
      
    63 I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
    (i) Leave to appeal granted; 
     
      
     (ii) Appeal allowed, sentence imposed in the District Court quashed; 
     
      
       
      (iii) In lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 23 March 2005 and expiring on 22 September 2009 and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months expiring on 22 March 2011.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit of reading the draft judgment of Simpson J. I agree with the orders which her Honour proposes and generally with her reasons. 
     
      
    2 In my view the sentencing judge erred in regarding the stabbing as an act of gratuitous cruelty. The fact that the police dog was killed was a relevant circumstance of the offence, although the part it should play in the sentencing process is less apparent. The evidence was that the dog was trained to restrain but not physically injure a person the police were seeking to apprehend. Whether such a person would be aware of this I rather doubt. If, when armed with a knife, a person is pursued by a police dog there is a real likelihood that the knife may be used in a manner which causes serious injury to the animal. The pursued person may react in a deliberate manner, as her Honour found, but that action may be motivated, at least in part, by a fear of injury from the dog rather than directed solely to making good an escape. 
     
      
    3 Notwithstanding this matter the other serious elements of the offences which have been identified by Simpson J justify the orders her Honour proposes. 
     
      
    4 I also wish to add to her Honour’s remarks about the form of the sentencing hearing. Remarks on sentence are provided to inform the offender of the sentence to be imposed, and the matters which the sentencing judge considered when arriving at that sentence. The sentencing judge must speak in clear language confined to a statement of matters which justify the particular sentence. The remarks should generally be formulated so that they may be understood by the offender and others present at the court hearing. The transcribed remarks should be able to be appreciated by the ordinary lay reader. 
     
      
    5 Although references to statute may be necessary in order to adequately explain the remarks, references to authority should be confined to a minimum. Lengthy and complex discussions of sentencing principle are generally a matter for the appellate courts which, even then, should strive for clarity and appropriate brevity. 
     
      
    6 SIMPSON J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon the applicant in the District Court on 6 April 2006 following his pleas of guilty to each of five counts on an indictment. 
     
      
    7 The counts, in the sequence in which they appeared on the indictment, were: 
     
      
       
      (i) use offensive weapon (two knives) with intent to prevent lawful apprehension; 
       
      (ii) assault (Stephen Ward); 
       
      (iii) intimidate (Stephen Ward) with intent to cause him to fear physical or mental harm; 
       
      (iv) intimidate (Wayne Davies) with intent to cause him to fear physical or mental harm; 
       
      (v) resist police officer in the execution of his duty. 
       
      
    8 Count 1 was brought under s33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. 
     
      
     Count 2 was brought under s61 of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for two years. Counts 3 and 4 were brought under s562AB of the Crimes Act; each carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years. Count 5 was brought under s58 of the Crimes Act. It also carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years.9 Gibb DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: 
       
      (use weapon to avoid arrest): a total term of nine years, four months, made up of a non-parole period of seven years, with a balance of term of two years and four months; 
       
       
      Count 2: 
       
      (assault): a total term of eight months and seven days, made up of a non-parole period of six months and seven days, with a balance of term of two months; 
       
       
      Count 3: 
       
      (intimidate): a total term of one year, five months and 30 days, made up of a non-parole period of 15 months and 15 days, with a balance of term of four years and 15 days; 
       
       
      Count 4: 
       
      (intimidate): a total term of one year, ten months and 15 days, made up of a non-parole period of 17 months, with a balance of term of five months and 15 days; 
       
       
      Count 5: 
       
      (resist arrest): a total term of one year and 15 days, made up of a non-parole period of nine months and a balance of term of three months and 15 days. 
       
      
    10 The sentence imposed in respect of Count 1 reflected a discount of 18.5% referable to the plea of guilty, in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. Each of the remaining sentences was discounted by 25% on the same basis. 
     
      
    11 Her Honour staggered the commencement dates of the sentences. She specified that the sentence imposed in respect of Count 2 (assault) be the first to commence, on 13 February 2005; that the sentences imposed in respect of Counts 3 and 4 (intimidation) follow, the Count 3 sentence to be wholly cumulative upon the non-parole period of the Count 2 sentence, and commence on 5 October 2006; that the Count 4 (resist arrest) sentence be partially concurrent with and partially accumulated upon the non-parole period of the Count 3 sentence; that the Count 5 sentence likewise be partially concurrent with and partially accumulated upon the non-parole period imposed in respect of Count 4, and commence on 20 June 2007; and the Count 1 (use of offensive weapon to avoid apprehension) sentence also commence on 20 June 2007, and therefore subsume the resist arrest sentence. 
     
      
    12 As a result the total effective term of imprisonment imposed was of 11 years, eight months and six days, consisting of a non-parole period of 9 years, 4 months and 6 days, commencing on 13 February 2005 and expiring on 19 June 2014, with a balance of term of 2 years and 4 months, commencing on 20 June 2014 and expiring on 19 October 2016. 
     
      
    13 The rather unusual selection of figures appears to have been the result of a strictly mathematical application of the sentencing discounts, followed by a similarly strict application of the formula contained in s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the “Sentencing Procedure Act”). 
     
      
       
      facts 
       
      
    14 All charges arose as a result of a single episode of criminality that took place between 22 and 23 December 2004, continuing over several hours. 
     
      
    15 The applicant lived at an address in Seven Hills, premises he shared with Wayne Davies, the victim of Count 3. Mr Davies suffers from an intellectual impairment. The applicant was friendly with a young woman, Angela Ward (the daughter of Stephen Ward, the victim of Counts 2 and 3). It may be that the two did not share a common perception of the nature or extent of their relationship. Ms Ward and her father lived nearby. At about 7.30 pm on 22 December 2004 Ms Ward went to the applicant’s home to visit. The applicant was not present, but Mr Davies was. Ms Ward stayed and talked to Mr Davies. While she was there the applicant telephoned her. He was clearly intoxicated. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Do you want to see the kind of person I really am. Two blokes at the pub approached me. I want to chop them up with an axe. I want you to see it so you know what type of person I am.” 
        
       
      
    16 He arrived at home shortly thereafter. At the same time a friend of his, Kevin Searle, also arrived at his home. The two had both come from the same hotel, but did not arrive together. The applicant spoke to Ms Ward about being a white supremacist. She left the premises. 
     
      
    17 The applicant then went to Ms Ward’s home. He arrived before she did. Her father was at home. The applicant began shouting. Mr Ward saw that he was shouting into a mobile telephone. Mr Ward told him to take it elsewhere. The applicant pushed Mr Ward, the applicant’s palms in Mr Ward’s shoulder. Mr Ward stumbled and almost fell, but regained his balance. The applicant again spoke of being a white supremacist. He was behaving aggressively, repeatedly pushing Mr Ward, threatening to hit him, and shouting at him. He then turned and walked away. He returned shortly after, again shouting abusively. He threatened to obtain a gun and shoot Mr Ward. He left again, and again returned after a short time. This time he was carrying an axe. While holding the axe, he verbally abused Mr Ward. Mr Ward feared for his life. The applicant saw Mr Ward’s dog and turned and ran back towards his own house. At this stage police, who had been called, began arriving on the scene, sirens sounding. Mr Ward was frightened, angry and worried for his daughter. His body was trembling. Mr Ward is in receipt of a disability pension and has severe joint and back problems. 
     
      
    18 The applicant ran home; Mr Davies and Mr Searle were still in the house. The applicant locked the doors and windows. He was still in possession of the axe. Both men feared for their safety. Police arrived at the house. The applicant threatened that if they entered he would kill them. He armed himself with two carving knives. Mr Davies and Mr Searle remained in the house while the applicant moved around in an agitated state. Eventually he allowed them to leave the house. When they did, they were ordered by police to put their hands on their heads and then lie on the ground. They were searched and questioned and then allowed to leave. Mr Davies spent the night at Mr Searle’s home. 
     
      
    19 The applicant shouted abuse, threats and profanities at police. State Protection Group police, including negotiators, arrived and secured the premises, containing the applicant inside the house. At 4.20 am the applicant was persuaded to leave the house. He walked out of the front door, holding in each hand a 20 cm bladed carving knife, the blades pointing upwards. He refused police demands to drop the knives and did not comply with other instructions. He continued to abuse police, and to threaten to stab any police officer who approached him. 
     
      
    20 A “tazer” shot was fired by the police in his direction. (A tazer is a weapon which, by the use of electrical impulses, causes the muscles to seize, and the body to become rigid, thus immobilising the person against whom it is used.) The tazer shot was ineffective. A number of rounds from a “bean bag” shotgun (apparently a less lethal weapon than the tazer) were then fired, also with little or no effect. The applicant ran off, still holding the knives. A police dog, Titan, was released to apprehend him. Titan pursued the applicant and caught him outside Mr Ward’s premises. The dog lunged at the applicant’s left wrist, thus preventing him from using the knife held in that hand. He took the applicant’s wrist in his mouth but did not bite. The applicant used the knife he held in his right hand to stab the dog. The stab wound proved fatal. Police caught up. A violent struggle ensued, with the applicant resisting police efforts to disarm and arrest him. Another tazer shot was fired, causing the applicant to fall to the ground. The applicant was eventually arrested, cuffs were placed on his feet and ankles, and he was stripped naked. He was taken for psychiatric assessment and was found to be suffering from no mental illness. He was medically examined and found to have extensive grazes, abrasions, bruises and swelling to his head and face. 
     
      
    21 On the findings made by the sentencing judge, which are not the subject of challenge: 
     
      
       
       the first offence in time was the assault on Mr Ward. This was constituted initially by verbal abuse, sufficient to put him in fear for his safety; and was followed by the pushing and threats to kill him (this was Count 2 on the indictment); 
       the second offence in time was the intimidation of Mr Ward. It was constituted by the applicant’s approaching Mr Ward, with the axe, and at the same time verbally abusing him, putting Mr Ward in fear for his life (this was Count 3 on the indictment); 
       the third offence was the offence of intimidating Mr Davies. It was committed when the applicant ran home after hearing police sirens, and entered the house, armed with the axe. Mr Davies feared that if he attempted to leave the house the applicant would hurt him (this was Count 4 on the indictment); 
       the fourth offence, which was that of resist arrest, was committed when the applicant ran away before being seized by the police dog. (This was Count 5 on the indictment.); 
       the final offence in time was that which appears first on the indictment, and is the most serious of all, the offence of using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension. This offence was constituted by the use of the knives to threaten police and then to subdue the police dog, resulting in its death, at a time when the applicant was running from the house and being pursued by police. 
       
       
      subjective circumstances 
       
      
    22 The applicant was born on 9 December 1981. He was just 22 years of age at the dates of the offences. He had previously been convicted of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence (also brought under s33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act); and, at the same time, of malicious wounding. For the first of these offences he was, on 18 October 2002, sentenced to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of 15 months, commencing on 12 February 2002; the second to a concurrent term of imprisonment for 12 months. In December 2003 he was convicted of assaulting a police officer in the execution of duty, and was subjected to a bond under s9 of the Act. He was released on parole in May 2003, with a parole period of one year and nine months, expiring on 11 February 2004. He was, accordingly, on conditional liberty and subject to the strictures of the parole order at the time of the events giving rise to the present offences. Parole was revoked on 31 January 2005, and he served the balance of that term. 
     
      
    23 A psychological report was in evidence. This showed that the applicant had had a disturbed childhood, some features of which he was not prepared to disclose or discuss, but which had caused depression and aggressive behaviour since his early primary school years. 
     
      
    24 His father was violent, both to the applicant and to his mother, and his parents’ marriage broke down when the applicant was eight. The applicant nevertheless retains a close and apparently affectionate relationship with his father. 
     
      
    25 The applicant was disruptive at school and was expelled and sent to Boys’ Town. He was said to have been diagnosed as suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder for which dexamphetamine was prescribed. His behaviour improved, but deteriorated again on his leaving Boys’ Town and returning to the public school system. He was again expelled. He left school at the age of 14 years and nine months. Thereafter he had some employment – as a plumber’s assistant, as a welder, and assisting his father in the installation of automatic teller machines; he had begun a boilermakers’ apprenticeship course at TAFE, which he has been able to continue after being taken into custody, on these charges. 
     
      
    26 He has used a variety of drugs, including cannabis, amphetamines, and heroin, and has abused alcohol. At some stage he undertook a rehabilitation course, but the success or otherwise of this is not apparent. 
     
      
    27 He has had two significant relationships. The first was with a woman called Belinda. It was her father who was the victim of the earlier offences to which I have already made reference. In that respect, those offences bear some disturbing parallels with the present. I have already commented upon the possibly different perceptions of the nature of the second relationship, with Ms Angela Ward. 
     
      
    28 Personality testing revealed schizoid and depressive features as well as aggressive and passive/aggressive traits, and “significant results” on the paranoid scale. The applicant is said to be suspicious and mistrustful of others, insular, isolated, depressive, insecure, anxious, hedonistic, impulsive and experiencing difficulties in conforming to mainstream standards of behaviour. 
     
      
       
      the proceedings on sentence 
       
      
    29 Despite the applicant’s pleas of guilty, a contested factual issue was said to have emerged, necessitating evidence being given by three police officers and the applicant himself. Although it is not easy, from the examination and cross examination of these witnesses, to discern the precise nature of what was said to be the factual contest, it appears to have related to the conduct of the applicant in stabbing the police dog, the extent of his resistance to police after doing so, and the extent and reasonableness of the force used by police in effecting his arrest. In particular, the applicant denied that he had struggled with police after the stabbing of the dog. There were other issues of minor detail which are quite unimportant, irrelevant to sentencing, and do not warrant the expenditure of further time or attention. 
     
      
       
      the remarks on sentence  
       
      
    30 The remarks on sentence are lengthy, extending over 49 pages of very small type. This is the cause of one matter of concern that ought here be mentioned. The transcript of the proceedings on the day the sentences were imposed shows that, rather than reading or making her remarks orally, the judge handed to counsel for the parties a prepared document setting out her findings of fact, her approach to the sentencing exercise, and her reasons for selecting the sentences she did. A similar course was undertaken at first instance, and received the express disapprobation of this Court, in R v Bottin [2005] NSWCCA 254. Studdert J, with whom Kirby and Howie JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that the procedure adopted in this case is a procedure which ought to be discouraged. Ordinarily, sentencing remarks are published in oral form so that all in court can be made fully acquainted not only with the sentence or sentences being passed but with the reasons for such sentence or sentences as well. Obviously, this is of particular concern to the offender, any victim or victims, and any relatives of the victim or victims who may be present in court. Publication of reasons by oral means also affords the opportunity for correction if there is some obvious error revealed in the expression of the sentencing remarks.” 
        
       
      
     I would respectfully endorse what his Honour said. There is an immediacy of remarks on sentence orally delivered at the time of the imposition of sentences which is valuable in the administration of criminal justice. Delivering remarks orally brings home to all concerned the full explanation for the sentence or sentences selected, together with a recital of the facts of the offences themselves. Sentencing remarks will convey all of the objective circumstances of the offence or offences, any aggravating features, and any circumstances by which the offences are mitigated, or the sentence or sentences ameliorated. 
     
      
    31 I appreciate that, in this case, the sheer length of the remarks was itself a deterrent to oral delivery, and her Honour, in stating her intention, observed that she did not think her voice would sustain the exercise. This, however, is a reason for economy in the preparation of the remarks, which, in this case, could have been achieved without adversely impacting upon thoroughness. 
     
      
    32 The sentencing judge resolved the area of factual dispute against the applicant: she held that, contrary to his evidence, he had continued to struggle with police in order to resist arrest. No challenge is now made to that factual finding. She expressly held that the applicant’s action in knifing the police dog was: 
     
      
       
        
        “not an instinctive muscular response but a deliberate act”. 
        
       
      
     This finding appears in that part of the Remarks devoted to aggravating features. Otherwise, the judge’s recitation of the relevant facts was essentially in accordance with what had been put before her, by agreement, by the prosecution, as summarised at the outset of these reasons. 
     
      
    33 Her Honour turned her mind sequentially to the aggravating features of the offences, provided for by s21A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. Generally, with one significant exception to which I will come, these are uncontroversial. Her Honour found, for example, that the offence of intimidation of Mr Davies was aggravated by his vulnerability (see s21A(2)(l)), because of his intellectual impairment. She held that the offences of intimidation were aggravated by the threatened use of the axe, but also held that, because that circumstance:  
     
      
       
        
        “verges upon being an element [of the offences] in that it is the vehicle that is involved as founding the basis of the intimidation”,  
        
       
      
    it would be accorded only nominal weight. 
     
      
       
      Her Honour said: 
       
        
         
        “I find that the deliberate stabbing and killing of police dog Titan, by plunging virtually the entire length of the blade of a substantial knife into his chest was an act of gratuitous cruelty productive of substantial injury, emotional harm, loss and damage and sounding in the death of the police dog Titan, and the emotional harm and distress caused to the police officers witnessing that event, and, in particular, his handler, Senior Constable McDowel, who also witnessed that act.” 
        
       
      
     Her Honour went on to say that she did not place separate weight, for the purposes of aggravation, upon substantial injury, emotional harm (distress), loss and damaged caused. Her Honour made reference to the decision of this Court in R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184; 147 A Crim R 520, expressly finding that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The reality, however is that this situation, albeit the killing of a police dog rather than a child, is more akin to that in  
        R v Hoerler 
        .” 
        
       
      
     She went on to extract certain paragraphs from that decision. These included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “[42] Plainly a violent attack, albeit not one accompanied by an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, by a person in a position of trust and responsibility upon a defenceless young child, is a circumstance of considerable aggravation. In this sense only can the offence of manslaughter in such cases be regarded as some form of separate category. It is a circumstance of such significance that it is entitled to substantial weight in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The sense of outrage in the community about such a case is so strong that the element of retribution must play a prominent part in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. However, there is such a wide variety of other factors which may accompany this circumstance, that sentences for offences which share only this characteristic would not be expected to result in an identifiable sentencing range or pattern. 
        
       
       
        
        [43] In the case of manslaughter, as I noted above, the acts constituting the offence and the circumstances of the offender at the time of the offence, may vary over a very wide range of objective gravity. The actual physical assault leading to death can range from comparatively minor force to a sustained beating over a prolonged period of time, incorporating elements of gratuitous cruelty. The personal culpability of the offender may vary from a carer who acts out of despair or in circumstances bordering on accident, to the vicious acts of a sadist. 
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [66] The fact that the fatal blow occurred in the course of a prolonged violent attack elevates the level of culpability of the offender to a high order. That fatal blow was accompanied by at least two other blows, and probably more, any one of which could have been fatal. ...” 
        
       
      
    34 S21A(2)(f) specifies that the use of gratuitous cruelty in an offence is an aggravating feature. Her Honour held that the offence against s33B(1)(a) was aggravated by the use of gratuitous cruelty, specifically, in the stabbing of the police dog. This finding is challenged, and is the subject of one of the specific grounds of the application for leave to appeal. I will return to this question when I come to deal with the individual grounds of the application. Her Honour then held that this offence was objectively very serious, falling into the worst category of such offences. This finding is also the subject of challenge. 
     
      
    35 Her Honour considered subjective factors and matters of mitigation. She accepted that, pursuant to s21A(3) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, sub-paras (b) and (k) were available as mitigating features. These provide, respectively, as matters of mitigation to be taken into account, that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, and that the offender pleaded guilty. She rejected a submission put on behalf of the applicant that his prospects of rehabilitation were good, and another that he had shown remorse for the offences. She considered, correctly, that both general and specific deterrence were relevant considerations. 
     
      
    36 Her Honour noted the pleas of guilty, and, as I have indicated above, in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton, allowed a sentencing discount of 25% in respect of Counts 2 to 5. In respect of Count 1, she allowed a discount of 18.5%, the factual contest that necessitated evidence being given by three police officers, thus diminishing the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty in relation to that offence. [It appears to me that there is some confusion here: I have earlier alluded to the difficulty of discerning precisely what the factual dispute was. So far as the transcript assists, it suggests that that went to the charge of resisting arrest. However, no issue is raised on the application in relation to the discounts allowed for the pleas of guilty, and it is unnecessary to take further time on this matter.] 
     
      
    37 Her Honour rejected a further submission that the applicant had been subjected to extra-curial punishment by the manner of his arrest. She did, however, determine to reduce, although by only a very small amount, the sentences by reason of the applicant’s having fallen to the ground. 
     
      
    38 She declined to find special circumstances within the meaning of s44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, justifying departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence, either in respect to any of the individual sentences, or the overall term. No challenge is made to that determination. 
     
      
    39 Her Honour made specific findings as to where each offence lay on a scale of objective gravity of offences of its kind. The two offences against Mr Ward she held to fall into the lower/middle of the range (rejecting an argument put on behalf of the applicant that it was in the low end of the range). The offence of intimidation against Mr Davies she held was aggravated by his vulnerability (his intellectual impairment) and therefore fell into the mid range. The offence of resisting arrest she placed in the lower end of the range (contrasting with the low range contended for on behalf of the applicant). And the final offence, involving the use of knives and the killing of the dog, she placed in the worst category of offences of its kind. 
     
      
    40 Her Honour considered the questions of totality, concurrence and accumulation, and proceeded to impose the sentences I have already set out. She specified the sentences she would have imposed but for the pleas of guilty. There were: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: 11 ½ years 
       
      Count 2: 11 months 
       
      Count 3: 2 years 
       
      Count 4: 2 ½ years 
       
      Count 5: 1 ½ years. 
       
       
      the grounds of the application 
       
      
    41 The grounds pleaded are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentences imposed in respect of Counts 3 and 4 of the indictment are manifestly excessive. 
         
        2. The sentencing judge erred in taking into account as aggravating factors in respect to Count 1 on the indictment that: 
         
          
          (a) the offence involved gratuitous cruelty; 
           
          (b) that the applicant’s action was not an instinctive muscular response but a deliberate act. 
          
         
        3. The sentencing judge erred in characterising Count 1 on the indictment as being in the worst category of offences. 
         
        4. The sentence imposed in respect of Count 1 on the indictment is manifestly excessive. 
         
        5. The total effective sentence is manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1: The sentences imposed in respect of Counts 3 and 4 of the indictment are manifestly excessive 
       
      
    42 The argument advanced on behalf of the applicant was as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) her Honour classified the intimidation offence against Mr Ward as in the lower/middle range of objective seriousness, and that against Mr Davies as in the mid-range;  
       
       
      (ii) in reaching these conclusions, her Honour had regard only to the objective facts, and not (as she ought to have done) to the circumstances of the case, both objective and subjective; 
       
       
      (iii) since her Honour allowed, in each case, a discount in respect of the pleas of guilty of 25%, the starting points, before application of the discounts were, as her Honour stated, respectively, two years and two and a half years (against a statutory maximum of five years); 
       
       
      (iv) these starting points are consistent with the assessment of objective gravity; 
       
      
      
      (v) the process involved three steps –  
       
        
        assessment of where in the range of objective seriousness of offences of that kind each offence lay; 
        determination of the appropriate starting point, in the light of that assessment and the statutory maximum; 
        application of the discount of 25%; 
          
           
          
        
       
      (vi) error is identified in the assessment of the objective gravity, in that her Honour had regard to the objective features of the offences, but disregarded ameliorating subjective features. Accordingly, the assessment of objective gravity in each case is flawed and the process produced a result that is not warranted. 
       
      
    43 An alternative way of putting the argument is that the sentences imposed corresponded precisely with the evaluation of objective gravity, without any allowance for mitigating features. Complaint made was that, having made the assessment of objective gravity, her Honour did not take into account, in consideration of the appropriate sentences, mitigating factors. If her assessment of objective gravity was correct, and the sentencing starting points therefore correct on that basis, some adjustment was called for in recognition of the mitigating features. This would have resulted in imposition of lower sentences. 
     
      
    44 Two questions arise: 
     
      
      is it correct that her Honour assessed the objective gravity of each offence by reference only to the objective features, without regard to other relevant, mitigating features?; 
      if so, was that incorrect? 
        
         
        
      
    45 The contention that the assessment of objective gravity was made on the basis of objective features, without regard to subjective features, gains some support from where it is to be found in the sequence of the sentencing remarks. Each assessment appears after a recital of the facts and consideration of the aggravating features, but before reference to subjective features or mitigating factors such as the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation (which her Honour found, effectively, were not good) and, more importantly, the contents of the psychological report setting out the applicant’s background and history. 
     
      
    46 I would therefore infer that her Honour did approach the matter in the manner suggested on behalf of the applicant. Was that erroneous? 
     
      
    47 Sentencing judges have long been acquainted and familiar with the notion of making an assessment of the objective gravity of offences for which they are passing sentence, although, until recently, this has more commonly been done intuitively: see Regina v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, at [79]. 
     
      
    48 The notion of formally and expressly placing any given offence in a range of objective seriousness of offences of its kind has come about as a result of the introduction into the Sentencing Procedure Act of Part 4, Division 1A, enacted in 2002, with effect from 1 February 2003. That legislation was comprehensively explained by this Court in Way. The Court construed the concept of objective seriousness, as contained in the legislation. Although Part 4 Division 1A does not apply to any of the present offences, there is no reason why the approach there outlined to the assessment of objective gravity, and which is relevant to objective gravity as distinct from subjective features, should not – and every reason why it should – extend to the concept of objective seriousness of offences not directly the subject of the Division. 
     
      
    49 At [86] the Court considered the circumstances which affect the seriousness of an offence. Some of these, the Court said, will be “personal to the offender at the time of the offence” but relevant because of their causal connection with the commission of the offence. Such matters include motivation, mental state, mental illness or intellectual disability where causally related to the commission of the offence. The distinction was expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Such matters [matters relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness] can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment.” 
        
       
      
     The Court classified other matters, such as those which explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge upon moral culpability (e.g. youth or prior sexual abuse), as more accurately described as circumstances of the offender and not of the offence. 
     
      
    50 Her Honour recognised that two of the mitigating factors specified by s21A(3) of the Sentencing Procedure Act were applicable. They were: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity,  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (k) a plea of guilty …” 
        
       
      
     Plainly, the plea of guilty cannot in any way affect the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences. 
     
      
    51 The sentencing judge recorded that the case presented on behalf of the applicant in mitigation rested effectively upon three facts, which her Honour identified as: 
     
      
       
        
        “His self-induced intoxication; the manifestation of uncontrolled anger; and the sheer irrationality of his actions in the period.” 
        
       
      
    52 The argument demonstrates the high level of refinement that has been introduced into the sentencing process, not least by the introduction of Part 4, Division 1A. As I have observed, that Division is not directly relevant to the present sentencing exercise; however, it is clear from the approach taken to this sentencing exercise that the procedures required by that Division have crept into sentencing in other cases. 
     
      
    53 I have come to the view that counsel for the applicant is correct in submitting that the assessment of objective gravity was made without regard to subjective circumstances, such as matters of motivation or mental state. That, however, was not, in the circumstances of this case, erroneous. There was nothing in the subjective case that affected the assessment of objective gravity. But counsel is correct in further submitting that, after that assessment was made, the sentences were not tempered by reference to the personal circumstances of the applicant relevant to the appropriate level of punishment, such as his unfortunate childhood and adolescence, affecting, although to a moderate extent only, his moral culpability. It is one thing to assess objective gravity without regard to subjective circumstances; it is another (and may denote error) then to fix a sentence by reference to objective gravity, excluding any mitigating features. 
     
      
    54 The difficulty, however, for the applicant is that her Honour’s findings of fact in respect of these matters do not suggest that, had the correct approach been taken, a different result would have ensued. Her Honour was sceptical about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation; more than once she noted that he had done nothing to address his problems and had little insight into his behaviour. She was also sceptical about his expressed remorse. There was little in the way of positive findings that would give the applicant comfort. The s21A(3) features that were held to be applicable, that I have already outlined, were meagre, limited to the pleas of guilty (for which the applicant received full credit) and the absence of planning or organisation in the offences. 
     
      
    55 I have given a good deal of consideration to the question of whether his background circumstances, as disclosed in the psychological report, were such as to reduce, in any significant way, his moral culpability, such as to have required the imposition of lesser sentences. I have come to the conclusion that they do not. 
     
      
    56 Accordingly, error in the result has not been demonstrated. I would reject ground 1 of the application. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in taking into account certain factors as aggravating factors in respect to Count 1 on the indictment 
       
      
    57 The “certain factors” were identified as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) the offence involved gratuitous cruelty; and 
         
         (b) that the applicant’s action was not an instinctive muscular response but a deliberate act.” 
         
        
       
      
    58 In putting her findings as she did (see paragraph 33), her Honour ran together two separate aggravating factors for which provision is made by s21A(2). These are: 
     
      
       
        
        “(f) the offence involved gratuitous cruelty, 
         
        (g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”. 
        
       
      
    59 In my opinion the passages quoted from Hoerler demonstrate, of themselves, error. In linking, by analogy, the applicant’s offence with the offence under consideration in Hoerler her Honour has in my view substantially overstated the gravity of this offence. Hoerler involved the brutal manslaughter of a young baby, with ancillary behaviour described as “grotesque”, committed by a person with the care of and responsibility for his welfare. There are many aspects of the passages extracted that demonstrate significant disparity between the two cases. There are references to physical assault, to a fatal blow, and to a prolonged violent attack. The applicant was not in a position of trust or responsibility and his act of “cruelty” lacked the sustained, continuing and sadistic qualities that were present in Hoerler. 
     
      
    60 Recourse to the report of Hoerler itself strengthens that conclusion. In the remainder of [66], which was not extracted, the following was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Furthermore, the conduct of the offender included the aggravating conduct of dragging the body of the baby over a surface, such as a carpet or a sofa, face down causing a number of facial injuries. Over and above that is the gratuitous cruelty of an almost grotesque character by the application of clamps to both feet of the deceased baby Jordan with sufficient force to break his toes. That conduct was not fatal and he is not to be sentenced for it as if it were an element constituting the offence. It does, however, make this a crime in which the conduct of the Respondent was of a high level of objective gravity as an incident of the overall conduct leading to the fatal blow.” 
        
       
      
    61 The reference to Hoerler appears in the sentencing remarks under the heading: 
     
      
       
        
        “An offence aggravated by gratuitous cruelty” 
        
       
      
     I am quite unable to accept the analogy between the two cases. I have no wish to minimise the seriousness of the applicant’s conduct. Here, however, while in the grip of a police dog, the applicant stabbed the dog (admittedly forcefully) once. That cannot be compared with the level of violence and cruelty described in the judgment in Hoerler.62 The Crown conceded that the stabbing of the police dog could not qualify as gratuitous cruelty within s21A(2)(l). It was, in my opinion, an error so to categorise that act. 
     
      
    63 However, the Crown also argued that the act was a gross and callous act that no doubt seriously affected the police officer to whom the dog was attached and therefore constituted an aggravating feature under s21A(2)(g). Her Honour accepted that that was so, but declined to give it significant weight. Again, it was submitted by the Crown, there was no error in the result. 
     
      
    64 The difficulty with the Crown’s position is that a fair reading of her Honour’s remarks demonstrates, in my opinion, that it was her characterisation of the knifing of the dog as an act of gratuitous cruelty that led her then to classify the offence as being in the worst category of such offences. 
     
      
    65 I have come to the view that, while it was an error to regard the stabbing as an act of gratuitous cruelty, thus aggravating the offence, nevertheless, the fact that a police dog was stabbed and killed does take the offence into the higher levels of objective seriousness of offences of using weapons to resist lawful apprehension. I am, however, satisfied that it could not be at the very top: the use of firearms would have to occupy that position. 
     
      
    66 On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that the stabbing of the police dog was an act integral to the offence charged in Count 1 and could not, therefore, be an aggravating feature. 
     
      
    67 I would reject this. It was sufficient to constitute the offence that the applicant brandished the two knives; the actual use of them, to kill a police dog, was a circumstance grafted upon that basic fact, taking this offence into the upper echelons of offences of its kind, even if not quite at the outer limits. I agree with the sentencing judge that killing the dog (whilst not properly seen as an act of gratuitous cruelty for the purposes of s21A(2)(1)), did constitute a circumstance of aggravation. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 3 and 4: Count 1 is not in the worst category of such offences and the sentence for that Count is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    68 For reasons I have already given I accept that the principal reason which led her Honour to categorise the offence as in the worst class was not available as an aggravating feature; it was, however, a part of the context of the offence relevant to the overall assessment of objective gravity. I am also satisfied that the categorisation of itself was erroneous, although the offence lay outside of the worst category by only a small margin. As I have indicated, it might ordinarily be thought that the use of guns as distinct from knives would constitute a worse offence; but this offence is complete when weapons are flourished or brandished or presented; it is not necessary that they be brought into impact with a person (or animal or object). Indeed, if the weapon used in the offence were used to inflict injury on a person, the offence charged would be one of greater seriousness than an offence against s33B(1)(a). I have come to the view that the manner in which the knife was used was sufficient to justify the classification of the offence as in almost the worst category. Ground 3 is therefore made out, but the effect of the error is relatively minor. 
     
      
    69 And it does not follow from a “worst case” finding in terms of objective gravity that a sentence of the maximum available, or close to it, was appropriate. In the determination of sentence it was also necessary to factor in any mitigating circumstances which did not go to the objective gravity of the offence. 
     
      
    70 In respect of this offence the discount for the plea of guilty was fixed at 18.5%. This means that the starting point, prior to the discount, was almost 11 ½ years (against a statutory maximum of 12 years). Such a sentence can be justified if the applicant’s offence was properly characterised as in the worst category of offences of its kind, and there are no mitigating circumstances. 
     
      
    71 Counsel for the applicant produced statistics from the Judicial Commission. These show that this sentence is the highest, by a significant margin, ever recorded in respect of an offence against s33B(1)(a). The previous highest recorded maximum term is of imprisonment for six years; the previous highest recorded non-parole period is four years. That puts the applicant’s head sentence at more than 50% above the previous highest head sentence; and the non-parole period at 75% higher than the previous highest recorded non-parole period. 
     
      
    72 This of itself means little. It would be necessary, in order to draw anything from it, to know more of the circumstances of the other offences and offenders. 
     
      
    73 It is well established that the maximum sentence is reserved for offences in the worst category. But here the starting point was not the maximum: it was slightly less. I have come to the conclusion that the sentence was not manifestly excessive in the sense that it was not open to her Honour. There was little in the applicant’s subjective case available to mitigate either the offence, or the sentence to be imposed. Although at the very highest end of the range available for the offence, it was within her Honour’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    74 I would reject Grounds 3 and 4. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: the effective overall sentence is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    75 As indicated above, the effective overall sentence was of imprisonment for 11 years, eight months and six days, with a non-parole period of nine years, four months and six days. On behalf of the applicant it was contended that the aggregation of sentences produced a result that was manifestly excessive and that error can be seen in the combination of matters already dealt with and also by reason of the extent of accumulation of sentences. 
     
      
    76 Having regard to the views I have already expressed, the first basis for the applicant’s contention cannot be sustained. There remains the question of accumulation and/or concurrence. The sentence imposed in respect of Count 2 was completely accumulated upon the sentence the applicant was already serving, once his parole was revoked on 31 January 2005. (The applicant thereafter was in custody referable to the previous offence until 12 February 2005.) The sentences imposed in respect of Counts 3 and 4 were fully accumulated upon that imposed in respect of Count 2. The non-parole period of the sentence imposed in respect of Count 4 expires on 19 March 2008; the sentence imposed in respect of Count 1 was specified to commence on 20 June 2007, making that sentence cumulative other than a nine month period of concurrency. 
     
      
    77 Whether or not to accumulate sentences is essentially a matter of discretion for the sentencing judge: R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66; R v Keen [2004] NSWCCA 86. However, it is commonly accepted that, where a series of related offences are committed as part of a single enterprise, it is more likely that the sentences will, to some extent, be specified to be served at least partially concurrently. Compliance with the dictates of Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 demands that an appropriate sentence in respect of each offence be fixed. Compliance with sentencing principle also requires that the overall sentence reflect the totality of the criminality. Here, the overall criminality was very high indeed. The episode continued over several hours and involved the use of an axe, as well as the two knives. Two victims were intimidated, one of them intellectually impaired, the other suffering some physical disability. The latter was assaulted. As I have already mentioned, the offence of using offensive weapons to avoid apprehension was a very serious manifestation of offences of its kind. 
     
      
    78 I have already expressed the view that none of the individual sentences has been shown to have been manifestly excessive; the only remaining question is whether the accumulation resulted in a manifestly excessive overall term. I have come to the view that it did. 
     
      
    79 In my opinion, an appropriate term which the applicant ought to serve consists of a head sentence of nine years, with a non-parole period of six years. The sentences ought to be adjusted to achieve that overall result. In sentencing I would propose a more conventional selection of sentences in round figures. 
     
      
     The sentence I propose in respect of the assault is a fixed term. That is because, having regard to the lengthy time the applicant will, in any event, serve, fixing a non-parole period would serve no purpose.80 Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) leave to appeal against sentences granted; 
       
       
      (ii) appeal allowed, sentences quashed, and the applicant be re-sentenced as follows:

    81 ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Simpson J and the orders her Honour proposes.  
     
      
    82 I join in the orders proposed by Simpson J and generally with the reasons of her Honour.  
     
      
    83 The applicant embarked upon a course that resulted in the terrorising of two victims, one in his own home and, in circumstances of the similar prior offences, these offences deserve condign punishment.  
     
      
    84 I agree with all that her Honour has said as to the principles to be applied. Particular emphasis needs to be added to the error in comparing the facts in R v Hoerler, infra, and the stabbing of the dog. The circumstances in R v Hoerler are incomparable, even to most other murders.  
     
      
    85 The principles of the criminal law require obedience to the legal prescriptions of behaviour enacted by the legislature or arising from common law. The onus is placed on police and other law enforcement agencies to ensure that the law is upheld. The law (both statute and common law) regard the use of weapons endangering police in order to prevent lawful detention as requiring a sentence that pays particular attention to general deterrence.  
     
      
    86 The categorisation of the objective gravity of a particular offence is an exercise of judgment on which reasonable minds will differ. The well-known principles applicable to appeals against the exercise of discretionary judgments apply to preclude an appeal court from interfering unless the categorisation is not open.  
     
      
    87 The categorisation of this offence under s33B(1)(a) as being in the worst category was, on the view I take, not open to Gibb DCJ. In that opinion, I am in agreement with Simpson J. However, I do not accept that a sentence of 11½ years (in circumstances where the maximum is 12 years) is appropriate for anything other than the worst category of cases and therefore cannot accept it as an appropriate starting point in this case.  
     
      
    88 I accept that the killing of the police dog was an aggravating feature because Gibb DCJ found, as a fact, that it was “not an instinctive muscular response but a deliberate act”. Her Honour’s finding, in that regard, was open and ought not be disturbed. In other circumstances, a different result may be appropriate.  
     
      
    89 Notwithstanding my view as to the starting point of 11 ½ years for Count 1, in the circumstances of the accumulation of sentences and the overall sentence imposed, I join in the orders proposed by Simpson J.  
     
      
       
       ********** 
       
      
     
     
      
      
     ADDENDUM 
    McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with the addendum proposed by Simpson J.SIMPSON J: Judgment in this matter was delivered on 5 February 2007. On 12 February 2007 a letter was received in the registry of the Court of Criminal Appeal from the legal representatives of the applicant. The letter pointed out an inconsistency between the intention stated in para [79] of the judgment (to impose an overall term of imprisonment consisting of a head sentence of nine years, with a non-parole period of six years) and the result achieved by the sentence specified in the table to para [80] in which, by reason of the accumulation of sentences and the starting date of the sentence imposed in respect of Count 1, which results in an overall term of a head sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of six years and eight months. Representatives of the Director of Public Prosecutions agreed that the inconsistency existed, and ought be referred to this Court.Regrettably, the communication was not drawn to the attention of any member of the Court until late May 2007. It is for that reason that the correction, which ought to be made, has not yet been made.  
     
      
       
      The anomaly will be corrected by substituting, in respect of Count 1, a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years, commencing on 13 February 2005 (instead of 13 October 2005, as originally stated) and expiring on 12 February 2011, with a balance of term of three years expiring on 13 February 2011. This produces a head sentence of nine years in respect of that offence, in place of the eight years and four months previously specified, but, by reason of the earlier commencement date, not extending the overall length of the term, and achieving the intention stated in para [79]. 
       
       
      It is recognised that this does not achieve the intention to impose sentences that recognise the applicant’s criminality by a measure of accumulation. Given the relatively short terms of the earlier sentences, and the significantly longer term necessary in relation to Count 1, it is not possible so to accumulate. 
       
       
      The order of the Court is: 
       
       
      (i) leave to appeal against sentences granted; 
       
       
      (ii) appeal allowed, sentences quashed, and the applicant be re-sentenced as follows:

    1 SULLY JA: I agree with Howie JA. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE JA: This a summons by the Director of Public Prosecutions (the Director) seeking relief in the nature of certiorari and other consequential orders in respect of a decision of Mahoney ADCJ (the Judge) to take no action in respect of breaches of five bonds to which the first opponent (the offender) was subject under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (the Act). Except for one matter of detail, to which I shall refer later, the relief sought is not opposed. 
     
      
    3 The offender was convicted in the Local Court of three offences of break, enter and steal and two offences of malicious damage. The offences were committed between December and February 2005. On 5 September 2005 at Liverpool Local Court a magistrate sentenced the offender on each of the break, enter and steal offences to imprisonment for 15 months with a non-parole period of 10 months, and for each of the malicious damage offences to imprisonment for 6 months. Each of the sentences of imprisonment was suspended on condition that the offender enter into a bond in accordance with s 12 of the Act. There was a condition of the bond requiring the offender to undertake drug and alcohol rehabilitation. The offender was also ordered to pay compensation. 
     
      
    4 On 3 February 2006 the offender was arrested for an offence of malicious wounding while in company. The offence arose out of fight in which he participated with a co-offender outside the Cabramatta Railway Station. It was alleged that the offender with his co-offender kicked and punched the victim causing him facial injuries some of which required sutures. 
     
      
    5 The offender pleaded guilty to that offence in the Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence. There was no dispute that the offence for which he was to be sentenced by the Judge was a breach of the requirement of each of the bonds that the offender be of good behaviour. Section 98 of the Act relevantly provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        98 Proceedings for breach of good behaviour 
         
         
        (1) If it suspects that an offender may have failed to comply with any of the conditions of a good behaviour bond:  
         
          
          (a) the court with which the offender has entered into the bond, or  
           
          (b) any other court of like jurisdiction, or  
           
          (c) with the offender’s consent, any other court of superior jurisdiction,  
          
         
        may call on the offender to appear before it. 
         
        
       
       ……………………………… 
       
        
         
        (1C) For the purposes of subsection (1) (c), a court is of superior jurisdiction to the court with which an offender has entered into a good behaviour bond if it is a court to which the offender has (or has had) a right of appeal with respect to the conviction or sentence from which the bond arises. 
         
         
        (2) If it is satisfied that an offender appearing before it has failed to comply with any of the conditions of a good behaviour bond, a court:  
         
          
          (a) may decide to take no action with respect to the failure to comply, or  
           
          (b) may vary the conditions of the bond or impose further conditions on the bond, or  
           
          (c) may revoke the bond.  
          
         
         
        (3) In the case of a good behaviour bond referred to in section 12, a court must revoke the bond unless it is satisfied:  
         
          
          (a) that the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature, or  
           
          (b) that there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 It is clear that pursuant to s 98(1)(c) the Judge had jurisdiction to deal with the breach of the bonds notwithstanding that that they were entered with the Local Court because the offender agreed to the District Court dealing with the matters when sentencing him for the wounding offence.  
     
      
    7 The Judge ultimately determined to impose a sentence of imprisonment for 18 months upon the offender for the wounding offence but suspended that sentence upon the offender entering into a bond under s 12. He also determined not to take any action in respect of the breaches of the five bonds. With respect to the sentence imposed for the wounding offence the Crown has appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act. That appeal was to be heard at the same time as the summons. 
     
      
    8 Section 98(3) of the Act requires that a court revoke a bond under s 12 unless one of either two findings are made: that the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature or that there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. Here the failure to comply with the conditions of each of the bonds was the commission of the wounding offence, a breach of the condition to be of good behaviour. Therefore, unless the Judge was satisfied that the failure to be of good behaviour was trivial or that there were good reasons for excusing that failure, s 99 of the Act operated with the consequence that the order suspending the sentence ceased to have effect and certain consequential provisions of the Act applied. The operation of s 99 and the power of a court under that section were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Tolley [2004] NSWCCA 165 and R v Graham (2004) 62 NSWLR 252. They need not be considered further in this judgment. 
     
      
    9 In his sentencing remarks the Judge gave reasons for not taking action on the breach of the bonds. They were somewhat discursive but were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Crown has kindly drawn my attention to the fact that under s 98(3) the Court is directed by the Parliament to revoke any such bond unless it is satisfied either that the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial or that there are good reasons for excusing the offender's failure to comply with the condition of the bond and the Crown has quite rightly submitted that the commission of this offence on the night in question, 3 February 2006 could hardly be regarded as a trivial failure to comply with the conditions of those five bonds. He has also submitted that there would not be any grounds for this Court in coming to a finding that there are any good reasons for excusing his failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. At that stage I am constrained to depart from the submission of the Crown. In my view there are very good reasons for not taking any action on the breach of the bond. Those reasons can best be summarised this way: the whole purpose and structure of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as I understand it is designed not only to punish where punishment is necessary and not only to punish in a condign fashion where condign punishment is necessary but also to ensure that the Court visits every possible avenue of sentencing which could be visited short of imposing a full time custodial sentence if the circumstances of the case merit such lesser form of punishment than full time custodial sentence. 
         
         
        In this case the man without the record seems to me to have been the main aggressor. He was the one who had the cause for offering to fight. He was the larger of the two aggressors. I did not bother to look at the video. It is there if anyone else ever wants to look at it, as Exhibit B but I am satisfied I can adequately deal with the case by confining myself to the written word of the evidence on these pleas. As I said he was bigger. He was the main aggressor and he was the younger. He was the one who was insulted and Cooke just went along because his friend decided to involve himself. Cooke is the one with the record. As I have said Cooke's five prior convictions all seem to me to have been senseless offences no doubt committed when he was under the severe influence of alcoholic liquor, if not of drugs as well, committed in places where there was no personal violence offered to anyone at times of the day I think when there was nobody else about. They demonstrated that he was leading a very unstructured life and some evidence that Cooke gave in this Court today seems to me to be very important to bear in mind. 
         
         
        On the night in question he was not the one who had been insulted. He was older than the one who was insulted. The younger one was the fellow who in effect called out the victim and suggested that there be a fight. In the ordinary course of events, one would expect that the older would try and restrain the younger or if he could not restrain him from getting into the fight would walk away from it or stay out of it, but he did not and I think perhaps the explanation as to why he did what he did on the night in question can very easily be identified in one particular sentence in an answer he gave today. It was not a direct answer to the question. It just seemed to be an add on to something else he said but his words were, ""It's hard to have no friends"". 
         
         
        What took place on this night was aimless. It was reprehensible but it was understandable when one looks at the personal background of the two offenders with the lack of a male role model, at least during their formative years, with problems with work, problems at school. Both of them say that their schooling cut out in year nine. The younger one was expelled from school because of his disruptive conduct. The older one preferred to drink with his friends rather than go to school and apply himself to personal improvement. There is a very, very great need for both of these young men to get all of the assistance they possibly can at this stage of their life and to get it urgently; to get it from a government instrumentality; to get it under circumstances where they have got a sentence hanging over their heads knowing that it is up to them to respond positively to the assistance that is going to be provided to them by the Probation and Parole officers; and knowing that if they do not cooperate with the Probation and Parole officers then the next stop is going to be into gaol. 
         
         
        For all of the above reasons I have come to the conclusion that I have already foreshadowed that the appropriate sentence for this is a term of imprisonment for eighteen months. 
        
       
      
    10 Later, after the Judge had imposed sentence on the offender, he stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………And for the reasons previously expressed, this in relation to you Mr Cooke, I take no action on the breaches and if I could seek to summarise those reasons, they are: that the range of sentencing options open to me as against the need that I see that you have for being guided and assisted along the path to rehabilitation militate against my taking any action on the breaches of the bond. But that does not mean that I regard those five previous offences as being matters of no consequence. 
        
       
      
    11 The offences for which the offender had been before the Local Court were attacks upon premises, in two cases shops and in the third a TAFE building, where the offender gained entry by smashing a window and then stole or damaged property. The offences were committed while the offender was drunk. 
     
      
    12 The evidence before the Judge was that the offender, who was aged 20, had an alcohol and cannabis problem for which he had received assistance in a rehabilitation course called Triple Care, run by Mission Australia. He gave evidence before the Judge that he had made a little progress but needed further assistance. He saw a counsellor once a fortnight. He had employment with a tree lopping service although there was not regular work available to him. He expressed some remorse for the offence. There was in evidence a supportive reference from the counsellor at Triple Care as to the progress made by the offender but it failed to acknowledge the further offence or the fact that it was committed while the offender was under the influence of alcohol. 
     
      
    13 Before this Court would intervene in what was largely a discretionary judgment made by the Judge, the Director must show that there has been an error of law appearing on the face of the record of the court. The record for this purpose includes the reasons expressed by the Judge for his determination: see s 69(4) of the Supreme Court Act. It is not enough that this Court would have exercised the jurisdiction differently or that errors of fact or reasoning appear in the judgment of the court below. The Director asserted that the error of law was fundamental to the determination to take no action on the breach of the bonds because the reasons given by the Judge for excusing the breach of the bonds could not amount to “good reasons” within the terms of s 98(3)(b) of the Act. 
     
      
    14 A question then arises as to the extent of the power conferred on a court under s 98(3)(b) to excuse a breach of a bond entered into pursuant to s 12. It should be noted at the outset that what the court is required to consider is whether there are good reasons to excuse the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond in circumstances where that failure is not trivial in nature. The focus must principally be upon the behaviour giving rise to the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond and whether that behaviour should be excused. 
     
      
    15 The Judge during his sentencing remarks in the longer passage set out above indicated that he had reached the conclusion that “there are very good reasons for not taking any action on the breach of the bond”. That is, with respect, not answering the question posed by the section and the difference seems to me to be more than mere semantics. I accept that, if the court concludes that there are good reasons to excuse the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond, it follows that the court will take no action on the breach. But as I have noted already, the principal consideration raised by s 98(3)(b) is the conduct giving rise to the failure and whether that conduct can be excused. A conclusion that there were good reasons for not taking action on the breach of the bond may be found in considerations other than the conduct giving rise to the breach. For example, a decision not to take action on the breach may be based upon the subjective circumstances of the offender at the time of the proceedings for revocation of the bond. Yet that is a matter that, in my opinion, is irrelevant to a determination under s 98(3)(b). 
     
      
    16 Clearly if there are extenuating circumstances of sufficient importance to explain the behaviour giving rise to the breach, the court can exercise its jurisdiction to take no action on the breach. So, for example, if the breach is the failure to report to a probation officer there might be good reasons to excuse that failure if the offender had some acute personal problem at the time such as illness or a death in the family. If the breach is a further offence, the failure to be of good behaviour might be excused because of extenuating circumstances leading to the offending behaviour. An example might be driving under the influence of alcohol in an emergency situation. In such a case the court is considering whether the conduct represents a contumelious act of defiance or disregard of the conditions of the bond entered into with the court. 
     
      
    17 There is a live issue as to the extent, if any, to which a court can have regard to matters other than the behaviour giving rise to the breach in determining whether to excuse the breach, such as the impact upon the offender of the consequences of the breach. The issue was considered by Hidden J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Burrow [2004] NSWSC 433. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [24] The question posed by s 98(3)(b) is whether “there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond”. Where the breach of the conditions of the bond is a further offence, this requires the court to focus upon the circumstances of that offence. Mr Lakatos postulated the example of a man who drives with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood, but only for the purpose of taking his pregnant wife to hospital after she has unexpectedly gone into labour. That could well be such a case, although this is not to suggest that para (b) is confined to offences with extenuating circumstances of that kind. It is a matter about which generalisation is not possible, and whether the paragraph might properly be invoked must depend on the facts of the case at hand. 
         
         
        [25] Where the offence is relatively minor, it might be appropriate to weigh its gravity against the consequences of revocation of the bond, particularly where the suspended sentence is a long one. One of the matters to which King CJ had regard in Marston (at 322) was the “marked disproportion between the seriousness of the breaching offence and the length of the sentence which is activated by the revocation of the suspension”. (Of course, I am not speaking here of offences which are trivial in their nature, for which separate provision is made in para (a).) 
         
         
        [26] An assessment of the seriousness of the offence constituting the breach may require that regard be had to the offender’s subjective circumstances. However, in my view, para (b) does not permit the excuse of such a breach by reason only of his or her subjective circumstances at the time a court is considering revocation of the bond. Nor, it seems to me, can the court have regard to the severity of the penalty to be imposed for the fresh offence. 
         
        
       
      
    18 The reference to Marston in that passage is a reference to R v Marston (1993) 60 SASR 320. That was a decision of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal concerned with a section, not dissimilar to s 98, giving a court power to refrain from taking action on a bond where the non-compliance was trivial or “that there were proper grounds upon which the failure should be excused”. In that case the offender had been given a suspended sentence for an offence of armed robbery. In breach of the bond entered into by the offender as a pre-condition for the suspension of the sentence, she had been convicted of larceny of two muffins and a butter knife. The court accepted that the offence was committed on the spur of the moment because she was hungry. King CJ described her criminality for the behaviour giving rise to the breach in this way: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is clear that the appellant's impulsive actions were not motivated by any settled resolve to behave dishonestly, although, of course, necessarily there was dishonesty involved in the offence, but rather by a foolish and somewhat irresponsible inclination to satisfy her hunger by means of the muffins which were displayed on the breakfast table, and of course by using the knife to spread the butter on them. 
        
       
      
    19 The Court, in deciding that the Judge in revoking the bond had erred in the exercise of discretion, placed significant weight, not only on the circumstances of the behaviour giving rise to the breach, but also on the “marked disproportion between the seriousness of the breaching offence and the length of the sentence which is activated if the suspension is revoked”. King CJ, with whom Duggan J agreed, concluded at 321: 
     
      
       
        
         
        For my part, I think that the activation of a severe sentence for robbery with violence is not justified by the relatively minor nature of the offending which constitutes the breach. I think that that consideration, together with the evidence of the psychological problems confronting this appellant, constitute proper grounds upon which the failure to comply with the condition of the bond to be of good behaviour should be excused. I think that the learned judge was in error in the way in which the discretion was exercised. 
         
        
       
      Perry J also agreed in substance with the reasons of the Chief Justice. 
       
      
    20 It is unnecessary in order to determine the present matter to form a decided view on whether the approach taken in Marston should be followed in this State in applying s 98(3)(b). Although the wording of the relevant sections in the two jurisdictions is similar, there are two important differences between the regime in place in South Australia when Marston was decided and the regime in place in this State. Firstly a suspended sentence is more restricted in this State because it can be given for no more than two years. The sentence suspended in Marston was one of three years. Secondly, and perhaps more significantly, the impact of the revocation of the bond can be ameliorated in this State by ordering that the sentence that is enlivened by the breach be served by periodic detention or home detention. There has also been a recent change to the legislation so that the non-parole period is fixed at the date of revocation and not when the sentence was passed but suspended: see ss 12(3) and s 99(1)(c)(ii). These differences indicate to me that, assuming that a court could take into account the impact of the revocation of the bond, it would be a rare case indeed in which it would be appropriate to do so in this State. 
     
      
    21 But two matters should be emphasised from Marston: firstly the determination under s 98(3)(b) should be made bearing firmly in mind that generally a breach of the conditions of the bond will result in the offender serving the sentence that was suspended and, secondly, the principal consideration, if not the only one, is upon the conduct giving rise to the breach. As to the first of those matters King CJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I repeat what I said in R v Buckman (1987) 47 SASR, 303 at 304: ""There is a clear legislative policy that in general a breach of a condition of a recognizance upon which a sentence has been suspended, should result in the offender serving the sentence which was suspended. A sentence of imprisonment is imposed and suspended only where imprisonment is fully merited but the court considers it appropriate to give the offender a last chance to avoid imprisonment by leading a law abiding life. It is intended to be a sanction suspended over the head of the offender which is to be activated if there is a lapse into non law abiding ways. The court will not lightly interfere with the ordinary consequence of a breach of the recognisance."" 
         
         
        It is of great importance that the courts adhere to that principle. Departure from it by the nonrevocation of suspended sentences tends to undermine the integrity of the system of suspended sentences and their effectiveness as a means of deterring future offenders. 
         
        
       
      
    22 Perry J stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I agree with the observations which have fallen from His Honour the Chief Justice. In doing so, I would repeat the comments which I made in R v Lawrie, (unreported) (Court of Criminal Appeal) 16 November 1992, judgment No S3704: ""To excuse or vary the consequences of the breach of bond, the grant of which resulted in the suspension of a term of imprisonment, has a tendency to undermine the integrity of the sentencing process generally. It follows that the power to do so should be exercised sparingly, and only in cases where proper grounds have clearly been made out."" 
         
        
       
      
    23 With respect I would endorse those sentiments. There is nothing more likely to bring suspended sentences into disrepute than the failure of courts to act where there has been a clear breach of the conditions of the bond by which the offender avoided being sent to prison. Notwithstanding what has been stated about the reality of the punishment involved in a suspended sentence, if offenders do not treat the obligations imposed upon them by the bond seriously and if courts are not rigorous in revoking the bond upon breach in the usual case, both offenders and the public in general will treat them as being nothing more than a legal fiction designed to allow an offender to escape the punishment that he or she rightly deserved. 
     
      
    24 As King CJ pointed out, it should not be forgotten that before suspending a sentence the court must have reached the view that nothing but a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate to punish the offender for that crime: see R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. The suspended sentence is not an alternative to a bond and should not be treated as such. The suspension of the sentence of imprisonment was an act of mercy designed to assist the offender’s rehabilitation or for some other purpose to benefit the offender on the understanding that, if the offender did not fulfil the conditions of the bond, the sentence would be imposed. Therefore, generally speaking, there can be no unfairness in requiring the offender to serve the sentence when the obligations under the bond have been breached. 
     
      
    25 Whatever else might be said about the reasons of the Judge in the present case, there appears to be no consideration at all of the policy behind suspended sentences. Nor is there any obvious appreciation of the intention of Parliament, that is made clear from the special provisions made for bonds under s 12 and the need for “good reasons” to be found, that in the ordinary case a failure to comply with the conditions of the bond will result in its revocation. The court does not determine the existence of good reasons in a vacuum. It does so in the context of the policy and purpose behind the suspended sentence regime and by recognising that by excusing the breach the implicit threat made to the offender at the date of the imposition of the suspended sentence will not be carried out. If the realisation of this threat is avoided in inappropriate cases, it can only result in the lowering of respect for the orders of the court by the offender and the public in general. 
     
      
    26 However, there seem to me to be more obvious errors of law in the approach undertaken by the Judge, as was conceded by Ms Francis on behalf of the offender. As Hidden J noted in Burrows, the sentence to be imposed for the offence giving rise to the breach cannot be taken into account in determining whether to revoke the bond. The penalty to be imposed for the offending behaviour is simply irrelevant to the determination of whether good reasons exist to excuse the breach. Of course a consideration of the seriousness of the behaviour giving rise to the breach and what that behaviour discloses about the attitude of the offender with regard to the obligations imposed by the bond will be relevant both to a determination whether to revoke the bond and to an assessment of the sentence to be imposed for the offence giving rise to the breach. But they have different roles to play in the exercise of the discretions arising from the two proceedings. In sentencing for the offence they may indicate, for example, the need for a penalty reflecting specific deterrence. But this is a matter that has no relevance in determining whether to excuse the breach. 
     
      
    27 It is important that a court in the position of the Judge in the present case recognise that there are two distinct jurisdictions being exercised when determining the sentence for an offence that is also a breach of a s 12 bond. Each jurisdiction requires the court to exercise a discrete and independent discretion. Of course they are not completely independent jurisdictions and the exercise of the discretion to revoke the bond might indirectly influence the sentencing discretion. For example, if the court determines to revoke the bond and the sentence previously suspended thereby comes into operation, the court would not then have the power to impose a suspended sentence for the offence that brought about the breach, even if that were thought to be an otherwise appropriate sentence: see s 12(2) of the Act. There are other ways in which the decision under s 98(3)(b) can indirectly affect the sentence to be imposed for the offence by making a sentencing option either unavailable or inappropriate. 
     
      
    28 It is clearly preferable that, wherever possible, the one court should consider both the breach and the sentence for the offence causing the breach: there may be overlapping findings of fact to be made in the two proceedings and questions of totality would arise if the bond were revoked and a further term of imprisonment imposed for the offence. But it is of crucial importance that the breach proceedings be resolved before the sentence is imposed for the offence. This is because, as I have indicated, the result of the breach proceedings can affect the sentence to be imposed for the offence but the sentence for the offence is irrelevant to a determination of whether there are good reasons to excuse the breach.  
     
      
    29 This is not what happened in the present case and it is a good example of how the proceedings can miscarry if the court does not keep the two issues to be decided separate and distinct. It is obvious from both the reasons given for excusing the failure under s 98(3)(b) and the manner in which the Judge approached the issue of whether to excuse the breach that the sentence for the wounding offence was determined before the issue of the breach was resolved. The judge decided to excuse the breach in order to give effect to the sentence he imposed for the offence. This resulted in the Judge failing to ask himself the correct question in relation to the breach proceedings and in determining those proceedings by taking into account exclusively an irrelevant consideration. 
     
      
    30 In the longer passage of the sentencing remarks quoted above the Judge answers the Crown contention that there are no good reasons to excuse the breach by, firstly, a consideration of the sentencing principles espoused in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and next a consideration of issues of parity between the applicant and his co-offender. Both of these matters might have been relevant to assessing the sentence for the offence but they had absolutely nothing to do with deciding whether the breach should be excused. 
     
      
    31 The Local Court had determined that suspended sentences should be imposed for the break, enter and steal and malicious damage offences. The Judge could not determine that there were good reasons for excusing the breach on the basis that it was inappropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment on the offender for those offences. Considerations relevant to determining whether to breach the bond did not include the necessity for the applicant to be rehabilitated rather than imprisoned. The Local Court in deciding to impose the suspended sentences no doubt took that matter into account and the Judge was not sitting by way of appeal from the decision of the magistrate to impose the suspended sentences. Reflections on the policy of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or an acknowledgment that a sentence of imprisonment should be a last resort were irrelevant considerations in determining whether the breach should be excused. 
     
      
    32 There is another error of law apparent in the Judge’s reasons that resulted from the approach taken by the Judge in determining the sentencing proceedings first and then the breach proceedings. In the shorter quote from the sentencing remarks above, the Judge, when summarising his reasons for not revoking the bonds, referred to the “range of sentencing options open to me”. Putting aside the question of whether the Judge was entitled to take into account the impact of the consequences of the revocation of the bond, it is clear that the Judge erroneously limited his consideration of the options available to him on revocation of the bond by his determination of the sentence for the offence. The reference to the “range of sentencing options” can only be understood by having regard to the Judge’s findings in his remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    33 The Judge thought that by reasons of parity he could not impose on the offender a sentence harsher than that imposed upon the co-offender. Yet the co-offender was not eligible for periodic detention or community service. Therefore, so his Honour reasoned, he could not impose either of those sentencing options or a harsher sentence on the offender. It is inappropriate to analyse further the Judge’s reasoning in determining the sentence to impose for the wounding offence because that sentence is subject to a Crown appeal. But the point for present purposes is that the Judge considered that it was a relevant factor in determining the breach proceedings that he was limited in some way by the sentencing options open to him for the wounding offence and the need, as he saw it, to assist with the rehabilitation of the offender. Again they were extraneous considerations when exercising the functions under s 98(3)(b). 
     
      
    34 Hidden J in Burrows held that the subjective circumstances of the offender are generally irrelevant in determining whether there are good reasons to excuse the breach under s 98(3)(b) except to the extent that those subjective circumstances are relevant to a consideration of the breach itself. So, for example, the fact that the offender suffers from a mental disorder that may account for the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond will be a relevant factor in determining whether to excuse the breach: see Marston. But subjective features of the offender at the time of the breach proceedings are irrelevant to the decision whether good reasons exist to excuse the breach. They may of course have some role to play in what order is made after revocation when determining whether the consequential sentence is to be served by way of full-time custody, or an available alternative and the length of the non-parole period to be imposed. But they cannot affect the decision whether to revoke the bond. 
     
      
    35 In the present case it was an error of law for the Judge to take into account the need for rehabilitation of the offender by supervision of the probation service when deciding whether to excuse the breach. The error is a result of the Judge both approaching the determination of the breach proceedings in light of the sentence imposed for the wounding offence and by determining the breach proceedings by focusing on the consequences of the revocation of the bond to the exclusion of any other consideration. 
     
      
    36 Put simply the relief sought in the summons must be granted because the reasons given by the Judge for taking no action on the breach could not at law amount to good reasons for excusing the breach under s 98(3)(b). Further, there is nothing in the sentencing remarks that could possibly amount to good reasons under s 98(3)(b) and thus it follows that there is no basis upon which the court could exercise a discretion to refuse to quash the determination of the Judge to take no action on the breach. 
     
      
    37 The question then arises as to what course should be taken by way of consequential orders. The Director seeks to have the breach proceedings remitted to the District Court. The applicant asks the Court to remit them to the Local Court on the basis that he will no longer consent to the jurisdiction of the District Court. The Director in the alternative asked the Court to exercise its power under s 23 of the Supreme Court Act and to deal with the question of whether the bonds should be revoked as a consequential order to its exercise of the power under s 69. That does not appear to me to be a practical course to take even if the Court had the power to exercise that jurisdiction. As a result of section 98(1C) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act this Court is not a “court of superior jurisdiction” for the purposes of s 98(1)(c) with the result that this Court has no jurisdiction to deal with the breach under that Act even with the consent of the offender. But in any event, if this Court were to determine the breach proceedings, such a course would deprive the offender of any appeal against the order revoking the bond or any order made as a consequence of the revoking of the bond that might lie against orders made either in the District Court or the Local Court depending upon where the breach proceedings are heard and determined. 
     
      
    38 It seems to me that the appropriate course is to quash the determination of the Judge to take no action on the breach and to remit the matter to the District Court because it is the record of that court that has been brought into this Court by the summons and it is the orders of that court that are being quashed. If the offender purports to withdraw consent to the District Court’s further hearing the breach proceedings, it will be a matter for that court to determine where the breach proceedings will be heard. 
     
      
    39 The orders I propose are that: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The record of the District Court sitting in its criminal jurisdiction at Campbelltown in the proceedings before his Honour Acting Judge Mahoney QC on 28 September 2006 of Regina v Glen Cooke 06/21/3111 being proceedings for breach of five bonds entered pursuant to s 12 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
         on 5 September 2005 with the Liverpool Local Court be called up into this Court; 
        
       
       
        
        2. The determination by Mahoney ADCJ in those proceedings to take no action on the breach of the five bonds under s 98(2)(a) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
         is quashed; 
         
         
        3. The proceedings for the breach of the five bonds be remitted to the District Court for determination according to law.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant was convicted after trial by jury of two offences: an offence of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and an armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of that Act. The maximum penalty for each of the offences was imprisonment for twenty years. The standard non-parole period provisions did not apply. On 9 December 2005 Judge Hughes sentenced the applicant on each count to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 6 years to date from 9 May 2005 with a balance of term of 2 years. 
     
      
    3 At the time he was sentenced the applicant was serving a sentence imposed upon him by Judge Morgan on 26 April 2002. That sentence was seven years with a non-parole period of 4 years. That sentence commenced on 9 May 2001 and the non-parole period expired on 8 May 2005: see R v Nguyen [2002] NSWCCA 507. The sentence imposed by Judge Hughes was fully accumulative with that sentence, so that the overall sentence to be served by the applicant consists of a total term of 12 years with a non-parole period of ten years. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 8 May 2011. 
     
      
    4 The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The sentencing Judge erred in the accumulation of the non-parole period with that imposed by Judge Morgan and in failing to consider principles of totality 
         
         
        2. The sentencing Judge erred in his approach to s 44 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         and in failing to find that the accumulation constituted “special circumstances”. 
         
         
        3. In consequence of grounds 1 and/or 2 a different, less severe sentence is warranted and/or ought to be imposed. 
         
        
       
      
    5 The facts are that on 18 April 2001 the applicant and a co-offender entered a house at Lansvale. Alone in the premises at the time was a 29 year old female. The victim was about to leave the house to pick up her husband, who was returning from work, when the two offenders confronted her in the hallway. One was holding a long-bladed knife that was pointed towards her face and the other a large bag. The victim’s mouth was taped and her hands and feet bound with rope. She was forced to the floor. One of the offenders demanded money, jewellery and credit cards. She said that she had none and one of the men searched her wallet. A bag of some type was placed over the victim’s head so that she could not see other than through a small hole. Her car keys and pin number were demanded and her watch and two bankcards were taken. 
     
      
    6 The two men then picked up the victim and placed her on a bed. Her pockets were searched. The rope was then removed from her legs and her jeans and underwear removed. She said a number of times, “Don’t do that”. Each of the offenders then had sexual intercourse with her. Her clothing was replaced and her feet rebound. A jumper was placed over her head and the offenders left the house. The victim managed to free herself from the ropes and raise the alarm. 
     
      
    7 The offence for which Judge Morgan sentenced the applicant was committed on 9 May 2001. Judge Hughes described the offence as “a home invasion with weapons”. After he was placed in prison, a sample of DNA was taken from the applicant and eventually matched with DNA taken from the victim. This resulted in his being charged with these offences. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was 18 years of age at the time of the offences. As a result of his exposure to domestic violence in his childhood he turned to alcohol and drugs. He had no prior offences and the judge treated the applicant as a first offender and held that he should be presumed to have been of previous good character. The Judge took into account that the applicant had been using his period in custody “appropriately” and had been involved in courses addressing his misuse of alcohol and drugs and his offending behaviour. He had favourable reports in relation to his behaviour while in custody. A psychological report indicated that the applicant was suffering from a “major depressive disorder”. 
     
      
    9 There were in my opinion at least three significant errors in the exercise of Judge Hughes’s discretion in favour of the applicant. The first was the Judge’s assessment of the seriousness of the offences. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The crime of sexual intercourse without consent in company is a very serious offence. The crime of robbery with an offensive weapon is also a very serious offence and (sic) is noted by the maximum penalty involved. I find it more particularly serious when it takes place in a person’s own home. However I regard both the offences to be at the lower mid range of any scale constructed by the offences. There appears not to have been any roughness aside from the sexual assault itself that could damage the victim. However, of course, the sexual assault itself is such a horrific affair in one’s own home that will be conscious (sic) on the victim for many years. The serious nature of those offences are ones which should result in a prison sentence. 
        
       
      
    10 In my opinion neither offence could be described as “at the lower mid range” of seriousness. The armed robbery offence was aggravated by being planned, by being committed in company, by being committed in the victim’s home, and by the manner in which the victim was treated. Had the weapon used been a firearm it would have been a more serious offence under s 97(2). The sexual assault offence was aggravated by the threat to inflict actual bodily harm with the knife, the fact that it was committed in the victim’s home and that the victim was blindfolded and had her hand’s and feet bound. In those circumstances the fact that there was no additional “roughness” seems to me to have been of little, or no, significance. I would have thought that at least the sexual assault offence was in the upper seriousness of its kind. 
     
      
    11 It was an error of principle to make both offences totally concurrent. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Having regard to the fact that both offences were committed on the same day I am prepared to order that the sentences be served concurrently. 
        
       
      
    12 It seems obvious from a number of matters that have been before this Court recently, that there is abroad an insufficient understanding of the principles of totality and of the relevant factors to be taken into account when determining whether to order that sentences be served concurrently or made, at least, partially cumulative. There is no rule that sentences for offences committed on the same day or in the same criminal enterprise should be served concurrently. The issue has been considered in a number of decisions of this Court that should make it plain that the question to be asked is whether the criminality of one offence can be encompassed in the criminality of the other offence; see generally R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272. The position was explained in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        27 ….. there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both. 
         
        
       
      
    13 During the course of argument the Presiding Judge put to the applicant’s counsel a proposition to the following effect. The applicant and his co-offender having committed the armed robbery had two courses available to them. They could have decided that they had accomplished what they had set out to do by the robbery and could thereupon leave the premises with the property they had obtained. In any such case they would both have stood for sentence for that offence. Alternatively, they could have decided to take the opportunity to commit a further offence, this one of personal violence against their hapless victim and so they sexually assaulted her. Why then should they receive the same sentence as if they had left the premises after committing the robbery and without violating the complainant? Or to put the issue in terms of totality, how could it be thought that the criminality involved in the robbery could encompass the further serious criminality involved in the rape? The offences committed were of a completely different nature and each was individually of extreme gravity. The mere fact that they occurred in the same criminal episode or on the same day could not justify concurrent sentences. 
     
      
    14 The Judge gave the applicant the benefit of having no prior offences and of being of prior good character. Judge Morgan, also, sentenced the applicant on the basis that he was of previous good character. The applicant on the face of it received the benefit of that finding, whatever it meant in real terms, twice. This situation was considered in R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381. The Court held that, where after the offences for which sentence was being passed, the offender had committed other serious offences of a similar nature, little or no significance could be given to the fact that the offender had no prior convictions at the time of the commission of the offences for which he was being sentenced. In the circumstances of that case it was held that the fact that the offender had no prior offences could not be considered as a mitigating factor. 
     
      
    15 So it was here. In light of the fact that the applicant had committed another serious home invasion about three weeks later meant that there was no relevance in the fact that he was of prior good character before he committed the offences before his Honour. The present offences could not be considered as being aberrations or, in any other sense, foreign to the applicant’s character. Rather, the existence of the later offence militated against the applicant’s receiving leniency to which he might otherwise been entitled by reason of the fact that these were his first criminal offences. 
     
      
    16 In my opinion a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years was probably inadequate. This is so notwithstanding the applicant’s age and the delay in the matter’s being dealt with. That delay was due to the fact that the applicant’s guilt of the offences had to be discovered and then proved. There was no evidence to show that this delay had in anyway prejudiced the applicant. The applicant had no remorse and was entitled to no benefit that would have been the case had he pleaded guilty. Any advances he had made in his rehabilitation had to be seen in the light of his refusal to accept responsibility for these offences and that fact ought to have detracted from any favourable assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation and the unlikelihood of further offending. There was nothing in his personal circumstances that could explain, let alone mitigate, the offences he committed, particularly the sexual assault.  
     
      
    17 I accept the submission there was a further error by the Judge in failing to have any regard to the principle of totality so far as the accumulation of these sentences with the sentence imposed by Judge Morgan was concerned. The Judge ought to have taken into account the criminality involved in that offence and the fact that it was committed three weeks after the offences for which he was sentencing the applicant. The Judge also should have had regard to the overall non-parole period the applicant was to serve as a result of the accumulation of sentences and how that should affect a finding of special circumstances in order to result in an appropriate parole period. The ultimate sentence imposed resulted in a parole period that was out of proportion to the non-parole period particularly in light of the fact that the applicant was a young man with some issues that could be addressed by assistance on parole. This was a result of the failure of the Judge to consider whether the accumulation of sentences should itself have resulted in a finding of special circumstances, at least to preserve the statutory relationship between the overall non-parole period and the total term to be served by the applicant. 
     
      
    18 I would uphold the first two grounds of appeal. The issue then arises as to whether any lesser sentence was warranted: see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I am of the view that the sentencing discretion of the Judge miscarried in a number of ways. But I believe that overall the errors were significantly to the advantage of the applicant. Were I to resentence him the only possible result would be that the overall sentence would be increased to provide for a longer period on parole but I would specify an overall non-parole period of at least ten years. Notwithstanding the applicant’s young age and personal circumstances the offences for which he was before Judge Morgan and Judge Hughes were extremely serious and warranted a condign sentence for all the purposes of punishment including both personal and general deterrence. As the Court should not increase the sentence to provide for a longer period on parole the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    19 The sentence as imposed by Judge Hughes did not comply with the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act operative at the time the offences were committed. Section 44 of that Act had been amended since the date of the offences but that amendment only applied to offences committed after 1 February 2003. It has been held that errors of this kind are formal in nature but should be corrected by this Court. 
     
      
    20 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The application for leave to appeal is granted and the appeal allowed; 
         
         
        2. The sentences imposed by Judge Hughes are quashed; 
         
         
        3. On each count the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years to date from 9 May 2005. There is to be a non-parole period of 6 years to expire on 8 May 2011, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: This a stated case pursuant to s.5BA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which section provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        5BA Case stated from Land and Environment Court 
         
        (1) A Judge of the Land and Environment Court may submit any question of law arising on any appeal to the Land and Environment Court in its environmental offences appeals jurisdiction coming before the Judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination, and the Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the Land and Environment Court as it thinks fit. 
         
        (2) At the request of a person who was the appellant in an appeal referred to in subsection (1), a question of law may be submitted under that subsection to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination even though the appeal proceedings during which the question arose have been disposed of. The question of law must be submitted not later than 28 days after the end of the appeal proceedings, or within such longer period as the Court of Criminal Appeal may allow. 
         
        
       
      
    2 Since the time limit in s.5BA(2) was exceeded in this case, the applicant also applies for an extension of time.  
     
      
    3 Talbot J of the Land & Environment Court has stated the case as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. DETERMINATION:  
         
        On 26 April 2006 I ordered that  
         
        1. The Costs order made by the Court below be set aside;  
         
        2. The respondent pay the applicant's costs in the court below in the amount of $7,500 with credit to be given for the amount of $500 already paid;  
         
        3. The application for an order that the respondent pay the appellant's costs in this appeal is dismissed.  
         
        4. Each party pay their own costs on the Notice of Motion 5. Exhibits may be returned.  
         
         
        2. FACTS:  
         
        1. On 1 December 2005, I, whilst upholding an appeal from a decision of a Magistrate at Mullumbimby Local Court on 23 June 2005:  
        Cliftleigh Haulage Ply Ltd v Byron Shire Council  
        [2005] NSWLEC 692  
        (Cliftleigh No  
        1), ordered that no order for costs be made unless a Notice of Motion be filed within 7 days of the date of my decision.  
         
        2. Such a Notice of Motion was filed. I determined that Notice of Motion on 26 April 2006:  
        Cliftleigh Haulage Ply Ltd v Byron Shire Council  
        [2006] NSWLEC 197  
        (Cliftleigh No  
        2). A copy of both these decisions is annexed to this stated case.  
         
        3. The appellant had originally been charged with an offence under s 120 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (""PEO Act"").  
         
        4. The particulars of the charge related to car crushing activity causing pollutants to discharge into the ground and thereby cause water pollution. Initially particularised as having occurred between 30 July and I August 2004, the particulars were changed, on 21 April 2005, to cover the dates from 30 July to 5 August 2004.  
         
        5. The evidence of Council Officers was to the effect that they observed, on 1 August 2004, that cars had been crushed and were on the ground, whereas they were not in that condition on 30 July. The evidence was that there were no employees of the appellant at the site between 27 July and 3 August 2004. However, during that period, an excavator belonging to and used by the appellant in its usual crushing operations remained on site. The keys were left in the excavator:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        1 [9]  
         
        6. Mr Harrop was the occupier and part-owner of the subject land:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        1 [5]. Officers for the prosecutor did not take a statement from him and he was not called by the prosecutor to give evidence:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        1 [5],  
        Cliftleigh No  
        2 [14]. There had been a subpoena issued by the appellant for Mr Harrop's attendance, but he did not answer it. The appellant was cross-examined at first instance about his failure to call Mr Harrop:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        2 [15]. Because I could not determine what the outcome might have been if Mr Harrop could be called to give evidence, I found that it was not possible to make a positive finding, as I considered was required, about any of the matters set out in s 70 Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act (""the Act"").  
         
        7. The appellant asserted that nobody with authority to act for the company was present at the site at least between the dates 27 July and 3 August. At least so far as the principal of the appellant company, Mr Irvine, was concerned, I found he had log book entries that unequivocally showed he had left the subject site on 23 July and did not return until lunchtime 4 August:  
        Cliftleigh No 1  
        [28]  
         
        8. Additionally, Mr Irvine gave evidence that as far as he was aware, no employee of the appellant company was even there from 27 July to 3 August:  
        CliftleighNo 1  
        [30].  
         
        9. I found that the prosecutor had not established beyond reasonable doubt that any persons acting with the authority of the appellant company were at the site between 30 July and 3 August:  
        Cliftleigh No 1  
        [34].  
         
        10. I further found that in the face of denials on oath by two of the employees of the company that the prosecutor had not eliminated all of the plausible explanations for the crushing of the cars in the period between the visits by the Council officer:  
        Cliftleigh No 1  
        [35].  
         
        11. In determining the notice of motion:  
        Cliftleigh Haulage Pry Ltd v Byron Shire Council  
        [2006] NSWLEC 197  
        (Cliftleigh No  
        2), I made the following findings:  
         
        12. That there was no evidence that any person acting with the authority of the appellant company being present on the site during the relevant period:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        2 [9].  
         
        13. The appellant had argued that, by reason of a telephone conversation between Council Officers and Mr Irvine, and representations sent to the prosecutor on 22 February 2005, that the appellant had raised an alibi. The appellant further argued that having raised the alibi, it fell on the prosecutor to negative it. I found the appellant's argument in relation to the alibi misconceived for the following reasons:  
         
        a. The representations and telephone conversation merely asserted that there was no one acting with the authority of the company present on the site on 31 July 2004.  
         
        b. The only reference to proof of that assertion, was a reference to the means by which Mr Irvine's whereabouts on 31 July could be proved, and did not negative the prospect that other employees of the company were present and involved in the crushing work during the relevant period.  
         
        c. The amendment of the particulars to extend the relevant dates to between 30 July and 5 August meant that the representations asserting that Mr Irvine could prove he was elsewhere on 31 July could not, therefore, be a complete answer to the charge as he could have been present on other days:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        2 [11].  
         
        d. The letter was not accompanied by any proof, but was rather an assertion that the facts could easily be proved: [12].  
         
        14. I therefore concluded that it was entirely reasonable for the prosecutor to take the position that the appellant's evidence could be tested at trial rather than seek to undertake further investigations in response to the raising of the alibi:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        2 [13].  
         
        15. So far as the failure to call Mr Harrop, I found that no reason had been given for the failure by the prosecutor to call Mr Harrop. Yet he was a significant person of interest who apparently indicated he could give direct evidence of events that occurred during the relevant dates. I found, therefore, that the prosecution had failed to call a critical witness:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        2 [14].  
         
        16. However, I noted that counsel for the appellant at first instance had, through cross-examination, brought out part of a conversation which tended to suggest that if Mr Harrop had been called, the evidence he would have given would not have assisted the appellant:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        2 [16].  
         
        17. In  
        Cliftleigh No  
        1 I dealt with the issue of this hearsay evidence of what Mr Harrop was alleged: to have said: [21]-[26]. I noted that Mr Harrop was said to have told Council Officers that Mr Irvine had been conducting crushing works by crushing the cars with the excavator and taking them to Sydney. Although one of the Officers, Mr Hill, agreed with the proposition that Mr Harrop indicated that Mr Irvine crushed the cars on 31 July, the other, Mr Burnage said that no date had been specified.  
         
        18. There was no evidence that Mr Harrop was directly asked about the crushing of cars between 30 July and 1 August by the Council Officers:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        1 [36]. I found the suggestion from one of the Council Officers that Mr Harrop had specified a date to be unreliable in the context of proving that Mr Irvine or any other person acting for the company crushed cars on the site between the relevant dates:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        1 [34].  
         
        19. It was common ground that the appellant had been engaged in crushing work. However, the appellant denied undertaking any crushing work during the relevant period, or in the manner that lead to the pollution, being crushing cars on the ground:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        1 [35]. The appellant contended that its method of crushing such vehicles was very different, in that the vehicles were crushed in a container on the back of a truck to prevent pollutants from escaping from such vehicles into the ground:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        1 [12].  
         
        20. I therefore concluded, in relation to the second ground relied in support of the Notice of Motion, namely the failure of the prosecutor to call Mr Harrop, that I could not determine what the outcome would have been if he had been called to give evidence at first instance. I was not able to be satisfied that his evidence would have suggested the appellant might not be guilty or that the proceedings should not be brought:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        2 [17].  
         
         
        3. DETERMINATION:  
         
        I determined that I was, for the reasons outlined above, unable to make a positive finding that any of the matters set out in s 70 of the Act had been satisfied:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        2 [17]  
         
        I indicated that, had I not felt constrained in the way I set out by the provisions of s 70, I would have made an order in favour of the appellant for the costs of the appeal:  
        Cliftleigh No  
        2 [20]  
         
         
        4. QUESTIONS OF LAW:  
         
        The appellant contends that I have erred in law that I misapplied the appropriate test under s 70 of the Act  
         
        1. Did I err in law in finding that the requirements of s70 Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 had not been satisfied, thereby refusing to order costs in favour of the successful appellant?  
         
        2. Did I err in law in finding that the Appellant had not satisfied the test under s70(1)(a) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001?  
         
        3. Did I err in finding that, absent any evidence from the appellant regarding alibi, it was entirely reasonable for the prosecutor to take the position that the alibi evidence could be tested at trial, and not need to make his own enquiries, therefore that there was no unreasonable failure to investigate to satisfy s70(1)(c)?  
         
         
        5. The matter to be determined by the Court in whether my determination was erroneous in point of law. 
        
       
      
    4 The case involves the interpretation of s.70 of the Crimes (Local Courts and Appeal Review) Act 2001 which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        70 Limit on costs awarded against public prosecutor 
         
        (1) Costs are not to be awarded in favour of an appellant whose conviction is set aside unless the appeal court is satisfied:  
         
        (a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner, or 
         
        (b) that the proceedings in the Local Court were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith, or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner, or 
         
        (c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter:  
         
          
          (i) that the prosecutor was or ought reasonably to have been aware of, and 
           
          (ii) that suggested that the appellant might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought, or 
          
         
        (d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award costs in favour of the appellant. 
         
        (2) This section does not apply to the awarding of costs against a respondent acting in a private capacity. 
         
        (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), an officer of an approved charitable organisation (within the meaning of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979) is taken not to be acting in a private capacity if the officer acts as the respondent in any appeal arising from proceedings under that Act or section 9 (1) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2003. 
        
       
      
    5 The two judgments of Talbot J are annexed to the stated case.  
     
      
    6 It appears from them that the Council’s case before the Magistrate was that the observations of its officers of premises where the appellant conducted car-crushing observations, on 30 July 2004 (when no crushed cars were observed on the ground) and on 1 August 2004 (when crushed cars were observed on the ground), supported an inference that pollution-causing car-crushing activities had been carried out on the premises between these dates, and that those activities had been conducted by the appellant. 
     
      
    7 The appellant’s case was that none of its employees were on the site during that period, and that the method it used to crush cars would not have resulted in cars being on the ground as observed by Council officers.  
     
      
    8 In the result, Talbot J held that it was not established to the requisite standard that the appellant conducted the relevant activities.  
     
      
    9 During the hearing before the Magistrate, evidence was given by three Council officers of a conversation on 1 August 2004 with Mr. Harrop, occupier and part owner of the land in question, who said words to the effect that Mr. Irvine (the principal of the appellant) was crushing cars on the site, with no dates being specified. Under cross-examination, a question was put to each of the Council officers suggesting that Mr. Harrop had said that Mr. Irvine had been on the site on 31 July 2004, to which one of the officers said “Yes”, another said “I believe so yes” and the third said “I don’t think there was a date specified”.  
     
      
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
      
    10 Mr. Hammill SC for the appellant submitted that Talbot J erred in law in finding that the requirements of s.70(1)(a) and (c) were not satisfied. In relation to both paragraphs, the appellant relied on deficiencies in the Council’s investigation in relation to the witness Mr. Harrop and an alibi raised by the appellant.  
     
      
    11 In relation to Mr. Harrop, Mr. Hammill submitted that the Council should have enquired of him as to what he observed in relation to the crushing of cars between the nominated dates and whether any employee of the appellant was present on those dates; and should have taken a statement from him and called him as a witness, there being no reason advanced why this was not done. Talbot J rejected the Council’s argument that it was entitled to run its case as it saw fit, and that it was up to the defendant to call Mr. Harrop if it saw fit; and he found that Mr. Harrop was a significant person of interest who had apparently indicated he could give direct evidence of events during the relevant dates, and that the Council did not elect to call a critical witness. Mr. Hammill submitted that Talbot J’s reasons for not finding the requirements of s.70(1) satisfied, namely that he could not determine what the outcome would have been if Mr. Harrop had been called, indicated an erroneous construction of the section. Even if this could be a reason for not being satisfied that s.70(1)(c) was satisfied, it was not a reason for not being satisfied that s.70(1)(a) was satisfied. 
     
      
    12 In relation to alibi, Mr. Hammill submitted that a prosecuting authority has an obligation to investigate an alibi once it is raised, particularly because, once an alibi is put forward, the prosecution must negative it beyond reasonable doubt: Killick v. The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 565. Talbot J erred by proceeding on the basis that there needed to be proof of an alibi, disclosed to the prosecution, in order to enliven any obligation on the prosecutor to investigate an alibi. 
     
      
    13 Mr. Hammill referred to Latoudis v. Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534, and submitted that if the Council was to receive the benefit of the protection given by s.70, it should discharge responsibilities similar to those cast on the Director of Public Prosecutions, including conducting a reasonable investigation into an alibi provided by the defendant. 
     
      
    14 Mr. Wright for the Council submitted that it was open to Talbot J to conclude, on the material before him, that he could not make the positive findings advocated by the appellant under s.70(1)(a) and/or (c). It is not the case that an investigation must have been conducted unreasonably when a finding has been made that the prosecutor did not call a material or critical witness. Talbot J said he did not infer that the prosecution had unreasonably failed to investigate any matter.  
     
      
    15 Mr. Wright also submitted that the prosecution had put its case on alternative bases that did not require attendance by the appellant’s employees between 30 July and 1 August 2004, namely by reason of cars being crushed between 1 August and 4 August 2004, and by reason of crushing equipment being left in an operable state on the site.  
     
      
    16 He submitted that, even in relation to s.70(1)(a), the requirements were not satisfied unless the unreasonable manner of investigation was material to the bringing of the prosecution; so that the person seeking costs had to show that it led to a prosecution being brought which otherwise would or should have been brought. Accordingly, it was sufficient for Talbot J not to be satisfied what the outcome would have been if Mr. Harrop had been called.  
     
      
       
      DECISION 
      
    17 The relevant questions were whether the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable manner, or whether the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or investigate properly) any relevant matter. No question was raised as to whether the proceedings were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner, under par.(b) of s.70(1).  
     
      
    18 In my opinion, the submissions based on the failure to call Mr. Harrop at the hearing are therefore misconceived. That failure relates to the manner in which the proceedings were conducted, not to the investigation. In any event, the finding of Talbot J did not amount to a finding that the proceedings were conducted in an improper manner.  
     
      
    19 However, in my opinion there is force in the submission that, in investigating the matter, Council officers should have asked Mr. Harrop what he observed between the nominated dates in relation to the crushing of cars and the presence on site of the employees of the appellant, particularly after the appellant had asserted to the Council that Mr. Irvine was not at the site, and that no other person authorised by the appellant was at the site, at relevant times. Whether or not it would have been reasonable to rely on a circumstantial case before that assertion was made, it is certainly arguable that it was no longer reasonable after the assertion was made, in circumstances where there was a witness who may have been able to give direct evidence of what occurred.  
     
      
    20 As regards s.70(1)(c), it could be said that a person seeking costs must identify a matter that the prosecution was or ought to have been aware of and that suggested that the appellant might not be guilty or that the proceedings should not have been brought. If the “matter” in question here is that there was a possible eye-witness, then it was not shown that this matter suggested that the appellant might not be guilty. If the “matter” in question is the evidence that that witness could give, although it could be said that the Council should have been aware of it, it was not shown that this evidence suggested that the appellant might not be guilty. Accordingly, in relation to s.70(1)(c), I do not think error by the primary judge was shown.  
     
      
    21 However, in relation to s.70(1)(a), I do not think it is necessary for the person seeking costs in every case to show that an investigation conducted in a reasonable manner would have suggested that the appellant might not be guilty or that the proceedings ought not to be brought. If a prosecutor knows there are five eye-witnesses to an event, and interviews and calls only one of them, and the prosecution then fails, I think s.70(1)(a) may apply even if the person seeking costs does not prove what the other four witnesses would have said. Similarly, closer to this case, if the prosecutor knows there is an eye-witness to what happened, but does not interview this witness, and instead relies wholly on a circumstantial case, in my opinion s.70(1)(a) may be satisfied even if the person seeking costs does not prove what the eye-witness would have said.  
     
      
    22 The only relevant reason given by the primary judge for not finding s.70(1) satisfied in relation to Mr. Harrop was that he could not determine what the outcome would have been if Mr. Harrop had been called. In my opinion, this could not be a sufficient reason for determining that s.70(1)(a) does not apply. The primary judge did not give reasons that could justify such a determination, and in my opinion this amounts to an error of law. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion, there was no independent error of law in relation to alibi. The mere assertion on behalf of the appellant that no-one with the authority of the company was on the site on 31 July 2004, and that it could be proved that Mr. Irvine was elsewhere, did not as a matter of law necessarily require a conclusion that it was unreasonable for the Council not to investigate Mr. Irvine’s possible alibi or to enquire whether or not there were alibis for all other employees. Any requirement for the prosecution to disprove alibis beyond reasonable doubt only arises if there is evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt as to whether an accused was elsewhere at the time of the offence; and mere assertion by an accused person that there is an alibi is insufficient for this. If there was error by Talbot J on this aspect, it was an error of fact. 
     
      
    24 Accordingly, it will be necessary for Talbot J to reconsider the question under s.70(1)(a) in the light of these reasons: that is, it will be necessary for him to consider whether, having regard to the matters referred to in par.[19] of this judgment, the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable manner. 
     
      
    25 At present, I see no reason why the costs of this appeal should not follow the event, and I would so order. If the Council wishes to submit to the contrary, it should do so by written submissions within 7 days, with any response to be provided within a further 7 days. Otherwise the order made today would stand. 
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
      
    26 There is evidence that the appellant made a reasonable attempt to comply with the time limit in s.5AB, and in my opinion the time limit should be extended. 
     
      
    27 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      (1) Time limit extended to the date of filing of the stated case. 
       
      (2) The questions in the stated case answered: 
       
        
        1. Yes. 
         
        2. Yes. 
         
        3. No error of law. 
        
       
      (3) Matter remitted to Talbot J. 
       
      (4) The Council to pay the appellant’s costs of the stated case.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The appellant was convicted after trial by jury in the District Court of three counts of sexual assault committed against his estranged wife. Each of the offences arose from the one incident that occurred on 20 November 2004 in Queanbeyan. The first count alleged an offence contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900, an aggravated sexual assault, the circumstances of aggravation being the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm immediately before the intercourse. The second and third counts alleged offences contrary to s 61I of that Act, being offences of sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
    3 As a consequence of the convictions Judge Maguire (the Judge) sentenced the appellant to an overall sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 10 years with a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months. The sentences dated from 29 November 2004 and the appellant is eligible to be released to parole on 28 November 2014. 
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. The grounds of appeal in respect of conviction are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. [The Judge] erred when he gave directions which elevated neutral expert evidence of sexual assault and in so doing bolstered the credibility of the Complainant. 
         
         
        2. [The Judge] erred when he erroneously directed the jury on a question of fact. 
         
         
        3. [The Judge] erred when he directed the jury that purported injuries to the Complainant’s wrists were capable of amounting to corroboration and [the Judge] gave an inadequate Murray direction which resulted in unfair prejudice to the Appellant. 
         
         
        4. [The Judge’s] summing up was not balanced in that he failed to sum up the case for the defence adequately or at all. 
         
         
        5. The cumulative effects of grounds 1-4 is that the Appellant did not receive a fair trial according to law and there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
         
        
       
       
        
      The Crown case 
      
    5 The Crown case was as follows. The complainant and the appellant were living together amicably several days a week even though their marriage had effectively come to an end. The living arrangements were principally so that the appellant could care for their children when their mother was absent on business. The complainant and the appellant had separate bedrooms. Shortly before the incident giving rise to the offences there had been some discussion between them about a reconciliation but the complainant was not prepared to change the then existing arrangements. 
     
      
    6 On 19 November 2004 at about 5.30pm the complainant returned home from a trip to the Gold Coast. The appellant indicated that he was going out for the evening. The complainant understood that he was not returning that night. At about 5am the next morning the complainant was awoken by the presence of the appellant, naked, in her bedroom. He said that he wanted to make love to her but she told him not to be silly, that he was drunk and that he should go back to bed. He left the room and she locked the door behind him. About 40 minutes later he knocked at the door saying that he wanted to speak to her. The complainant opened the door slightly in order to silence him but he forced his way into the room. He was naked except for a pair of the complainant’s lace panties. The complainant asked him why he was wearing her underwear and he replied, “Because I’m a sick fuck”. 
     
      
    7 The appellant said to the complainant, “I’m going to have sex with you one last time and then I’m going to kill myself and you’ll never have to see me again”. She told him not to be silly but he struck her to the jaw causing her to fall onto the bed. The appellant then climbed on to the bed, pinned her down and hit her a number of times about the head. She attempted to get up but the appellant grabbed her by the hair, repeating that he was going to have sex with her and then kill himself. He told her that she could “do it the easy way or the hard way” to which the complainant responded that she would do it the easy way. 
     
      
    8 The complainant then removed the boxer shorts she was wearing and lay on the bed. The appellant had intercourse with her. He then lifted her t-shirt and touched her breasts saying that he was a “sick fuck”. This allegation gave rise to the first offence on the indictment. 
     
      
    9 Their daughter came to the door calling for the complainant. She asked the appellant to go and calm the child. He got up and put on a bathrobe telling the complainant to stay where she was or he would kill her. While he was out of the room, the complainant sent a text message to two of her friends asking them to call the police. This was at about 5.50am. The appellant returned to the room and again grabbed the complainant by the hair asking “the easy way or the hard way?” The complainant was forced to lie on her stomach and the appellant again had intercourse with her. This allegation was the basis of the second count on the indictment. 
     
      
    10 According to the complainant the appellant then “grabbed my arms and he tried to pin them behind my back”. She asked him what he was doing and he said, “I’m going to fuck you up the arse”. The appellant then inserted his penis in the complainant’s anus. This allegation gave rise to the third count on the indictment. 
     
      
    11 The daughter again came to the door calling for the complainant and the appellant allowed her to leave the room. She put on a t-shirt and wrapped a towel around her waist. She took with her a mobile phone and, when outside the bedroom, dialled triple O. She told the operator that her husband was hurting her and gave the address. She then saw the appellant outside the child’s room banging his head against the wall. He told her to go downstairs which she did. She tried to leave by the front door but it was locked. The appellant caught her and threatened that he would kill her if she did not do what he wanted. He attempted to drag her into the garage during which her shirt was ripped. She went upstairs to see to their children, who were distressed, and the appellant, who had followed her, said to their son, “Mummy’s going to take care of you now because I can’t”. 
     
      
    12 The complainant took the opportunity while the appellant was speaking to the children to escape the house but the appellant chased and caught her. He commenced punching her to the head and body. A neighbour came out onto the street and the appellant fled back into the house. He grabbed a rope and ran into a nearby park where he attempted to hang himself. He climbed into a tree, secured the rope to a branch, placed it around his neck and jumped. However, two men, who were in the park at the time, saw what happened and supported the appellant’s weight, relieving the pressure around his neck, until police arrived and cut him down. 
     
      
    13 Police spoke to the complainant outside her home. She said, “He came into my room and wanted sex. I managed to get him out. He came back in. He grabbed me and hit me. He said I could do it the hard way or the easy way. He told me he wanted to fuck me one more time before he killed himself”. 
     
      
    14 The complainant later found a text message on her mobile phone from the appellant sent at 4.15am as follows, “Do u want to make love 2 night?” Late that day the complainant located a suicide note written by the appellant. 
     
      
       
        
        The defence case 
        
       
      
    15 The appellant gave evidence that he had been out drinking that night until about 4.30am. After he arrived home, he had been thinking of killing himself because he was sick of his life. He was unhappy that he had no place of his own so that his children could stay with him and his work was not enjoyable. He said that he went to the complainant’s room and spoke to her about his depression. She told him that he was “talking crap”, whereupon he commenced hitting her. When his daughter came to the door, he took her back to bed. He realised what he had done and returned to apologise to the complainant for hitting her. However she said, “Yeah, you are a big fucking man aren’t you?” He thereupon lost his temper and commenced striking her again. 
     
      
    16 The daughter returned to the bedroom and ran to the complainant. Seeing this, the appellant sat on the floor and commenced to cry. The complainant took the child back to bed. He decided to kill himself and left the room. He obtained a rope and went to the kitchen where he wrote a note for his mother. The complainant left the house and ran into the street where he again assaulted her until interrupted by the appearance of a neighbour. He then went to the park where he attempted to hang himself. 
     
      
       
        
        The medical evidence 
        
       
      
    17 Dr Svoboda saw the complainant at about 8.30am the morning of the incident. She gave evidence of a history she took from the complainant that was not significantly different from the account given by the complainant in evidence. In that account the complainant said that the appellant “forcibly held her hands behind her back”. During the course of her account of the injuries suffered by the complainant the doctor noted, “There was tenderness to palpation of both wrists. No associated bruising was noticed”. Neither counsel asked any question about these particular injuries nor what might have caused them. 
     
      
    18 The following evidence in chief was given by the doctor in relation to whether the examination of the complainant supported the allegation of sexual assaults: 
     
      
       
        
         
        A. ………….. The normal anogenital examination and speculum examination neither confirmed nor refute(d) the allegation of sexual assault. 
         
         
        Q. In other words, the finding in relation to that part of your examination is neutral? 
         
        A. Yes. It's not possible to say whether, from the examination whether sexual assault did occur, however, the majority of sexual assaults there is no injury to the anogenital region. 
         
         
        Q. Why is that? 
         
        A. There are many reasons why that may be possible. It's a combination of reasons from both the victim and the assailant. Victim reasons would be due to what we call the physiological state of the tissues. So a woman who is of a reproductive age who has oestrogen has very flexible healthy tissues which are very resistant to tearing and to injury. Also prior sexual experience means that a woman can alter her body to prevent injury, particularly if there is pain, she may be able to tilt her pelvis to prevent an injury occurring to her genital region. And also lack of resistance so where there has been threat of harm a woman may become quite passive and not resist entry into her vagina or anus and therefore is less likely to be injured. The other factor is the use of force so that if (sic) an assailant factor how much force there is in penetration and during penetration will also impact on the amount of injury if any is seen. 
         
         
        Q. Thank you. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Assuming that he had had a considerable amount of alcohol to drink and having regard to the fact that the complainant told you that she couldn't say whether (he) ejaculated or not, are those factors likely to affect whether or not there would be injury to her private parts? 
         
        A. Alcohol would have an inhibitory affect on his ability to maintain an erection and to ejaculate so it may have an impact and also with his lack of coordination if he was intoxicated may also have limited the amount of force that could be used. 
         
        
       
      
    19 During the course of the addresses both counsel referred to this evidence. The Crown reminded the jury that the evidence was neutral and referred to the doctor’s explanation for why this was not uncommon. Defence counsel stressed what she said was the significance of the finding that the anogenital and the speculum examination were normal and the lack of any finding of semen on samples taken from the complainant. Defence counsel submitted that, in light of the absence of any bruising to the genitals or the anus and the absence of any semen, the jury would have a reasonable doubt that intercourse took place. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
      
    20 Against this background the complaint raised in the first ground of appeal is that the judge misdirected the jury in relation to the evidence of the doctor so that in effect what was neutral evidence came to bolster the credibility of the complainant. 
     
      
    21 During the course of the summing up and in the absence of the jury the following occurred: 
     
      
       
        
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: There's just one further area in relation to my friend's submissions on the medical evidence and that was in relation to the neutral finding of the doctor in relation to her examination of the complainant's genitalia and anus. It wasn't - in my submission, the inference - my friend can't draw from a neutral finding the - something which she has referred to as being very significant. That is there being no bruising to either the anus or the vagina. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, I will be saying something about that too. 
         
         
        WARWICK: Your Honour, the doctor did say the examination was normal. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes but she went on to say that normal is the normal. Normal is the norm. That quite frequently one does not find damage to the genital area. One does find it where there's particularly vigorous penetration. One doesn't find it so much in a woman - this woman had had three children. This accused had had a skinful of alcohol. There's serious doubt as to whether he ejaculated. That's the jury might think not the kind of penetration that would cause any damage, any physical damage. And that's a point that the doctor made in her evidence. 
         
         
        WARWICK: Your Honour in general about - she did say in general that those factors can be relevant. She also said she didn't have any evidence of those factors in this case. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: There was no evidence of vigorous thrusting of the penis. So that's consistent with the possibility that you wouldn't find any damage. 
         
         
        WARWICK: Your Honour she also said that there was – that she didn't know whether there was any previous anal intercourse and that she thought that could affect that and she said whether there was lubrication could affect that as well. Which might be relevant in this particular case. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: At the end of the day, the doctor is neutral on that. She says that the findings don't point either to guilt or to innocence and that - the jury could take that on board, but that's not then to be the basis of a submission that there must be a reasonable doubt on that alone. I will consider very carefully over night what directions I will give the jury. 
         
        
       
      
    22 The next day, during the course of his summing up, the Judge said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        There is another matter I want to mention. The doctor told you that there was no sign of injury to the vaginal area or to the anus of this woman. And the doctor has suggested to you that that finding is neutral. It does not support the proposition that there was a sexual assault. But it does not negate the proposition. When you are looking at that, you might bear in mind that the complainant says that faced with what she was faced with, she became compliant. And of course you remember I told you yesterday that there is no obligation in law for a woman to fight off an assailant. If she submits through fear or terror, that does not mean she is consenting. But if you accept that she did not reject him, physically, then that might throw some light on your thinking as to the absence of injuries. 
         
         
        It was put to you that there was no semen found in relation to this matter. That is something that you would have to consider. But bear in mind that the complainant told you that he did not ejaculate. And bear in mind that this is a man who had been out on the beer all night. He had left after dinner and arrived back at 5 o'clock in the morning. He had consumed a slab of beer. And this is a classic instance of a jury being called upon to use their own common sense and experience of the world. 
         
        
       
      
    23 It was submitted that this passage had the effect of allowing the doctor’s evidence to bolster the credibility of the complainant by suggesting that the medical evidence was consistent with the complainant becoming compliant to the appellant’s demands. It was also complained that the Judge did not indicate that the evidence was consistent with the appellant’s account. It was further submitted that the evidence of the doctor’s examination of the complainant’s genital and anal area should not have been tendered in evidence. 
     
      
    24 In my opinion these complaints have no merit and the last submission has an air of unreality about it. True it is that there are decisions of this Court that favour alternate arrangements being made that would make it unnecessary for the Crown to call “neutral” medical evidence; see R v Dann (NSWCCA, unreported, 19 May 2000) and R v RTB [2002] NSWCCA 104. But in a case, such as the present, where the doctor is being called to give evidence of a general examination of the complainant shortly after the alleged assaults including findings as to all the physical injuries suffered by the complainant, it seems to me to be unrealistic for there to be no evidence given as to the result of her examination of the complainant’s genitalia or anus in light of the complaint made to her. The jury would expect such an examination to have taken place and would want to know the results of it. Provided that the evidence was given in a way that did not suggest that the findings were consistent with the complainant’s version, it seems to me to be only sensible for the jury to be informed of all the findings made by the doctor from her clinical examination of the complainant. That is what occurred in the present case. 
     
      
    25 And it also seems to me to be relevant for the doctor to explain why the findings of a lack of any injury to the complainant’s genitalia or anus were neutral. That is a matter of medical expertise and I would not expect a jury to have appreciated from common experience how there could be an allegation of forced sexual intercourse yet no injury consistent with that allegation apparent a short time after the event. No objection was taken to this evidence and in my view there was no reason for it to be rejected. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion the Judge did no more in the passage quoted above than was necessary to address the submission of defence counsel to the jury that the absence of injuries to the complainant’s genital area or anus was a “significant” matter. Because the absence of injury was neutral, it had no significance one way or the other. It would have been obvious to the jury how such a finding was consistent with the appellant’s account without the Judge commenting on that fact. Yet the Judge was entitled to explain to the jury how the absence of any injury was not necessarily inconsistent with the complainant’s account. The Judge made it clear that the evidence neither supported the Crown’s case nor negated it. What was said could not in my opinion lead the jury to view the medical evidence as assisting the Crown case. 
     
      
    27 This ground of appeal does not succeed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
      
    28 This ground also arises from what the Judge said to the jury about the doctor’s evidence. It has already been noted that the doctor referred to finding “tenderness to palpation of both wrists” and that “no associated bruising was noted”. The doctor also found “a faint blue bruise with marked tenderness and swelling” on the right first web space. She gave evidence that this injury could have been due to a direct blow or a forceful gripping of the hand. The doctor expressed no opinion as to the cause of the injury to the wrists nor was she asked to explain what was meant by “tenderness to palpation”. 
     
      
    29 The Crown in address stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        You've heard the doctor's report in relation to the injuries sustained by [the complainant]. Pardon me for a moment. And it might have appeared to you it was almost like a shopping list of injuries, injuries to the facial area, to the jaw, to the neck area thereabouts and tellingly and I'll get back to this a bit later, the swelling of the wrists. You recall that whilst the accused agreed that he beat her about the head with fist and open hand, (he) denied pinning her wrists down. You'll recall the complainant told you in relation to the allegations of - the second and third allegations on the indictment that then he came back into the room you remember those words, it can be easy or it can be hard, words to that effect and according to Michelle pinned her arms ..(not transcribable).. while she was laying flat on the bed. 
         
         
        The accused says nothing of that sort happened. Well you'll remember what the doctor said in relation to those wrists. There was tenderness to palpitation (sic) of both wrists and you might think well that's certainly in accordance with what [the complainant] has told you. 
         
        
       
      
    30 Defence counsel said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Ladies and gentlemen you heard the evidence yesterday of the doctor and the doctor's observations. I would just like to read to you what the doctor said about the complainant's wrists and you will remember, and you will notice from this that this is not what the doctor saw, it's what the complainant told her. The doctor has noted: 
         
         
        ""There was tenderness to palpation of both wrists. No associated bruising was noted."" 
         
         
        Now ladies and gentlemen I put that to you that there is no mention there of visibly seeing either bruising or swelling. What the doctor has recorded is that the complainant said her wrists were tender. 
         
        
       
      
    31 During the course of the summing up and in the absence of the jury, the Judge said to defence counsel: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I propose to tell you that I'm going to direct the jury that your submission about some of the medical evidence was not available to you to make. The doctor included in her findings, ""there was tenderness to palpation of both wrists"". Now that is not something that the complainant told the doctor. That's a clinical finding by the doctor herself on palpating or touching the wrists. You put it that this was something that the complainant had told the doctor, and that's just not - that's a submission that's not available to you. 
        
       
       
      Defence counsel, who admitted that she had misunderstood the evidence of the doctor, raised no objection to such a direction. 
       
      
    32 During the course of reviewing the findings made by the doctor on her examination of the complainant the Judge said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Now I skipped over the sixth one because it reads: 
         
         
        ""There was tenderness to palpation of both wrists. No associated bruising was noted."" 
         
         
        Now I have to say that a submission made to you by Ms Warwick yesterday about that, was not a valid submission. Ms Warwick put it to you that this was something the complainant told the Doctor. Now I will be later referring to the things that the complainant told the Doctor. There is a separate part of the report. These seven matters that I have read out to you are not what the complainant told the Doctor. These are the signs that the Doctor saw in the course of her own clinical examination. And the sixth one is tenderness to palpation of both wrists. 
         
         
        Now the other, one to five and seven, are all consistent with the Accused's case. Because his case is that he gave her several hidings, but did not have sex with her. So that those six findings by the Doctor do not advance the Crown case, by way of corroboration. But the sixth one, tenderness to palpation of both wrists, you could regard that as evidence supporting the complainant's evidence that her hands were pinned behind her back while she was face down on the bed. 
         
        
       
      
    33 The complaint now made is that there was no evidence as to the meaning of the term “tenderness to palpation” nor as to how the doctor had made that finding. It is submitted that no criticism should have been made of the defence submission that it was what the complainant told the doctor as opposed to something objectively observed by the doctor during her examination. 
     
      
    34 It would have been obvious to the jury that the finding that there was tenderness to palpation in the wrists was a finding made by the doctor during her examination. This was one of a number of findings that she had reported including other observable injuries such as bruises and scratches. If the jury had any difficulty with the term or what it meant or conveyed, they could have sought clarification and it should not be assumed that they, unlike both counsel, did not understand the term. But neither party asked the doctor how she derived that finding, and, therefore, it was not open to defence counsel to assume that it was as a result of what the complainant told the doctor. It may have been that the complainant expressed pain when the doctor palpated her wrists, on the other hand she could have shown the feeling of pain by an involuntary reaction to the palpation of the wrists. It was never suggested to the doctor that this was not a reliable or objectively based finding made during the course of her clinical examination and defence counsel was not entitled to suggest otherwise. 
     
      
    35 There was nothing inaccurate or erroneous in what the Judge told the jury and his Honour was entitled, if not required, to point out to them that it was a clinical finding made on examination by the doctor rather than part of the complainant’s account to the doctor of what happened and the injuries that she suffered. Even though the doctor was not asked, and therefore gave no opinion, as to how that injury might have been suffered, the jury were entitled from their own common sense and experience to find that tenderness to touching in the wrists without any observable bruising was at least consistent with the complainant’s account of being pinned by the wrists, an act that the appellant denied. 
     
      
    36 This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
      
    37 This ground complains that the Judge was in error in telling the jury that the injury to the wrist supported the complainant’s account and that this error together with an “inadequate Murray direction” resulted in “unfair prejudice”. 
     
      
    38 It is clear that there was an issue between the parties at trial as to whether the appellant had pinned, or tried to pin, the complainant’s arms behind her back just before the incident giving rise to the third charge occurred. The evidence as it stood before the jury was that the complainant alleged that the appellant held her hands behind her back “very firmly”. The appellant in cross-examination denied that he had pinned her arms or hands behind her back. The jury asked for the cross-examination on this topic to be repeated to them after their retirement. 
     
      
    39 In my opinion it was open to the jury to consider that the tenderness to the wrists supported the complainant on this aspect of their conflicting accounts and, further, that it supported her allegation that she had been sexually assaulted while laying on her stomach. It might have been the case that this injury could have been explained in some other way but this was never explored with the doctor or the complainant. But even had another explanation been available, it would not necessarily follow that the evidence would have been deprived of its corroborative value. It would have been open to the jury to determine whether the injury was more consistent with the complainant’s account than that of the appellant. This is why this injury assumed more significance than the other injuries suffered by the complainant, because they were as equally consistent with the appellant’s account as with that of the complainant. They were “intractably neutral”. The Judge directed the jury to this effect. 
     
      
    40 In any event there was other evidence capable of supporting the complainant’s account. The text message was highly persuasive of her allegations of sexual assault in that it showed that the appellant wanted to have sexual intercourse with her on that evening a short time before the assaults took place. It was cogent evidence supporting her allegations that sexual intercourse occurred. The jury were directed that this was evidence that could corroborate the complainant.  
     
      
    41 Although it is unnecessary to consider the proviso in respect of this aspect of the ground of appeal because I do not consider that there was any error, it should be noted that the complaints made both to police and to the doctor could, and should in my opinion, have been admitted as evidence of the truth of the assertions contained in them. Therefore, they should also have been available to the jury as evidence supportive of the account given by the complainant in the witness box. For reasons that I do not fully understand the Judge directed the jury that they could not use these statements as evidence of the truth of the assertions contained in them. Yet they were made very shortly after the incidents to which they related: the complaint was made to police immediately after the cessation of the assaults upon her and the account to the doctor some three hours later. It seems that part of the reasoning for not admitting the complaints made to the police as evidence of their truth was that they were not written down by the police at the time. That fact may affect the probity of the evidence but I have difficulty seeing how it can impact upon the admissibility of the statements as evidence of the truth of the assertions the police said were made to them by the complainant. There was in my view no good reason to limit the use of the evidence under s 136 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion there was no miscarriage of justice arising from what the Judge said to the jury about the use they could make of the evidence of the doctor as to the injury to the complainant’s wrists. In any event there was ample evidence to support the complainant’s account and the Crown case was, in my view, overwhelming. 
     
      
    43 Associated with this ground of appeal is a complaint that the Judge failed to give an adequate “Murray direction”. This is a direction given where the Crown case is substantially comprised of the evidence of a single witness unsupported by any other evidence. The direction stresses that, before the jury could convict upon the evidence of that witness, they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the witness is reliable. The direction requires the jury to scrutinise the evidence with care before convicting upon it: R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12. 
     
      
    44 During the summing up and in the absence of the jury there was some discussion about whether the judge should give such a direction and his Honour indicated that he would. The Judge accordingly said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I want to talk to you about the question of corroboration. Some Crown cases depend entirely upon the evidence of the complainant. Others do not. In that second category there is sometimes evidence supporting what the complainant says. Where there is no corroboration, it is usual to tell the jury that they should look with great care at the evidence of the complainant, and scrutinise that evidence before accepting it. And Judges give that warning to jurors in every case. 
         
         
        It is not necessarily the case here that there is no corroboration. That is a matter for you to decide, because there are elements of the evidence, which if you accept them, are capable of amounting to corroboration. 
         
         
        The law used to be that a Crown case had to be supported by some corroborative evidence. That is no longer the law. But the elements of the evidence to which I refer, as amounting to corroboration, if you accept them, are principally the incoming text message, and the Doctor’s evidence, or part of the Doctor’s evidence. 
         
         
        
       
      The Judge then went on to explain to the jury the relevance of the text message and the medical evidence, particularly the injuries to the wrist, as discussed above. 
       
      
    45 In support of this ground of appeal it is argued that the direction was inadequate in that the jury ought to have been told that, if they were not satisfied that there was any evidence to support or corroborate the complainant, they should scrutinise her evidence with great care before accepting it. Further, it was submitted that there was no evidence that could amount to corroboration. 
     
      
    46 The direction, with respect, was hardly a model of clarity and it was not entirely accurate. It did not, for example, fully explain the concept of corroboration as evidence that was independent of the complainant and indicated that the accused committed the offence charged; in this case that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant. Yet the Judge did indicate to the jury that there were only two pieces of evidence that could amount to corroboration, being the text message and the injury to the wrists. The jury were also informed that whether or not this evidence did support the complainant was a matter for them. The direction further told the jury that, where there was no evidence supporting a complainant, then it was usual for the judge to warn the jury to “look at the evidence with great care and to scrutinise it”. I confess that I do not understand the difference between scrutinising something and looking at it with great care but the jury would have appreciated the caution with which they were to approach the evidence if they found there was no evidence to support it. 
     
      
    47 In my opinion the direction achieved what was necessary in informing the jury of the manner in which they were to deal with the evidence of the complainant depending upon whether or not they found that her evidence was supported by the text message or the injury to the wrists. The evidence of the text message was clearly supportive of the complainant’s account that the appellant had sexual intercourse with her and it is difficult to see how the jury could have found otherwise. As I have already indicated, I am of the view that the injury to the wrist was capable of supporting the complainant’s account that sexual intercourse took place. 
     
      
    48 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 4 
        
       
      
    49 This ground complains that the summing up was unbalanced because the defence case was not put to the jury. There was no such complaint made to the judge and so rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. 
     
      
    50 The complaint is in effect that only twice during the summing up did the judge note to the jury the nature of the defence case: that no sexual intercourse took place. It was conceded in written submissions on behalf of the appellant that the trial was short and the issues were straightforward. However, it was submitted that this fact did not relieve the trial judge of the obligation to sum up the respective cases of the parties. In this regard the decision of R v RNS [1999] NSWCCA 122 is relied upon. There Bell J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [57] The trial Judge took the course of not summarising any of the evidence in the course of his charge to the jury. Nor did he summarise the submissions made on behalf of the Crown or the appellant or relate the directions of law which he gave to the issues raised by the evidence. 
         
         
        [58] The trial was a short one. Evidence was taken over three days. At the conclusion of the evidence his Honour invited the jury to give careful attention to the addresses of counsel. He had earlier signalled his intention to both counsel not to summarise the evidence. This course was consented to by both counsel. Provision is made in s405AA Crimes Act for a trial Judge to dispense with a summary of the evidence. That provision does not permit the trial Judge to give the jury no guidance as to the way the evidence relates to the directions of law given. It does not relieve the trial Judge of the obligation to sum up the respective cases made by the Crown and the accused; Regina v Condon (1995) 83 A Crim R 335 at 347; Regina v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91. 
        
       
      
    51 The summing up in the present case was a relatively short one, extending to about 31 double-spaced pages of typed transcript. However, in the present case, unlike the situation in RNS, there is no suggestion that the trial judge failed during the summing up to explain how the evidence related to the directions of law that he gave to the jury. Nor as in RNS was there any error or deficiency in the directions or warnings given to the jury to the disadvantage of the appellant. 
     
      
    52 From my reading of the summing up, it does not appear to be unfairly unbalanced in favour of the Crown, a view apparently consistent with that held by defence counsel at the trial who made no complaint. For example, there is little or no comment upon the evidence or the differing accounts given by the Crown and the defence. In fact there is very little review of the evidence, a matter that the Judge acknowledged to the jury. The only matters dealt with in any detail were the text message and the injuries to the wrists because of their potential value as corroboration. The Judge made little reference to the defence address, except to correct what was said about the injury to the wrists as discussed above. However, he made no reference to the Crown’s address except in a general way to explain the Crown case to the jury on each of the charges. 
     
      
    53 Therefore, the ground of appeal needs to be considered only as to the alleged failure of the Judge to review in any detail the defence case. Although there is an obligation in a summing up for a judge to bring home to the jury the ambit of the defence case, it does not mean that in every case the Judge is to review the evidence given by an accused even where the extent of the defence is simply a denial of the substance of the charge. In R v Piazza (1997) 94 A Crim R 459 Grove J referred to the obligations of a judge in a summing up notwithstanding the terms of what was then s 405AA of the Crimes Act 1900, a provision now found in s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1987. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Subs(3) preserves other obligations of the Judge and the provision does not detract from the duty to communicate to the jury of what the respective cases being presented on behalf of the Crown and accused consist, and how it is that cases are claimed to be supported (or not) by the evidence. The Judge is not required to restate every argument put on behalf of an accused but he must ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence: Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555. 
        
       
      
    54 Hunt CJ at CL stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I wish to add to what Grove J has said concerning s405AA of the Crimes Act 1900. The section was inserted in the Crimes Act late in 1990, by Act 74 of that year, following repeated criticisms by this court of trial Judges who apparently believed that they were obliged to read out to the jury the evidence which had been given chronologically, starting with the first witness and going through the evidence in chief, the cross examination and then the re examination of each witness before turning to the next witness and so on, and who also apparently believed that by doing so they had presented to the jury the issues of fact which they had to determine. 
         
         
        Subs(1) of s405AA relieved trial Judges of any such perceived obligation to summarise all of the evidence. In truth, there never was such an obligation. The obligation has always been, and remains, that to which I have already referred, to present to the jury the issues of fact which they have to determine, and to do so with such reference to the facts of the case as is necessary to assist them in that task. In Regina v Zorad, decided earlier in 1990, this court said: 'A summing up should, in every case, not only include directions as to the ingredients of the offence which the Crown has to establish and an explanation of how the relevant law maybe applied to the facts of the particular case, but it should also include a collected resume of the evidence which relates to each of those ingredients and a brief outline of the argument which have been put in relation to that evidence 
        
       
      
    55 Grove J quoted those passages in R v Townsend [1999] NSWCCA 294 at [16] – [17] in determining to uphold a ground of appeal that asserted that the summing up failed to put adequately or fairly the defence case. Although in that case the appellant had given evidence at trial denying the allegations of sexual assault made against him by a niece, the defence had also called a number of witnesses to give evidence tending to show that the complainant’s evidence could not be true in particular aspects. Notwithstanding that the defence case was described as “patently clear and very simple”, it was held that the trial miscarried because the trial judge did not attempt to summarise to the jury the case as presented by the prosecution or the defence and, therefore, failed to fulfil a fundamental obligation in summing up to the jury. 
     
      
    56 In the present case the trial was a very short one and the simple issue was whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant as she alleged. Apart from those allegations there was little of the evidence in dispute. The jury were empanelled on 16 May 2005. The appellant commenced to give evidence shortly before lunch on 18 May. His evidence was substantially completed that afternoon but he gave a further hour of evidence the next day. That evidence commenced at about 12 pm after a morning of legal argument. The evidence concluded at about 1pm on 19 May. Counsel addressed the jury after lunch and the Judge commenced summing up immediately that afternoon. Defence counsel’s address was very brief and largely taken up by summarising the appellant’s evidence and relying upon the medical evidence. The summing up was completed the next morning and the jury retired at 11 am. There are references in the summing up to the accused’s case being that there was no sexual intercourse even though he admitted to having physically assaulted the complainant on the morning in question. 
     
      
    57 I cannot accept that in the circumstances of this particular case, the failure of the judge to summarise the appellant’s evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice or in a summing up that was so defective that the convictions following it cannot be allowed to stand. As I have already indicated, the Crown case was in my view overwhelming. That fact of course does not alone justify a failure of the Judge to put the defence case adequately or fairly to the jury and it might in some cases require that the Judge be careful to ensure that the defence case is not lost or overwhelmed by references in the summing up to the Crown case. But here, unlike the situation in Townsend, there was little evidence other than that given by the appellant himself that supported the defence case. 
     
      
    58 I simply cannot believe that we have reached the stage of formalism in respect of a summing up where a failure to summarise the appellant’s evidence alone must, in the absence of any other error or inadequacy on the part the trial judge, inevitably result in a mistrial. This is particularly so where there was no complaint by defence counsel who must have been satisfied that in all the circumstances the summing up was fair to her client and that the jury would have appreciated his defence. 
     
      
    59 I am of the opinion that this ground fails. 
     
      
    60 Although Ground 5 relies upon what is said to be the accumulation of errors raised in the earlier grounds, I do not consider there were any errors which taken either individually or together resulted in a miscarriage of justice. In my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
        
        Sentence 
        
       
      
    61 The Judge sentenced the appellant on the first count to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 10 years to commence from 29 November 2004 and to expire on 28 November 2014 with a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months. On the second and third counts the Judge imposed identical terms of imprisonment each made up of a non-parole period of 7 years from 29 November 2004 and to expire on 28 November 2011 with a balance of term of 2 years and 4 months. Thus all of the sentences were to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    62 The maximum penalty for the offence in the first count was imprisonment for 20 years and there is an applicable standard non-parole period of 10 years. In respect of the offences on the second and third counts the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 
     
      
    63 The appellant was born on 25 April 1968. He has a minor record for dishonesty in New South Wales and in 1990 was sentenced in the ACT Supreme Court for a sexual assault offence to imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months to be released after 6 months on a recognisance with supervision and 30 hours at an attendance centre. 
     
      
    64 A pre-sentence report indicated that the appellant had responded well to supervision that was terminated early in August 1992. He reported a stable and supportive upbringing by his mother and grandparents. He had maintained various employments with public service departments until his arrest. The appellant admitted to drinking heavily on the weekends and using cannabis at the time of the offences. He stated that he was feeling suicidal on the morning when the incident took place. He denied any physical abuse of the complainant during their relationship and continued to deny having sexually assaulted her. However, he had agreed to be assessed for a sexual offender’s programme in gaol. 
     
      
    65 The Judge found that there was no evidence of contrition and that “the prospect of rehabilitation is by no means positive”. He accepted the following passage from the pre-sentence report: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Taking into account all of the above information and incorporating a standardised risk/needs assessment process the offender is suitable for a high level of intervention by this Service commensurate with assessed risk. The individualised case plan would include strategies to address the following identified areas of criminogenic need. One, alcohol and other drug abuse. Two, anger management. Three, sexual offending however [the appellant] would appear to require the high intensity custody based intensive treatment program in order to adequately address his offending behaviour. 
         
        
       
      
    66 The Judge found the offences were not planned and that there was no serious physical injury inflicted upon the complainant. However, his Honour described them as “terrible crimes” and assessed them as falling into the mid-range of seriousness. The Judge found that there were no special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and stated “I see no call for accumulation of the sentences I propose”. 
     
      
    67 There was initially only one ground of appeal argued in written submissions being that the Judge erred in the treating the appellant’s prior conviction as an aggravating factor. The complaint arises from the following passage in the remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I am mindful of the provisions of s 21A and have taken them into account. In particular I regard his previous record as an aggravating factor. Further, the offences involved a breach of trust as the offender being the estranged husband of the complainant was provided by her with a key to the house so that he could be available to [care for] the children. 
         
        
       
      
    68 This is yet another case where a sentencing judge has simply referred to a matter in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act without any explanation as to why in the case before the court the factor of aggravation applied. The sentencing remarks were given on 28 July 2005. By that time it was established that s 21A(2)(d) should be limited by common law principles so that a prior criminal record was an aggravating factor only in the sense that it indicated there was a need for increased retribution, deterrence or the protection of the community: R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 76; R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193. Although a question arose in this Court as to whether the provision was so limited, authority binding upon the Judge constrained the use to be made of that factor in a way that meant it had no applicability to the case before him. A sexual assault offence committed 14 years earlier may have been relevant to suggest that the offences for which the appellant was to be sentenced were not completely aberrant but it could not in any way aggravate the offence or increase the otherwise appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    69 At the hearing of the appeal an affidavit was tendered on the basis that it would be received as fresh or new evidence. The affidavit was made by the solicitor of the appellant who claimed to have “vast experience in criminal law”. As a result of his reading of the transcripts, the solicitor believed that “psychological issues were relevant to sentencing and an experts (sic) report would have been of assistance to the Court in determining a sentence according to law……”. The affidavit states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        As I believe the appellants (sic) threat and his actual attempt at self harm was not rational behaviour I retained a forensic psychologist, John Jacmon, to consult with the appellant for the purposes of a report. 
         
        
       
       
      A report dated 16 October 2006 by Dr Jacman was attached. The Crown objected to the affidavit and the report being tendered. 
       
      
    70 The present situation with regard to the affidavit and the psychological report is almost identical to that which was before the Court in R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359, NSWCCA, unreported 2 December 1997. In that case, with the concurrence of Hunt CJ at CL and Smart J, I stated at p 28 of the unreported version of the judgment (the judgment as printed in the volume of the Australian Criminal Reports has at least one typographical error); 
     
      
       
        
         
        The appeal against sentence is based principally upon the Court receiving into evidence a report by a psychologist Dr Hayes. That report is dated 6 August 1997 and was based upon an assessment of the appellant the day before the report was prepared. It is obvious that the report was made after the appellant had been sentenced by the trial judge. The report is, therefore, either fresh or new evidence and it is admissible only if proper grounds have been established: R v Lanham [1970] 2 NSWLR 218; R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 257. Absent sentencing error which requires the Court to resentence an appellant, this Court should, in my view, resist attempts to place before it material which was not before the sentencing judge. Simply because the legal representatives of an appellant (very often not the particular solicitor and barrister who acted for the appellant at the hearing on sentence) feel that some aspect of the personal circumstances of the appellant was not properly investigated and, therefore, not placed before the sentencing judge, or because they consider that more attention should have been given to some subjective factor than was paid to it by the legal representatives of the appellant at the sentencing hearing, it should not generally follow that a proper basis has been made out for this Court to receive such material. Those representing an accused person before the trial court have a wide discretion to conduct the defence as they see fit and this Court should not generally interfere in the exercise of that discretion: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683-685. I see no reason why that principle should not apply, at least to the same extent, to sentencing proceedings as it does to the actual trial. 
         
        
       
      
    71 In the present case there was clearly material that indicated that the appellant was in a somewhat abnormal state of mind on the evening in question over and above the fact that he was intoxicated. On the complainant’s account he had told her that he wanted to have intercourse once more before killing himself. He wrote a letter that he left in the kitchen as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Mum Please 4give me. I tryed (sic) to be a good son. Nan, I’m so sorry to put u through this. I have no explination (sic). 
         
        
       
       
      The wife gave evidence that the appellant was at one stage banging his head against the wall of the house and telling the children that he would not be able to look after them any longer. And of course there was the attempt to hang himself in the park. The appellant’s uncontradicted evidence at the trial was that he intended to commit suicide. There was also evidence of him wearing the complainant’s panties and his explanation to her that he was “a sick fuck”. 
       
      
    72 The pre-sentence report contained the following under the heading “Factors related to offending”: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Emotional 
         
        [The appellant] reports that he was feeling suicidal at the time of the offences. He was separated from his wife and children, had no stable accommodation and felt like a failure. 
        
       
       
      Later the report states: 
       
        
         
        Apart from his sexual offending [the appellant] appears to have a lengthy history of depression with thoughts and actions leading to self-harm. He has been referred to a psychologist to address this problem. 
        
       
      
    73 During the course of submissions by defence counsel at the sentencing hearing she relied upon the emotional upheaval of the appellant as evidenced by his attempt to commit suicide. The Judge asked whether there was any evidence of brain injury and defence counsel said that she had instructions that there had been periods of headaches and dizziness but they had passed. The Judge asked whether she was happy to proceed without pursuing that topic and counsel indicated that she was. Further during the course of her address defence counsel referred to the fact that the appellant had been seeing a psychologist while in custody. It seems reasonably clear that, for whatever reason, a decision was made not to place before the court any psychological or psychiatric evidence. 
     
      
    74 I do not find it particularly remarkable that no psychological material was placed before the Judge. As I have already indicated, it was obvious that the appellant was mentally disordered on the evening in question in that he apparently formed the intention to commit suicide before he decided to assault the complainant. It was one of the reasons he gave for wanting to have intercourse with her. There was no suggestion that the attempt to take his life was not a genuine one. There was some material indicating that as a result he was hospitalised for some period of time although no medical evidence was placed before the court. There was material before the Judge that the appellant was depressed at the time because of his situation with the children and his lack of any permanent accommodation away from the family home. He had given evidence to this effect during the course of the trial and a similar statement was contained in the pre-sentence report. However, although his mental state was a relevant factor, it lost some of its significance because of the prior offence of sexual assault for which he had been imprisoned. 
     
      
    75 Even without a psychological report, it would have been reasonable for the Judge to infer that the appellant’s mental condition was a somewhat transient state due to his particular circumstances at the time, and that his intoxication contributed to his feelings of despair on this evening. The pre-sentence report indicated how the appellant needed assistance and what could be done to advance his rehabilitation. Although there may have been a particular course of psychological treatment required, there was ample material before the Judge upon which a finding of special circumstances could have been made to assist the rehabilitation of the appellant if the Judge had been minded to make such a finding. 
     
      
    76 I am far from satisfied that there is a sufficient foundation made out to receive the psychological report as a basis for interfering with the sentence imposed absent any other error in the exercise of the judge’s discretion. I would reject the evidence as fresh or new evidence going to the merits of the appeal. However, I would be prepared to accept the report, if the Court came to re-sentence the appellant, on the basis that it amplified material that was before the sentencing Judge. However, I wish to make clear my view that this Court should not readily receive evidence when called upon to re-sentence an appellant where that evidence could have, and should have, been placed before the sentencing Judge. It is not appropriate in my view that this Court should rehear the sentencing proceedings afresh. 
     
      
    77 However, notwithstanding the absence of any psychiatric or psychological report, there was, as I have already indicated, clear evidence that the appellant was disordered in his thinking and behaviour on the night in question. Yet there is no reference to this fact by the Judge in his sentencing remarks other than when reciting the facts or in a lengthy quote from the pre-sentence report. The only reference to defence counsel’s submissions in this regard was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Counsel’s reference to emotion and alcohol lacks cogency. 
        
       
      
    78 With respect I do not understand that remark in light of the evidence of the appellant’s unstable mental condition at the time. The appellant’s mental state was clearly a relevant fact in determining whether the offence was in the mid-range of seriousness, yet there is no reference to it at all when the Judge was determining the seriousness of the offences. The Judge gives no reasons for making the finding that the offending fell within the mid-range of seriousness. In obvious cases the failure to do so might not indicate that the discretion miscarried. But where, as here, there was in existence an obvious fact that would tend against such a finding, there seems to me to be a requirement based upon general principles that the Judge explain how the finding was made notwithstanding the evidence of the appellant’s mental state. 
     
      
    79 In my opinion the absence of any appropriate consideration of the appellant’s mental state on any of the issues that the sentencing judge was required to consider indicates that the sentencing discretion miscarried by reason of the failure to take into account a relevant fact. It is, therefore, open to the Court to consider the psychological report on the question of re-sentencing the appellant. 
     
      
    80 The psychological report does not advance the matter greatly. Much of it is simply a restatement of the appellant’s version of events and his feelings at the time of the incident. Unsurprisingly the psychologist reports that the appellant suffered from clinical levels of depression and anxiety at the time of the incident and had suicidal thoughts. These problems led him to abuse alcohol and directly impinged upon his capacity to make reasoned judgments. The psychologist believes that the appellant needs intensive treatment and has set out a treatment plan. 
     
      
    81 None of this material really explains why the appellant embarked upon violence to the complainant including sexually assaulting her, except that his thoughts and judgments were disordered. As I have already noted, the material has less significance than might otherwise have been the case in light of the earlier sexual assault offences. Still it seems to me to be a matter of significance in determining whether the offences were within the mid-range of seriousness and in light of his disordered mental state I do not believe that they are. 
     
      
    82 There are a number of matters that can amount to aggravating factors under s 61J. They are clearly not all of the same seriousness. For example, it is an aggravating factor to threaten to inflict actual bodily harm at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the sexual assault. Generally speaking that factor would be less serious than actually inflicting harm. But of course it depends upon the nature of the threat and, for example, whether a weapon was used. It is an aggravating factor that the victim has a serious physical or serious intellectual disability. Again, generally speaking, such a matter of aggravation would be more serious than inflicting harm that amounted to no more than bare actual bodily injury. Of course there can be other aggravating factors not mentioned in s 61J(2), such as acts degrading the complainant. 
     
      
    83 As I have indicated there is no analysis at all undertaken by the sentencing judge of what an offence of mid-range seriousness would entail in such a situation where there are a range of aggravating factors that may or may not be present and may differ in degrees of seriousness. It is not an easy task to consider what might represent an offence of mid-range seriousness in such a situation but that is what is required. It is not good enough, in my opinion, in such a case simply to make the bald statement that the offence is within the mid-range of seriousness without explaining how that assessment has been made or to describe them as “terrible crimes”. It is unfortunate that sentencing has been so complicated by the standard non-parole provisions but that is a result of the legislation and the courts cannot avoid it. Although an assessment of the seriousness of an offence is a finding of fact and one with which the court will not normally interfere, when the finding is made apparently without any regard to a critical piece of evidence, it cannot withstand scrutiny. 
     
      
    84 In the present case, it is clear that the offences were impulsive and had their genesis in the appellant’s alcohol consumption and his consequential depression and disordered thinking. Of course the offences occurred in the complainant’s own home, but that was of less significance in this case because the appellant was living there. The Judge found that this gave rise to a breach of trust because the appellant had been given a key to the premises to look after the children. With respect that misrepresents the situation and I doubt that this was an aggravating feature within the terms of s 21A(2)(l). There was no other aggravating factor under s 21A(2) nor otherwise. However, there were no mitigating factors under s 21A(3). 
     
      
    85 In my opinion, notwithstanding the gravity of the offence under s 61J, it fell significantly below the mid-range of seriousness. All offences falling within this category of sexual assault will be very serious offences and that is no doubt why there is a maximum penalty prescribed of imprisonment for 20 years. But there has to be a discrimination made between the offence committed and the hypothetical offence in the mid-range of seriousness. In this case the aggravating feature based upon the infliction of actual bodily harm was not of a particularly serious kind as the injuries were relevantly minor and mostly superficial. There were no acts of degradation of the complainant other than the sexual assaults themselves. The appellant was mentally disturbed at the time of the offending and this was a direct cause of the offences as it arose from his relationship with the complainant. 
     
      
    86 Similarly in relation to the second and third counts by reason of the appellant’s mental state the offences fall short of the mid-range of offending. It should be noted than none of the aggravating features surrounding that offending could be taken into account because the offences were not charged under s 61J. So it could not be part of the offending that the complainant was threatened at this time and that actual bodily harm was inflicted upon her, for example by the injury to her wrists. Again the Judge gave no consideration at all to what might be a mid-range offence under s 61I or where these particular offences fell within the range of offending encompassed within that section. The task is not an easy one because it is difficult to consider a range of offending without taking into account matters that would give rise to aggravating factors under the more serious offence under s 61J. However, in this case the offence was impulsive and committed when the appellant was mentally disturbed and contemplating suicide. 
     
      
    87 The Judge stated that general deterrence was a factor. That is no doubt true, as it is in all cases of domestic violence. But with respect it is too simplistic a statement in a case where the offences clearly arise from the very disturbed mental state of the offender who was genuinely suicidal throughout the commission of the offences and generally behaving in a bizarre and abnormal manner, such as wearing his wife’s panties. I believe there was a basis to moderate the significance of general deterrence in such a case. 
     
      
    88 The Judge made all sentences concurrent. There is a failure to indicate why he came to that view other than a remark that he saw “no call for accumulation of the sentence I propose”. With respect that is not an adequate consideration of this important issue. It should be clearly understood that the issue of whether sentences should be made concurrent or cumulative is a matter of discretion but is to be determined according to proper principles. It does not follow, particularly with sexual assault offences, that simply because the offences are part of the one criminal activity the sentences should be served concurrently. In R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272 this Court most recently considered this issue and stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [13] In some cases the fact that a sentence for a particular offence is to be served completely concurrently with another sentence for a different offence will result in a sentence that is erroneously inadequate because it does not reflect the totality of the criminality for which the offender was to be punished for the two acts of offending: see for example R v Brown [1999] NSWCCA 323. This may be so even if the two offences arise from the same precise criminal act, such as the dangerous driving of a motor vehicle on the one occasion: R v Janceski (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 288. The same principle has been applied to sexual assault offences arising from a single incident of sexual assault: R v Gorman (2002) 137 A Crim R 326. Although, it has been held that a determination of the extent, if any, that a sentence is to be served cumulatively with another sentence is an exercise of discretion on which minds might differ, R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66, that discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality. 
         
        
       
      
    89 In my opinion the sentence for the first offence could not encompass the total criminality for all the offending. Each of the sexual assaults was serious. There was a break between the offence in the first count and the offences committed in the second and third counts. The third count involved anal intercourse whereas the first and second counts were offences of vaginal intercourse. 
     
      
    90 The issue arises whether there should be a finding of special circumstances. The Judge simply stated that there were none. That finding might have been appropriate in the absence of any psychological evidence to suggest that the appellant needed any particular form of treatment. Normally this court would not interfere with that finding in the absence of anything to suggest that it was not open. However where, as here, the discretion totally miscarried by the failure of the Judge to properly consider the question of the standard non-parole period, it is open to this Court to reconsider the issue as it is in effect re-exercising the sentencing discretion afresh. The appellant according to the psychological report remains at risk of suicide and will do so until he can resolve to accept the break-up of his family. He needs extensive treatment and no doubt this can best be achieved on his release. However, the offences are such that there can be little moderation to the non-parole period to ensure that it reflects the objective seriousness of the offending notwithstanding the appellant’s mental state at the time. There are special circumstances in respect of the second and third counts because of the partial accumulation of sentences. 
     
      
    91 The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) Appeal against conviction dismissed; 
         
         
        (2) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted, appeal allowed and the sentences quashed; 
         
         
        (3)(a) On the first count the appellant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years to date from 29 November 2004 and to expire on 28 November 2010. There is to be a balance of term of 3½ years from 29 November 2010; 
         
         
        (3)(b) On the second and third counts the appellant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3½ years to date from 29 November 2008 and to expire on 28 May 2012 the date upon which the appellant is eligible to be released to parole. There is to be a balance of term of 3½ years from 29 May 2012. 
        
       
       
      It is intended that the appellant be sentenced to an overall term of 11 years with an overall non-parole period of 7½ years from 29 November 2004 before being eligible to be released to parole on 28 May 2012. 
       
      
    92 HALL J: I agree with Howie J.

      Introduction 
       
      
    3 The applicant pleaded guilty to 11 charges of dishonestly intending to obtain gain from a Commonwealth entity contrary to the Criminal Code Act (Cth) s 135(1). The maximum penalty for each offence is 5 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    4 On 14 July 2005 the applicant was sentenced in respect of each of those offences in the District Court. The aggregate effective sentence imposed was imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months with a non parole period of 2 years and 3 months. 
     
      
    5 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against sentence on the grounds that: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The sentencing Judge erred in setting the non parole period; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    6 The facts of the offences, shortly stated, were that the applicant was an employee of Centrelink whose duties involved processing requests by childcare providers for additional advances of childcare benefits. The applicant was sentenced on each of the 11 charges upon the basis that in each instance the act that comprised the offence was the altering of the nominated bank account details for the payment of additional advances of childcare benefits to the various relevant childcare providers, so that the bank account details were changed from being those of the service provider to the applicant’s own bank account. The offences occurred over the period October 2002 – April 2004. The offences were discovered in April 2004. Further action by the applicant had resulted in 18 payments to those accounts, the amount of the payments totalling $375,895.26. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing Judge’s findings 
       
      
    7 His Honour, as to the objective criminality of the offences, found the offences seemed to have been planned in the sense that a scheme was designed so that the offender’s intention of obtaining a gain from the Commonwealth entity would be difficult to detect. By these offences the offender created the means of accessing $375,000 worth of Commonwealth funds, the offences occurred over an 18 month period, the offences involved a significant breach of trust and were committed primarily for greed. The intention of obtaining a gain was consummated on 18 discrete occasions 
     
      
    8 As to subjective features his Honour found the plaintiff was born in May 1978, was in good health, a single woman with no dependants. The applicant, in her record of interview, had sought to blame her actions on a major gambling habit. His Honour did not accept her gambling problem, if it existed at all, was anything near as major as she claimed as it was clear considerable sums were spent on lifestyle issues. He considered she was motivated in offending by a compulsive spending habit and perhaps to a lesser degree by a gambling problem. What had motivated her compulsive spending or her gambling was a mystery. Her references were all positive and she appeared to have the support of her family and friends according to them. There had been no public expression of remorse. His Honour however was prepared to find some contrition and insight into the offending although it would appear limited by its nature.  
     
      
    9 His Honour considered there were a number of positive rehabilitation indicators in that it was said she had the support of her family, she had a good work history and had been able to find employment post her offending period, there were no prior convictions, she had some insight into her offending and recognised without malice or resentment the need for punishment, she appeared to enjoy good physical health, and there did not appear to be any drug or alcohol issues in need of resolution. His Honour allowed a discount of 25% for the pleas of guilty. 10 These positive indicators were somewhat qualified by other considerations which his Honour noted as: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) her frankness as to her motives for committing these offences, and more particularly her seeking such a large income stream, has been less than complete; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) there appears to me unexplained and perhaps unresolved issues concerning her money spending patterns; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) if it be the fact, her gambling habits, which appear so far as her money spending is concerned, to have a compulsiveness, and 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) lifestyle choices, that are inconsistent with her upbringing (as I have assumed it to be) to an extent where they may be bizarre. 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        What, if any, impact her past spending patterns would have on her rehabilitation is less clear, although it may well be that since August of 2004 when she was charged those spending patterns have been curtailed. If so that would be a positive rehabilitation indicator. All over, I have viewed her rehabilitation prospects as positive. 
        
       
       
      Ground Two – The sentence is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    12 The applicant in her written submissions concluded as to this ground: 
     
      
       
        
        Having regard in each case to the maximum penalty of five years, which when discounted for the plea of guilty was effectively one of three years and nine months, the imposition of an overall sentence of three years and three months for the offences given the applicant’s age, previous good character, admissions and prospects of rehabilitation is manifestly excessive.  
        
       
      
    13 The respondent, in its written submissions, responded: 
     
      
       
        
        For eleven serious offences committed over the course of eighteen months, involving repeated flagrant breaches of trust by a Commonwealth employee, the imposition of a total aggregate head sentence of three years and three months, with a non-parole period of two years and seven [sic, three] months, is an appropriate sentence to arrive at in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. This is particularly so in the present case where no evidence was presented by the Applicant and the subjective features that were able to be determined were neither compelling nor special in any respect. Accordingly, in all of the circumstances the ultimate sentence imposed cannot be said to be manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    14 I accept the Crown’s submission that the total aggregate head sentence was not manifestly excessive. Indeed I regard that sentence as lenient.  
     
      
      Ground One – The sentencing Judge erred in setting the non parole period. 
       
      
    15 His Honour imposed a single non parole period as he was required to do by s 19AB(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The ratio of the non parole period of 2 years 3 months to the aggregate effective sentence of 3 years 3 months was approximately 69%. 
     
      
    16 The applicant submitted the norm for non parole periods in Commonwealth offences was in the range of about 60% - 66 2/3% - R v Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44. She submitted his Honour had erred in not fixing the ratio within that range. She relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Campos (1999) NSWCCA 339 where this Court varied a non parole period of 70% of the head sentence to 60% thereof. That case is however distinguishable from the present. In that case the sentencing Judge had found the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation were higher than average. It was held on appeal that the sentencing Judge clearly intended to set a proportionally lower non-parole period yet he had done the opposite. 
     
      
    17 The range of 60% - 66 2/3% is not immutable. In R v Bernier this Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        … the norm for non parole periods is in the range of about 60% - 66 2/3%. One factor which may be material is the length of the head sentence and its position in the permissible range. Circumstances may exist which make it appropriate to move outside the usual range for a non parole period. The process is not mathematical or rigid, and often requires a finely tuned assessment. 
        
       
      
    18 In R v Stitt (1998) 102 A Crim R 428 at 432 Dunford J (with whom Beazley JA and Wood CJ at CL) agreed said: 
     
      
       
        
        Generally speaking, in relation to federal offences … non parole periods have generally varied between 60 – 75 percent with periods of 75 percent being rare and limited to the more serious cases where the prospects of rehabilitation have not been considered good.  
        
       
      
    19 In R v Lian (1990) 47 A Crim R 444 at 449 this Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        Although the purposes of the head sentence and minimum term (or non parole period) are to some extent different, they are necessarily related. This point was made by the High Court in  
        Power  
        (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In a true sense the non parole period is a minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the sentencing Judge considers the crime committed calls for such detention. 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 More recently in R v Moore (2005) NSWCCA 212 this Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        Whilst due allowance should always be made for the subjective circumstances of an offender, including an offender’s age and health, the ultimate sentence imposed, both as to the non parole period and the head sentence, must not be disproportionate to the objective gravity of the offence. 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour’s conclusion that the applicant’s rehabilitation prospects were positive would, ordinarily, have resulted in the imposition of a non parole period in the range of 60% – 66 2/3% of the aggregate effective sentence.  
     
      
    22 His Honour however selected a non parole period which yielded a ratio to the aggregate effective sentence of approximately 69%. It may be his Honour intended to depart from the normal ratio because he considered the circumstances made it appropriate to do so. However he did not say that that was his intention nor did he give any reasons for so doing. 
     
      
    23 In R v Bugeja [2001] NSWCCA 196 at [43] Adams J said: 
     
      
       
        
        … there should have been some advertence to the extent to which the non parole period conventionally appropriate did not provide adequate and sufficient personal deterrence and did not reflect the other purposes of sentencing law. 
        
       
      
    24 Notwithstanding that the Crown had referred, in its written submissions on sentence, to the principles relevant to fixing the ratio (the applicant was self represented and made no such submissions) his Honour’s failure to refer to the ratio between the non parole period and the aggregate effective sentence in his Remarks on Sentence leads to the inference that he did not turn his mind to that question. 
     
      
    25 In these circumstances I have concluded that error has occurred and that the non parole period should be varied to reflect his Honour’s findings as to the applicant’s rehabilitation prospects and the normal range referred to in R v Bernier.26 The orders which I propose are as follows: 
     
      
    1. Grant leave to appeal. 
     
      
    2. Confirm the sentences save as to the non parole period.  
     
      
    3. Quash the non parole period and substitute for it a non parole period of 2 years to date from 14 July 2005 and expire on 13 July 2007.

    JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: As to the sentencing of Maria Anne Davies.1 The offender is Maria Anne Davies. She was born on 8 August 1960. She was aged forty-four years and five months when she committed the subject offence and she is aged forty-five years and six months now.2 I know that the offender is married, that her husband is serving a sentence of imprisonment for an offence and that she and her husband are the parents of at least one child, Mr Gary Smale.3 However, I do not know anything of the offender’s background and upbringing, or her education and employments, or her state of health.4 I know that the offender does not have an unblemished character. She has a criminal record. It is exhibit R. She has been dealt with for one hundred and fifty-three offences. Of these offences, four, one committed in 1984, one in 1986 and two in 1990, were related to the use of a prohibited drug. None of the four offences related to the use of a prohibited drug was for the supply of it.5 The relevant chronology leading to the offender’s arrest on 27 March 2005 is as follows.6 On 22 October 2003 Ms Christine White, posing as Mrs Karen Pegg, applied to a firm of real estate agents to lease Unit 6, 49-55 Dwyer Street in North Gosford (see exhibit M). Mr Vincent Tan was involved in the issue of the lease over the unit. Ms Lorraine Studeman, the offender’s aunt, occupied the unit as at 8 January 2005.7 On 27 November 2004 Vivien’s Jewellers of Westfield Shopping Centre in Tuggerah issued an invoice for $17 for repair work to a gold chain and a receipt for a lay-by payment of $500 on a gold chain to Marie Smale, the offender’s married name (see exhibit H).8 On 1st December 2004 Vivien’s Jewellers issued a receipt for payment of $17 for the repair to the chain and a receipt for the final payment of the lay-by of $175 for the gold chain to Marie Smale (see exhibit H).9 On 30 December 2004 Bowen’s Pharmacy of Wyoming supplied prescription medicine to the offender (see exhibit O). The box containing this medicine was found in the unit on 8 January 2005.10 On 2 January 2005 the offender was supplied with two doses of methadone, with one to be taken on 3 January 2005 and the other on 4 January 2005. These doses were found in the unit on 8 January 2005.11 On 7 January 2005 Central Coast Leagues Club issued two cheques in favour of the offender, one for $1,500 and the other for $1,400 (see exhibit G).12 At 6pm on 8 January 2005 police, armed with a search warrant, commenced to search the unit. The search concluded at 8.45pm. During the search police found and seized a blue coloured cash tin (see exhibit F).13 At 6.30pm on 8 January 2005 the offender was stopped when leaving the underground car park of the unit block. She was a passenger in a car. She was spoken to and her handbag was searched. She was allowed to leave without being arrested.14 At 9.48pm on 8 January 2005 police opened the cash tin. The opening of the tin was recorded on video-tape (see exhibit D and exhibit E). Police found a number of things inside the tin (see the list of things exhibit L). Among the things found by police was a plastic bag containing 9.4 grams of heroin (exhibit N), $9,870.50 in cash, the documents of Vivien’s Jewellers issued to Marie Smale, and the cheques of Central Coast Leagues Club issued to the offender.15 On 9 January 2005 Ms Valerie Pinkerton rented a room at the Bella Vista Motel in Kariong.16 At 9.25pm on 10 January 2005 the offender attended at Central Coast Leagues Club and requested that replacement cheques for the two issued to her on 7 January 2005 be issued to her.17 At 9.10pm on 11 January 2005 the offender, in the company of Ms Pinkerton, attended at Central Coast Leagues Club to collect the replacement cheques.18 On 12 January 2005 police seized clothing and other property of the offender and $21,554.70 in cash in the room rented by Ms Pinkerton at Bella Vista Motel. Ms Pinkerton denied any knowledge of the cash money.19 On 27 March 2005 police arrested the offender at the home of Ms Studeman in Wyoming. She was taken to Gosford Police Station where she was charged with, inter alia, deemed supply of a prohibited drug namely, heroin, possession of $9,870.50 reasonably suspected of being unlawfully obtained and possession of $21,554.70 reasonably suspected of being unlawfully obtained. She was remanded in custody, bail refused, to appear before a Magistrate in the Local Court at Gosford on 28 March 2005. As it later transpired, she was released from custody, bail having been granted, on 6 May 2005.20 In due course, on 6 October 2005 the offender appeared before a Magistrate in the Local Court at Gosford for a committal hearing related to the charge of supplying heroin. It was to be a paper committal hearing. As expected, as the prosecution case was not denied or tested, she was committed to appear in this Court to stand her trial.21 On 25 September 2006 the offender appeared before me in this Court at Gosford for her trial. On this day I heard submissions of counsel related to the offender’s objection to some evidence that the Crown Prosecutor wished to adduce. 22 Accordingly, on 26 September 2006 the offender’s trial commenced. The jury heard evidence from fourteen witnesses over five days from 26 September 2006 to 3 October 2006, counsels' addresses and my summing-up on one day, 4 October 2006, and the jury returned its verdict of guilty, which was a majority verdict, on 6 October 2006, after two days deliberation. After taking the jury’s verdict, I remanded the offender in custody, bail refused, pending sentencing.23 On 24 January 2007 the offender appeared before me on the sentencing proceedings. I heard submissions as to sentence from counsel, after which I stood over the proceedings until today.24 I am now to impose sentence upon the offender for the offence of which the jury found her to be guilty.25 The offence committed by the offender is one contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of fifteen years or a fine of a maximum of $220,000 or both. It is an offence which cannot be dealt with summarily. It is an offence which does not carry a standard non parole period. It is a serious offence.26 In determining an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender I must recognise the purposes of sentencing stated in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act, and I must take into account such of the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2) of the Act as are present and such of the mitigating factors referred to in subsection (3) of that section as are present and any other relevant factor.27 The offender’s counsel submitted that the only relevant factor to be taken into account is the quantity of the heroin found in the offender’s possession. He submitted that, as the quantity of heroin was only nine point four grams, it was only four point four grams more than the indictable quantity of five grams and only about one twenty-fifth of the commercial quantity of two hundred and fifty grams, so that, if the quantity had been half of what it was, the offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court and that, as the quantity was only one twenty-fifth of the commercial quantity, the offence falls at the bottom of the range of offences dealt with in the District Court. 28 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that, in assessing what the offender was doing, such factors as the quantity of the heroin, the fact that heroin is supplied on the street in 0.1 gram deals, the bulk and street value of the heroin, the cash money found with the heroin and other items found with the heroin are relevant.29 I agree with the Crown Prosecutor. The other indicia of supplying or intending to supply of a prohibited drug are relevant in the determination of an appropriate sentence to impose upon an offender for the offence of deemed or actual supply of heroin.30 The offender’s counsel submitted that, as the offence committed by the offender was the first offence of supplying a prohibited drug, albeit deemed supply of that drug, it was a one-off offence and is not likely to be repeated, notwithstanding her criminal record of one hundred and fifty three offences, of which four were drug related, so that, in her case, personal deterrence is not as important as it might be in another case.31 I do not agree. Although the offender has been found guilty of the offence of deemed supply of a prohibited drug and the penalty to be imposed upon her must be for that offence alone, I doubt, in view of the amount of cash money found in the tin with the heroin, that this offence would have been a one-off offence and I suspect that, if the heroin had not been found, it would have been supplied to users of it in street deals of 0.1 gram. I consider that the offender intended to, as it were, branch out into a new field of criminality, different from the fields in which she has been involved in the past, by supplying heroin to users of it. I consider that personal deterrence is important. The offender must be reminded, loudly and clearly, that repeat offending will not be tolerated.32 Also, I consider that general deterrence is important, not something to be overlooked or undervalued. People whether suppliers of a prohibited drug the first time or suppliers of it over a long time, who supply prohibited drugs to users of them, and it does not matter whether the drug be heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, cannabis or any other prohibited drug, must be deterred, by the sentences imposed upon people for supplying a prohibited drug, from doing so.33 I accept that the offender either intended to become involved or was involved in the business of supplying heroin to users of it. I consider that, from the quantity of heroin that was found in her possession, she was someone intending to be more involved or was more involved than a street dealer.34 As to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act, I consider that the only aggravating factor of those referred to in subsection (2) of the section that is present is that lettered (n) because the offender’s possession of the heroin was deliberate and for the planned supply of it to users of it. As I know nothing about the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation and as I doubt, in view of her criminal record, that she will not re-offend, I consider that none of the mitigating factors of those referred to in subsection (3) of the section is present.35 What, then, is an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for the offence?36 I have determined, balancing the purposes of sentencing, the objective seriousness of the offence, and those subjective features of the offender of which I am aware, that the non-parole period of the sentence should be three years.37 As to special circumstances, I cannot see any circumstance of those to which I have referred already which I consider to be special. Accordingly, the parole period of the sentence will be one year.38 As the offender had been in prison for forty-one days, between her arrest on 27 March 2005 and her release on bail on 6 May 2005, and, as she has been in prison since I revoked bail on 6 October 2006, I will backdate the sentence so that it will commence forty-one days before 6 October 2006, that is, on 27 August 2006.39 Accordingly, Maria Anne Davies for the offence of deemed supply of a prohibited drug, of which the jury found you to be guilty, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for four years. I fix a non parole period of three years to commence on 27 August 2006 and to expire on 26 August 2009, on which date you are to be eligible to be released on parole, and a parole period of one year from 27 August 2009 to 26 August 2010. I order that you be subject to supervision by the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service whilst on parole during the parole period.40 As to the backup charge of possessing a prohibited drug, I dismiss the charge.41 As to the first related charge, that of possession of $9,870.50 reasonably suspected of having been unlawfully obtained, I consider that, notwithstanding that I could make findings on the evidence placed before the jury, it is in the interest of justice that the offender be given the opportunity of explaining her possession of the money in proceedings related only to that money rather than in proceedings related to the possession of heroin. Accordingly, I remit the charge to the Local Court at Gosford on Friday 23 February 2007 for mention to fix a hearing date.42 As to the second related charge, that of possession of $21,554.70 reasonably suspected of having been unlawfully obtained, by consent, I remit the charge to the Local Court at Gosford on Friday 23 February 2007 for mention to fix a hearing date.43 I order that the drug be destroyed.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Steven William Shearer appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty at an early opportunity to an offence of aggravated break enter and steal. The charged circumstance of aggravation relied on by the crown was that the offender was in company with another person, Alexander Parkes. I am to sentence Mr Parkes later next month.2 However, it is to be noted that the crown could also have relied on other circumstances of aggravation. There were people at home at the time of the offence, it being 8 o’clock in the morning, and under s 105A(2A) of the Crimes Act in those circumstances the offender is deemed to have known that there were people home, unless he is able to prove to me that he could not reasonably have believed that there was there was no-one in the premises. The offender has not given any evidence in this matter but relied on written materials. They are not sufficient in my view to overcome the burden which is imposed upon him. 3 Another circumstance of aggravation the crown could have relied on is that the offender was armed with an offensive weapon. It is here that I have to be careful not to double count because as well as sentencing him for the matter on the indictment I am to take into account an offence of avoiding apprehension by use of an offensive weapon under s 33B of the Crimes Act. Thus if I were to regard the fact that the offender was armed as a circumstance of aggravation for the substantive offence, and then take it into account also in the Form 1 matter, there would be double counting. 4 I mention these additional aggravating features to indicate just how serious this offence was. It was not your standard break, enter and steal, by any means. What happened on 4 July last year was this; the offender went to a home in North Narrabeen. There are suggestions that the offender believed that it was a cocaine dealer who lived in the home, but he was wrong about that. In any event, whether he thought there was a cocaine dealer living there or not, he went there with the intention of stealing items from the home. He broke in by forcing some locks and began to remove electrical equipment, including a plasma TV and a Foxtel decoding box. The noise of the offender breaking in and removing the electrical equipment has caused one of the occupants of the premises to walk downstairs to see what was going on. She had her seventeen month old grandchild in her hands, and was on the phone as she walked downstairs. She saw what was happening and immediately, and understandably, screamed. Her partner therefore came down the stairs as well. He grabbed the offender and held him. It was at this stage that the offender pulled the syringe from his right hand pocket and pointed it towards the gentleman who had hold of him, which caused him, again quite understandably, to release the offender, who ran away. The offender was at the time in company with another man, as I have mentioned; he was remaining outside as the lookout.5 A short time later police went to the offender’s home. He and Mr Parkes, who was there with him, matched the description given by the victims of the offence and so they were arrested. The offender has remained in custody since that day.6 The offender comes from a loving family. He is very fortunate indeed to have the support of his parents who are present here today. They have supported him, despite his relatively regular offending in the past. The offender has committed similar offences and been dealt with by being sentenced to periods of imprisonment in the past. He has also been dealt with under the provisions of the Mental Health Act due to a circumstance I will now set out. The offender may well have suffered from some brain damage as a result of a Rhesus factor complication, which became apparent either at or soon after his birth. He also has displayed symptoms of mental illness in the past. He has described symptoms of psychotic origin and has been a person who is keen to obtain both prescription and non-prescription drugs which he has used regularly. Despite his parents’ best endeavours to prevent their son being prescribed with inappropriate medication he has been able to have various prescription drugs prescribed for him. In fact, on the very day of committing this offence there is evidence to suggest that the offender was under the influence of prescription medication. There is certainly evidence that he was not thinking as clearly as he might in the absence of such medication.7 The fact that the offender has possibly suffered brain damage and certainly has suffered at time from mental illness, has multiple consequences. It makes the offender an inappropriate person to visit upon a sentence which has a substantial component of general deterrence built into it. It also suggests the possibility that he will do his time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. I note from Dr Westmore’s report that he has spent some time in the mental health unit in Silverwater prison but has recently been discharged. However, although general deterrence may play less of a role in the sentence I will shortly announce, there is no reason that I should not impose a sentence which contains within it a substantial component of personal deterrence. The offender seems to be aware, from the material before me, that if he fails to take his medication and if he continues to take prescription drugs to excess, and consume illegal drugs, then he will commit criminal offences. The consequences of doing so need to be brought home in a very firm way. It is for that reason that the offender himself needs to be personally deterred from indulging in activities which will necessarily lead to him committing further offences. 8 The offence carries with it a standard non-parole period of five years which remains as a guidepost despite the plea of guilty. The maximum penalty is as high as twenty years. Those two factors indicate the seriousness with which the Legislature, and I believe the community, regard offences of this nature. The community is rightfully concerned about the prevalence of offences where such as the present, where seemingly without care, offenders break into other people’s homes to get valuable items, simply so that they can be swapped for drugs. The matter to be taken into account is also a serious matter involving the use of a weapon as an element of the offence. No doubt, Mr Shaw, the man who had the weapon pointed at him, experienced a great deal of, at least, anxiety at the possibility that the syringe would actually be used upon him. 9 There are prospects for the offender’s rehabilitation but no one would suggest that they can be described as good, at this stage. As I mentioned he is very fortunate to have the support of supportive and loving parents who, nevertheless, have an appropriate and realistic attitude towards the prospects of him living with them upon his release from custody.10 The offender pleaded guilty at an early stage, and so I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent to reflect that circumstance.11 Mr Fraser asked that I find special circumstances. I will do so. It is clear from Dr Westmore’s report that if the offender is to avoid spending substantial parts of his life in gaol he will be required to make efforts himself with long term community based drug rehabilitation programs. He needs to maintain regular contact with the Mental Health Service which, as Dr Westmore suggests, should have a multidisciplinary team of social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists who are able to deal with the many problems that the offender presents.12 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 4 July 2006. It will expire on 3 January 2008. I set a head sentence of three years. As well as the standard conditions of parole upon his release from parole the offender is to obey all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service, including maintaining and attending any long term community based drug rehabilitation programs recommended by the Probation and Parole Service. He is also to maintain regular contact with the Mental Health Service, preferably one which has a multidisciplinary team attached to it, including social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him on 11 May 2006 in respect of three counts of receiving stolen property contrary to s 188 of the Crimes Act 1900. The offences each carried a maximum penalty of twelve years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The sentencing judge determined to impose a non-parole period of 16 months commencing 11 May 2006 and expiring on 10 September 2007 in relation to each offence. His Honour imposed an additional term of 14 months making the overall sentence in respect of each count one of 2½ years imprisonment to be served concurrently. When imposing the sentence his Honour indicated that but for the plea of guilty the applicant would have been sentenced to a total term of 3 years in relation to each count. His Honour also had regard to matters on a Form 1 relating to an offence of receiving stolen parts of a Holden motorcar. 
     
      
    3 At the sentencing hearing the judge received an agreed statement of facts which formed the basis for his Honour’s findings. That statement disclosed that the applicant is a vehicle spray painter by trade and has extensive experience in the smash repair industry. He owns and occupies premises at Lot 20 Tindale Road, Eatonsville which consists of a dwelling and three large sheds. Two of the sheds were used primarily for the storage of motor vehicles and parts and the third shed was set up as a fully equipped mechanical workshop. 
     
      
    4 When the applicant’s premises were searched by police they discovered motorcycles and motorcars. They were in various stages of the “re-birthing” process. That process, as I understand it, refers to an enterprise where vehicles which have been stolen are altered so as to disguise their true identity and provided with false identification numbers and other changes are made. Apart from the vehicles which were undergoing re-birthing, the police also discovered numerous other vehicle parts, stamping tools and welding and mechanical equipment.  
     
      
    5 When the premises were searched the applicant denied that he knew that the vehicles were stolen or that he had been involved in the re-birthing process of the vehicles. 
     
      
    6 Following the search, investigations continued. It was ultimately found that the vehicles referred to in each of the counts were stolen. Various alterations had been made to each of them to remove the original vehicle identification number and replace it with a false number. During the course of those investigations the applicant submitted documents to the police by which he attempted to establish that the chassis of one of the seized vehicles was that of a wrecked vehicle and had been fitted with an engine which he had bought independently. The applicant produced receipts in relation to the alleged purchase of the engine. However, forensic analysis ultimately demonstrated that this was an impossibility and that the vehicle which the police located had its original chassis and engine but with altered numbers. 
     
      
    7 With respect to count 3 which concerned a motorcycle, the agreed facts disclosed that the false identification number which had been stamped onto its frame was consistent with having been made by a stamp that was found on the applicant’s property and which he confirmed belonged to him. The applicant originally responded to the police investigation with an apparently innocent account of how he came by the motorcycle. However, that explanation turned out to be a fabrication.  
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge described the offences as being “what is commonly described as a vehicle re-birthing case.” His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now s 188 I am sure can cover many situations and accordingly I make it clear that the material is all placed before me to show that this was an enterprise in which stolen vehicles were being given a new false identity to enable them to be sold and money gained in respect of that.” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour determined that the fact that the various items were received in the course of a re-birthing enterprise was an aggravating feature of the offence. His Honour further determined that the offences involved planning. His Honour was unable to determine who else may have been involved in the enterprise but was satisfied that the applicant was playing a significant role in the operation. His Honour was also satisfied that this was not a case of “one-off” there being three vehicles processed improperly, which his Honour determined affected the overall gravity of the offences. 
     
      
    10 There was little, if any, discussion of the relevant facts in submissions made at the sentencing hearing. The agreed statement of facts was tendered and the applicant did not give evidence. 
     
      
    11 The submissions of counsel for the applicant at the hearing were confined to emphasising the favourable elements of the applicant’s personal circumstances. A submission was made that although a term of imprisonment may be appropriate this should be served by other than full time custody. The submission did not particularise whether this should be by a suspended sentence or periodic detention. 
     
      
    12 Although the applicant pleaded guilty this was not done at the first opportunity. Indeed, as I have indicated, the response of the applicant to the original police investigation was to provide untruthful accounts in an effort to avoid prosecution. His Honour found that the applicant was entitled to the benefit of the fact that he had never been convicted of any offence involving dishonesty and had regard to a number of references from persons emphasising how highly regarded the applicant was in the community. His Honour also had regard to the fact that although the offences were discovered in July 2003 there was a significant delay in his prosecution, which was in part due to the applicant’s response to the police investigations. In that time the applicant fathered two children which his Honour found to be a significant incentive to the applicant to be of good behaviour in the future. His Honour also found that there were significant prospects of the offender being rehabilitated. His Honour also found that there were special circumstances in that the sentence which his Honour determined to impose would be the first sentence of imprisonment to be imposed upon the applicant. 
     
      
    13 When determining the appropriate sentence his Honour had regard to the fact that although there were three separate charges they were related, in that they each formed part of the re-birthing enterprise. His Honour concluded that “an overall sentence, concurrent on each count (would be) appropriate but that sentence has been arrived at on the basis that there were 3 vehicles not just one.” His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now I further say about these offences, the authorities make it clear they are seriously regarded by the community. They call for sentences of imprisonment and there is no reason that I can find in the material before me to depart from that overall requirement. 
        
       
       
        
        I have been addressed on behalf of the offender on the basis that any sentence should be suspended. I must say that that, of necessity, depends on an assessment of the overall sentence as coming within sentences that can be suspended and also the alternative gives rise to whether or not, if it does not come within that range, whether or not there are special circumstances.” 
        
       
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    14 The only ground of appeal is that his Honour failed to properly consider alternatives to full time custody and, in particular, should have concluded that the sentence could be served by way of periodic detention. No complaint is made in relation to the term of the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    15 In my opinion, the sentencing judge correctly determined that the offences required a term of imprisonment. As that term was determined at more than two years it could not be suspended (see s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). However, as the term of imprisonment did not exceed three years, it would have been possible for his Honour to direct that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention (see s 6 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). 
     
      
    16 His Honour’s remarks on sentence do not reveal any consideration of periodic detention. This may be explained by the fact that counsel for the applicant did not submit that periodic detention may be appropriate. His Honour probably understood counsel’s submission to be confined to a suggestion that a suspended sentence would be appropriate. 
     
      
    17 When sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment the court is required to firstly determine the appropriate sentence. Once that has been determined it is necessary to consider whether there are any alternatives to full time imprisonment and whether that alternative should be utilised. In appropriate circumstances the alternatives include suspension of the sentence or periodic detention. These principles were considered by Howie J in R v Zamagias (2002) NSWCCA 17 [28]-[30]. 
     
      
    18 As Howie J explained a failure of a court to expressly state that it has followed a two step approach in arriving at sentence does not itself reveal error. However, it “may lead this Court to examine carefully the findings made by the sentencing judge to determine whether the sentence is erroneous.” 
     
      
    19 Although his Honour did not refer to the possibility of periodic detention when sentencing the applicant I am not persuaded that the sentence which was imposed was erroneous. His Honour sentenced the applicant having regard to his findings that the offences were committed as part of an organised re-birthing operation of stolen motor vehicles. Regrettably this type of illegal enterprise is not uncommon. It inflicts considerable loss on those members of the community whose vehicles are stolen, as well as inflicting loss on any insurer who may have obligations to provide compensation. Being part of a deliberate and organised criminal enterprise, in my view a fulltime custodial sentence was appropriate. Although the applicant was entitled to consideration for his plea of guilty, his prior good character and favourable references, these matters did not displace the need for a sentence which provided both adequate punishment and effective deterrence of others. 
     
      
    20 Although I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss that appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Following a trial before Wood CJ at CL and a jury the appellant was convicted of murder. There was an alternative count on the indictment, namely the use of an offensive weapon in company to avoid lawful apprehension (s 33B(2) Crimes Act 1900). The appellant was tried with a co-accused, Meli Lagi, who was acquitted of murder but found guilty of the alternative count (R v Lagi [2004] NSWCCA 443). 
     
      
    2 The charges arose from the fatal shooting of Snr Const Glen McEnallay on 27 March 2002 at Hillsdale. When considering a “no case” application Wood CJ at CL summarised the facts upon which the Crown case was based which provides an appropriate summary for the purpose of this appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 27 March 2002 Senior Constable McEnallay was driving an unmarked police patrol car in Bunnerong Road, Matraville. Near the intersection with Military Road he observed a green Holden Commodore sedan, registration number AJK 32M. The possible presence of this vehicle in the area had previously been reported to him by an off duty police officer, Constable Dietrich, who had seen it at about 5:30 pm travelling at speed, and somewhat erratically, in Botany Road, Matraville.  
        
       
       
        
        Senior Constable McEnallay asked for a vehicle check to be made and was advised that it had been reported as stolen.  
        
       
       
        
        He followed the green Commodore into Botany Road, and then right into Beauchamp Street. The two vehicles stopped at the lights controlling the intersection of Beauchamp Street and Denison Road. In the meantime he had asked for assistance from other vehicles, and had also requested the driver of a caged police vehicle, which was in the area, to drop back, as he did not want the occupants of the green Commodore to be aware that they were being followed.  
        
       
       
        
        In Dennison Street, at about 5:51:50, Senior Constable McEnallay activated his siren and lights, announcing his pursuit of the green Commodore, which made a right hand turn at speed into Grace Campbell Crescent. While attempting this turn the vehicle struck the gutter, or a traffic island, and came to a stop at about 5:52:10, as a result of damage occasioned to a wheel, which effectively immobilised it.  
        
       
       
        
        At this stage Penisini, who was armed with a .38 Smith and Wesson revolver, exited the green Commodore and immediately fired 5 shots, in quick succession, at the driver's side window of the police vehicle which had come to a stop about 10 metres away. Senior Constable McEnallay, who had been unable in the time available to draw his own weapon, or to seek a position of safety, suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and head which led to his death, seven days later on 3 April 2002. The five shots, of which four struck home, were fired in a public place, in the midst of a residential precinct and in an area where there were a number of pedestrians and children, some of whom gave evidence in the trial of Lagi and Taufahema.  
        
       
       
        
        Penisini, along with the other occupants of the green Commodore who included Lagi and John Taufahema, ran from the vehicle in a general easterly direction, through some units in Nilson Avenue and Grace Campbell Crescent. On their way, Penisini dropped his handgun, and a pouch containing a number of .45 calibre and .38 calibre cartridges, on the footpath outside 9 Grace Campbell Crescent. Eight other live rounds were recovered on the following day, four of which had been dropped on the roadway outside 9 Nilson Avenue, and the remainder of which had been dropped in the rear yard of those premises. 
        
       
       
        
        Lagi was seen to drop his weapon, a .38 Smith and Wesson revolver, in the garden of 12 Grace Campbell Crescent, on his way to a residence at 5 Rhodes Street, where he managed to hide from police, in a laundry, for several hours, before eventually making his way home. Before doing so, he exchanged his clothes for clothing which he found in the laundry. He was not arrested until 3 April, although prior thereto arrangements had been made, through his solicitor, for him to surrender to police on 4 April.  
        
       
       
        
        John Taufahema and Penisini also made their way towards Rhodes Street. They were pursued on foot by Senior Constable Day and Constable Kolosque. While moving through the small area of park, which runs between the premises 7 and 9 Grace Campbell Crescent respectively, and up a hill to Rhodes Street, John Taufahema presented his handgun, a .38 Smith and Wesson five round revolver, at Constables Day and Kolosque and threatened to shoot them if they did not back off.  
        
       
       
        
        Both officers courageously maintained their pursuit. They had drawn their own service weapons, and repeatedly warned Penisini and Taufahema to stop and to drop the weapon which the latter was holding.  
        
       
       
        
        When they reached Rhodes Street, the two offenders made their way north, still pursued by Constables Day and Kolosque. A motor vehicle driven by Lamia Kassis was observed to be slowing for a speed hump. John Taufahema made his way to the driver’s side of this vehicle, and pointing his weapon at Ms Kassis, instructed her to get out of the vehicle. She complied with this request. In the meantime Penisini attempted to force his way into the front passenger seat.  
        
       
       
        
        At this point Constables Day and Kolosque caught up with the men and began to struggle with them. Senior Constable Day attempted to subdue Penisini, and eventually did so after hitting him over the head with his service pistol and spraying him with OC spray. Constable Kolosque fought with Taufahema, who was still holding his handgun and pointing it at the two officers. They struggled over the ignition key, and at one stage Taufahema managed to get the vehicle into motion, but it moved backwards, striking a vehicle behind it.  
        
       
       
        
        Eventually Taufahema was overpowered by Constable Kolosque, with the assistance of Senior Constable Day, who had come to his aid, although not before being struck on the head several times with the butt of a service weapon and also being sprayed with OC spray.  
        
       
       
        
        In the meantime, Penisini, who had been sitting for a while on a fence, no doubt being still affected by the spray, had moved away from the vehicle into the park to the east of Rhodes Street. He was pursued by Senior Constable Day, and with the assistance of Constable Rowbottom, was arrested in that park. The weapon of John Taufahema was recovered from the vicinity of Ms Kassis’ vehicle.  
        
       
       
        
        It is inappropriate to make any further reference to Motekiaa Taufahema, since he is yet to face his trial, other than to observe that he was seen to be in the company of the three offenders now before the Court, and to have been the driver of the green Commodore, at about 5 pm. He was arrested in the rear yard of premises at 31 Rhodes Street, moments after the arrest of John Taufahema, and a .357 Magnum six-chamber revolver, which he was seen to drop in the garden of 33 Rhodes Street, was recovered in that location.  
        
       
       
        
        A search of the green Commodore revealed that contained within it were gloves, hats and an ice hockey mask, items capable of being used as disguises. Additionally and adjacent to, or in, Ms Kassis’ vehicle were found another pair of gloves and a cap. Penisini was seen to be wearing sunglasses.  
        
       
       
        
        Each of the four weapons recovered this night had been stolen from a security company two weeks earlier. The weapons of the two offenders now before the Court were fully loaded and were not fired during the relevant events. Nor was that of Mottekiaa Taufahema.  
        
       
       
        
        It was the possession of one of these handguns by Lagi, which gave rise to the firearm offence to which he pleaded guilty. The offences concerning the vehicle of Ms Kassis, and the use of a firearm, to which each of Penisini and John Taufahema pleaded guilty, related to the events which I have outlined as having occurred in the vicinity of the speed hump in Rhodes Street.” 
        
       
      
    3 The appellant’s brother, Motekiai Taufahema stood trial separately and was convicted of murder. That conviction was quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered by the Court of Criminal Appeal (Taufahema v The Queen (2006) 162 A Crim R 152). A Crown application for special leave to appeal from that judgment was heard by the Full High Court on 7 December 2006. The decision is reserved. 
     
      
    4 As Wood CJ at CL noted, Penisini, who fired the fatal shots, pleaded guilty to a charge of murder. 
     
      
    5 The Crown advanced the charge of murder on two alternative bases. The first alleged a joint criminal enterprise “common purpose” murder. The second alleged “felony murder”, for which the foundational crime was a breach of s 33 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    6 The appellant says that the trial judge made a significant error in his directions with respect to the necessary elements for a charge of joint criminal enterprise common purpose murder. It is further submitted that, notwithstanding the agreement of counsel that the alternate verdict of manslaughter should not be left to the jury, his Honour should have done so. 
     
      
       
      The genesis of the problem 
       
      
    7 The genesis of the primary problem identified by the appellant is found in the Crown opening. During the course of that opening the Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says that and what has to be established also is that in joining in that joint criminal enterprise to use the guns in the sense I’ve described, not necessarily fire them, that they contemplated the possibility that someone might suffer injury or serious injury or death.  
        It is the Crown case that in that way if they contemplated the possibility of injury or death arising from the use of the weapon or the weapons to avoid lawful apprehension, that is enough, 
         if in fact injury and then death results from the use of those weapons, even if they did not intend that anyone, any individual, would be shot.” 
        
       
      
    8 I have emphasised the words which are said to give cause for complaint.  
     
      
    9 In the course of his closing address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You might equally be satisfied, and I submit that you would be satisfied, that they are guilty because of both ways, both alternative ways that the Crown seeks to prove murder. It matters not which each of you were satisfied about so long as ultimately, as his Honour will tell you, at the end of the day you are all satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accuseds’ guilt of that offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The first way concerns the Crown saying that each of these accused was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with Sione Penisini to avoid lawful apprehension and that that joint criminal enterprise involved the intended use of any one of their guns, by either brandishing or pointing the gun at the police officer, with the intention of enabling them to get away. 
        
       
       
        
        In that joint enterprise,  
        if you are satisfied also that the accused with whom you are dealing contemplated the possibility that someone, namely the police officer, might suffer serious injury or death even though he did not intend that the police officer be shot and did not intend much less that the officer be seriously injured or killed but, having contemplated the possibility of serious injury or death being occasioned, the accused embarked on that criminal enterprise, then the law says he is guilty of murder 
        . Even though, as I said, he didn’t intend that death would be occasioned, didn’t intend that the victim be seriously injured, didn’t intend that the victim would be shot but contemplated the possibility that it might happen. 
        
       
       
        
        If they contemplated the possibility of serious injury or death and embarked on that criminal enterprise together with Penisini then that accused is guilty of murder that way.” 
        
       
      
    10 Again, the words about which particular complaint is made have been emphasised. 
     
      
       
      The written directions 
       
      
    11 In the course of counsel’s address to the jury and before his Honour summed-up, the trial judge, as is now common, provided the jury with written directions. They were provided before counsel for the appellant addressed the jury. In relation to “joint enterprise murder” the directions were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(ii) Count 1: Murder 
        
       
       
        
        (i) Joint Enterprise Murder 
        
       
       
        
        What the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt are the following elements: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The accused whose case you are considering was party to a joint enterprise with the men who were in his company that if faced with the possibility of being arrested, one or other of them would use a firearm with intent to prevent such arrest. 
        
       
       
        
        (b)  
        The accused whose case you are considering contemplated that it was possible that, in using a firearm to prevent their arrest, the user would do so in a way that either resulted in the death of, or really serious bodily injury to the person attempting to arrest them 
        ; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) With that possibility in contemplation, the accused continued to participate in that joint enterprise. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) Penisini was party to that joint enterprise, and  
        used 
         his firearm by shooting Constable McEnallay for the purpose of preventing their lawful arrest and with the intention of killing such Officer or of causing him grievous bodily harm; and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) As a result of a shot or shots fired by Penisini Constable McEnallay died: 
        
       
       
        
        “Use” means presentation or brandishing of a firearm. 
        
       
       
        
        What the accused must contemplate as a possibility is that the firearm would be used in a way that resulted in the death or really serious bodily injury of another person. 
        ” (emphasis, but for paragraph (d) added) 
        
       
      
    12 I have again emphasised the words which give rise to the appellant’s complaint. 
     
      
       
      The submission of trial counsel 
       
      
    13 The submission of the appellant in this appeal was that para (b) of the written direction failed to tell the jury that before they could convict the appellant of murder on the basis of a joint enterprise they must be satisfied that the appellant contemplated, not only that Penisini would use a firearm, but that he would do so with the intention of killing or inflicting really serious bodily injury upon the policeman. The error is said to be encapsulated in the final paragraph of the written direction which provides only that the “accused must contemplate as a possibility” … “that the firearm would be used in a way that resulted in the death or really serious bodily injury of another person” rather than used with the intention of causing death or really serious bodily injury. A similar deficiency is submitted to be present in the opening remarks of the Crown Prosecutor to which I have earlier referred. 
     
      
    14 Although no complaint was made about his Honour’s directions at the trial counsel for the appellant put the matter differently. In the course of his address to the jury he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my submission to you that it is a very big ask to suggest that John Taufahema at that time at the car had that contemplation, that it was known that Penisini would do what he did and do it intentionally. Some things to consider when you are considering that element of the offence is there is a problem of opportunity for that kind of contemplation. All this happened very quickly. The pursuit happened in a matter of seconds. It did not give Mr Taufahema very much time at all I would suggest to contemplate such a possibility. It must be proved beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Taufahema subjectively himself had that contemplation.” 
        
       
       
      The summing up of the judge 
       
      
    15 Apart from the written directions the trial judge dealt with the question of joint enterprise murder at a number of points in his summing-up. 
     
      
    16 Having reminded the jury that he had provided them with written directions his Honour confirmed that the Crown presented the case in two ways. His Honour firstly considered joint enterprise murder and after referring to the written directions said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… but it arises as a matter of law where two or more people enter into a joint enterprise to a joint understanding or agreement to do a particular act. If, in the course of carrying out that act, something further is done which is in the contemplation of the accused whose case you are considering as a possibility, then that accused is also criminally responsible for it even though it may not have been the immediate object of a common enterprise and even though that result was not intended or done by that particular person.” 
        
       
      
    17 His Honour then provided an illustration from a hypothetical bank robbery. No complaint is made of his Honour’s use of the illustration or of the elements of the offence which are contained within it. His Honour speaks in the illustration of knowledge of the possibility that the shooter would use a weapon “intentionally to kill or to cause really serious bodily harm.” Pausing to consider how the jury may identify a person’s state of mind his Honour then turns to consider with particularity the elements of a joint enterprise murder. Reminding the jury of para (a) of the written directions his Honour then in referring to para (b) says: 
     
      
       
        
        “Next, the accused whose case you are considering contemplated that it was possible that in using a firearm to prevent their arrest, the [user] would do so in a way that either resulted in the death of or really serious bodily injury to the person who was attempting to arrest them.” 
        
       
      
    18 Having considered the other paragraphs of the written direction his Honour discusses the meaning of “use” saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “To achieve that result you might think that the weapon has to actually be discharged but “use” does encompass not only the actual firing of the weapon but also its presentation or pointing at someone, although clearly merely pointing at it would not normally present the possibility, the consequence of death or really serious bodily harm.” 
        
       
      
    19 Complaint is made by the appellant that in framing his directions to the jury in this manner his Honour, rather than identifying the elements necessary for a joint enterprise murder, has directed the jury in terms of manslaughter where an intention to kill or cause serious harm is not required. It is submitted that the mere presentation or pointing of the weapon at someone, in the absence of evidence of an intention to discharge so as to kill or injure another person could not constitute murder. 
     
      
    20 Later, in the summing-up when referring to the case presented by the Crown Prosecutor, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Initially, the way the Crown pursued its case of murder, the Crown Prosecutor recognised there was no evidence of any conversation between the men in the green Commodore, either during the pursuit or after the vehicle was immobilised. He asked you to infer from the evidence as a whole that they entered into the joint enterprise whereby one or other of them – and it turned out to be Penisini – would use a firearm by pointing it at the police officer so as to prevent their apprehension and the supporting inference that they each contemplated the possibility that if a gun was used in that fashion, then there was a possibility of a police officer being killed or occasioned really serious bodily harm.” 
        
       
      
    21 The appellant complained of this direction that his Honour had not identified for the jury the necessity for the Crown to prove that the appellant contemplated the possibility that the gun would not only be used, but, used with the intention of killing or injuring the policeman. 
     
      
    22 After completing a summary of the Crown submissions his Honour directed the jury’s attention to the submissions of counsel for the defence. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So, he submitted today, that the essential foundations of the Crown case requiring proof of John Taufahema’s adherence to a joint enterprise are simply not established. He said it was a very big ask to infer that he contemplated the possibility that Penisini would use his gun intentionally in a way that would bring about death or occasion serious bodily harm to a police officer. In that regard, he invited you to take into account what he submitted to be an insufficient opportunity for him to form that necessary contemplation in his mind. He further submitted that Penisini’s act was inconceivably stupid and vicious and not the kind of event that would have been within his contemplation, and he also said there was no suggestion that he behaved himself in a similar way, for example, by pointing his weapon at the police vehicle or at the police officer.” 
        
       
      
    23 After the jury had retired to consider its verdict they delivered a question to his Honour. That question sought a definition of joint enterprise. His Honour responded by saying, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where joint enterprise comes into this case is that the Crown says in relation to the murder count that there was a joint agreement or understanding between the three men that a weapon would be used by one of them to prevent their lawful arrest in a situation where they were confronting arrest by Police Officer McEnallay. Clearly, in a situation such as that, the person who presents the gun or uses the gun has committed an offence of using a weapon with intent to prevent lawful arrest. 
        
       
       
        
        The joint enterprise between them was relied upon to extend the liability of the people who do not use the gun but who were party to the understanding, but that requires the Crown to prove that those other persons, that is the person who did not use the gun, contemplated the possibility that in using the weapon the man who used it would do it in a way which brought about the death or serious bodily injury of another person.” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour continued repeating that formulation of the elements which the Crown was required to prove. His Honour finished by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “The joint enterprise is the understanding or agreement between them, and if the parties contemplate the possibility that one of them will do something in the course of it that will bring about a particular result, here death or grievous bodily harm, then their criminal liability attaches even though they might not themselves have used the weapon.” 
        
       
      
    25 Without retiring the foreperson of the jury asked a further question in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “We just wanted to clarify – what we really were wanting to know, is the joint enterprise to kill Constable McEnallay or can a joint criminal enterprise be for anything, for example, that they were going to do something else.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I understand the position. The joint enterprise which you are concerned with is a joint enterprise for the murder count to use a weapon for the purpose of preventing their lawful arrest. You can forget about any other joint enterprise. If you think they were on a joint enterprise to go off and commit a robbery in Melbourne or do something else, put that out of your mind because that is not relevant for this joint enterprise. The joint enterprise you are concerned with is an understanding or agreement that one or other of them would, when they are confronted with Constable McEnallay having stopped his vehicle behind them, use his weapon for the purpose of preventing their lawful arrest. If they contemplated the possibility that in using his weapon in a way that would bring about, that is intentionally in a way that would bring about the death or serious bodily injury of Constable McEnallay then the Crown has proved joint enterprise murder.” 
        
       
       
      Discussion 
       
      
    27 The appellant submitted that his Honour’s written direction failed to correctly identify the elements necessary for joint enterprise murder. The problem, acknowledged by the Crown in this appeal, is that the direction did not state that the appellant must have contemplated that it was possible that Penisini would have deliberately pulled the trigger of the gun intending to cause death or grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    28 It is submitted that this problem also infects the oral directions. Even where intention is referred to, his Honour expressed it in the phrase “intentionally in a way that would bring about …. ” which does not convey the essential idea that the appellant had to contemplate that Penisini would discharge the firearm intending death or serious bodily injury. It is submitted that use of the words “in a way” and the extended meaning given to the word “use” in the directions, which is said to mean “presentation or brandishing” of a firearm, effectively confined the jury to consideration of the elements of the offence of manslaughter.  
     
      
    29 I have indicated that the jury sought further directions on the matter. It is submitted that the further directions do not cure any of the existing problems. It is accepted that the maintenance of the word “use” meaning “brandish” or “present” and the continued use of the words “in a way”, convey foresight that Penisini would deliberately brandish the gun that may bring about death or serious bodily injury, but omit the necessary requirement that the appellant foresaw that Penisini might use the gun with the intention of killing or seriously injuring the constable. 
     
      
    30 In my opinion the appellant’s submission must be accepted. The offence of murder relevantly required in Penisini an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the policeman: (the offence was not advanced on the basis of reckless indifference (s 18(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900)). 
     
      
    31 In R v Sharah (1992) 30 NSWLR 292 Carruthers J with whom Gleeson CJ and Smart J agreed said of common purpose murder: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is well-established that there are two classes of common purpose murder. The first class is where the Crown proves that the accused was present and that the deceased was killed in accordance with an understanding or arrangement to which the accused was a party and that that understanding or arrangement included the intent charged, that is, either to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. The second class of case is where the accused lends himself to a criminal enterprise knowing that a potentially lethal weapon was being carried by one of his companions and in the event that it is in fact used by one of his partners with an intent sufficient for murder, then the accused too will be guilty of that offence of murder if the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused contemplated that in the carrying out of the common unlawful purpose, one of his partners might use a lethal weapon with the intention of at least causing serious bodily harm. In the recent case of  
        Hui Chi-ming v The Queen  
        [1992] 1 AC 34 (a case to which, I regret to say, this Court was not referred by either party) the Privy Council were concerned with a case of the second class. The present case is also within the second class.” 
        
       
      
    32 See also the discussion in McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 18 3 CLR 108 at 114-117. 
     
      
    33 The present case was advanced by the Crown as falling into the “second class” for which, as Carruthers J emphasised, an essential element is that the accompanying person understood that the killer might use a lethal weapon “with the intention of at least causing serious injury.” 
     
      
    34 As I have indicated, the Crown accepted that for the reasons advanced by the appellant there are difficulties, both in the written directions and in the primary oral directions, given by his Honour. However, it was submitted that these problems are overcome by the direction which his Honour finally gave to the jury in response to their question. It is submitted that because the jury were given this as the final direction on the matter it operates to cure any previous problems. 
     
      
    35 In my opinion this submission cannot be accepted. Apart from the fact that the jury had the written directions with them, in the jury room and, given their concern about the issue, it may be presumed they spent time considering them, the final direction which his Honour gave was potentially ambiguous. Although the word “intentionally” is used, it qualifies the manner of use – “in a way” – but does not direct the jury to consider whether it was satisfied that Penisini intended to kill or cause serious harm. In my view, the matter was left with the jury on a basis which would have enabled them to bring in a verdict of murder without having found that the appellant understood that Penisini may possibly have intended to use his gun to kill or seriously injure a policeman. It may be that the evidence would admit of this finding, but in my opinion, the appellant is entitled to be tried by a jury which has been appropriately instructed. The matter was effectively left with the jury on the basis that they could convict on a charge of murder, if they found the elements necessary for joint enterprise manslaughter. 
     
      
    36 In these circumstances, the Crown having disavowed any submission that the jury’s verdict could be sustained on the basis of felony murder, in my opinion, this Court has no alternative but to quash the conviction and order a new trial. 
     
      
       
      Alternative of manslaughter 
       
      
    37 The appellant further submitted that, notwithstanding the agreement of counsel at the trial, the trial judge should have left manslaughter as an available alternative verdict to the murder count. The transcript indicates that the matter was discussed between counsel and the trial judge, the latter being influenced in his approach by the fact that there was an alternative count on the indictment, namely count 2, being the offence under s 33B of the Crimes Act. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “And when you have an alternative count on the indictment which is less than manslaughter, that seems to be the logical way to handle it.” 
        
       
      
    38 In R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385 this Court considered the relevant principles which a trial court should apply when consideration is being given to whether manslaughter can be left as an alternative verdict in a murder trial. Hunt AJA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The following propositions follow from those cases: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Manslaughter cannot be left for the determination of the jury as an alternative verdict in a murder trial unless there is evidence to support such a verdict (or unless the case on manslaughter is “viable”). 
        
       
       
        
        (2) However, if in a murder trial the jury nevertheless returns a verdict of manslaughter where there is no evidence to support it, the judge may request them to reconsider the matter but, if they persist in that verdict, the judge must accept it. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, the judge must leave that issue to the jury — notwithstanding that it has not been raised by any party, and even if a party objects (or all parties object) to the issue being left to the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) (a) If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, and if the judge has not left that issue (for whatever reason), there has been an error of law. 
         
          
          (b) Subject to the provisions of the  
          Criminal Appeal Rules,  
          r 4 (see pars [99]–[100]  
          infra 
          ), the appellant is entitled to a new trial unless the Crown establishes that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
           
          (c) In determining whether there has been such a substantial miscarriage, it is not permissible to reason that the jury’s verdict of guilty of murder at the first trial excludes any consideration of the alternative verdict of manslaughter at the new trial.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 In Gilbert v R (2000) 201 CLR 414 the High Court considered a circumstance not dissimilar to the present case. The distinguishing feature was that in that case the judge told the jury that if the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that his brother intended, either to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the victim, the accused was guilty of murder. If not, and, if the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew before they got to the scene of the crime that the intention of anyone was to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, the verdict must be one of not guilty. The accused was convicted of murder. 
     
      
    40 Before the Court of Appeal of Queensland it was common ground that manslaughter should have been left to the jury as a possible verdict. However, that court dismissed the accused’s appeal against conviction on the ground that no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred. 
     
      
    41 By majority the High Court reversed the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal. In doing so the court adopted with approval a passage from the judgment of McLachlin J speaking for a majority in the Supreme Court of Canada in R v Jackson [1993] 4 SCR 573. In that case the trial judge had correctly directed the jury in relation to murder and the jury returned that verdict. However, McLachlin J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Nevertheless, I agree with the Court of Appeal that one cannot be satisfied the verdict is just, given the failure of the trial judge to set out the basis for convicting Davy of manslaughter under s 21(1) and (2) and the absence of any instruction that a party may be guilty of manslaughter even though the perpetrator is guilty of murder. As Lord Tucker stated in  
        Bullard v The Queen  
        [1957] AC 635 at 644: ‘Every man on trial for murder has the right to have the issue of manslaughter left to the jury if there is any evidence upon which such a verdict can be given. To deprive him of this right must of necessity constitute a grave miscarriage of justice and it is idle to speculate what verdict the jury would have reached.’” 
        
       
      
    42 When adopting this passage Gleeson CJ and Gummow J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “McLachlin J said that, in such circumstances, the test for the application of the proviso is whether it is clear that a jury, properly instructed, would necessarily have returned a verdict of murder.” 
        
       
      
    43 In the present case even if there was not the identified problem in the directions given in relation to joint enterprise murder, in my opinion, the evidence before the jury was capable of supporting a conviction for manslaughter. The alternative verdict should have been left with the jury (see also Gillard v R (2003) 219 CLR 1). 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    44 In my opinion the appeal must be upheld, the conviction for murder quashed and a new trial ordered. 
     
      
    45 SIMPSON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    46 PRICE J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

   Sentence1 HIS HONOUR: Quang Het Tran is described by his niece as a loving and caring husband to her aunt and a devoted father to his son. He, willingly, she says, “Helps out with the cooking and cleaning and always has time for his family. He is supportive and ready to offer help to any family member when in need or in trouble”.2 Yet on 12 August 2005, he imported into Australia $600,000 worth of heroin concealed in the lining of a suitcase and two hard covered books. The total weight of the pure heroin was 861 grams.3 Today, this forty-six year old Australian citizen of Vietnamese origin, is to be held accountable for his serious criminal offending. 4 As sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence, before this Court, committed by this offender, harming this community, see R v Gladeu [1999] SCR 688 at [80]. 5 My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of this offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, principally those set out in s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cwlth). 6 The starting point for such assessments requires the sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to both the offence and to the offender. My fact finding task has been circumscribed in this case, in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts, to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court, a judge is not party to any agreement in respect of the facts tendered before him or her. The tender of agreed facts does not relieve the judge from his fact finding responsibility. It simply limits the material from which those facts may be found. To the extent if it be the case, the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must remembered that the Court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it.7 As I said, this is an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth. Section 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cwlth). Requires the sentencing Court to take into account a number of specific matters. The 16A matters have the advantage of providing a useful checklist of matters relevant to sentencing. Where a term of imprisonment greater than three years is to be imposed, as indeed one must be in this case - the length of the non-parole period must be determined.8 What weight needs to be given to all these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus, the protection of the community will also need to be determined. See R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594, R v Hayes [1984] 1NSWLR 740.Facts: 9 Mr Tran arrived at the Kingsford Smith Airport on the morning of 12 August 2005. He was returning from Ho Chi Minh city. Travelling with him were his wife and son. He claimed to have travelled to Vietnam to see his mother, as he believed she had had a stroke. He had made three trips back to Vietnam leave as is 2003 (report of Anita Duffy). This, it would seem, was his fourth trip. 10 The defence case is that he owes his sister a sum of money which he thinks is between $30,000.00 and $40,000.00 as a result of her funding his trips to Vietnam. At the time of arrest, Tran told the police he was on Centrelink benefits. Upon his arrival, Customs became interested in two hard covered books. When questioned about the books, the offender claimed they belonged to a friend named, Minh. He claimed not to know the last name of Minh, even though Minh was an older man who had befriended him when he was a young teenager learning to work on the fishing boats.11 Tran claims to have always felt indebted to the man for teaching him skills needed on the fishing boats. Tran claims three hours before the scheduled departure, Minh arrived at the Ho Chi Minh airport with a suitcase full of books. Minh said that the offender’s family had told him where to find Tran.12 The account given was that Minh arrived with a suitcase full of books. There is nothing in the agreed facts that assists me in finding whether the contaminated suitcase was placed in the plane’s hold or stored as cabin baggage. There is nothing in the facts which assists me in knowing whether the contaminated bag or suitcase was the only suitcase the offender brought into the country or whether there were other bags.13 It seems likely there may have been more than one suitcase because his family was with him. Nor have I been assisted in the statement of facts as to the full contents of the contaminated suitcase. For instance, he claims that the suitcase was “full of books”, yet only two books appeared to have been the subject of interest.14 The prosecution can hardly complain in those circumstances if it fails to prove any specified role for the accused. I am left only with what appears to be self serving statements from an offender made to the police and to Ms Robilliard, a forensic psychologist retained by the defence. 15 The Crown’s submission is that, “In the absence of contrary evidence from the offender, the offender is to be regarded as a principal”.16 In the recorded conversation between Tran and the officers of the AFP, Tran puts forward a version suggesting ignorance, trust of Minh, and himself being an unsuspecting courier. 17 The contraband was apparently skilfully concealed behind a wall of black plastic, located around the sides of the suitcase. Behind the black plastic were packages covered with aluminium foil, all held in place by a double sided yellow tape. There were five separate clear plastic bags concealed in that way. The agreed facts says this about the books, 
     
      
      “Deconstruction of the front and back covers of both books revealed three layers of cardboard sheeting together with a thin white piece of paper which was affixed to a sheet of silver foil. In each case, the cavity contained inside each cover revealed two plastic bags containing an amount of loose off-white powder which was covered by numerous layers of clear plastic cling film, containing amounts of brown, granular material believed to be coffee. A total of eight plastic bags containing a loose off-white powder were removed from the two books.”  
      
    18 I am assuming the coffee was there to deceive dogs smelling suitcases.19 The combined bulk weight of powder from all three items was 1680 grams. Purity of samples tested from the books ranged from 71.8 to 75.8 per cent pure heroin. The purity of heroin from the five packets of the suitcase range from 33.4 per cent to 69.8 per cent. Those variations of purity between heroin contained in the suitcase and the books suggests that the heroin found in the suitcase has a different origin from the heroin found in the books. As earlier remarked, the total weight of pure heroin has been put at 861.1 grams.Objective Criminality:20 I come then to the objective criminality. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively, the criminality exhibited in this offence against the criminality of offences of a similar kind that the Court is aware of. It is in this way that the seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality quite clearly must have an important impact upon the overall sentencing result. The objective criminality related to importing comes from the impact of the drugs in their distribution into the Australian community.21 Drugs such as heroin can lead to, create, or sustain drug addicts. Drug addicts are human being whose capacity to function, whose capacity to feel human is smothered to a greater or a lesser extent by any addiction they may experience. And that is the real essence of the criminal harm done by importers of drugs. That is, in a greater or a lesser way, they are contributing to the disenabling of their fellow human beings in the community into which they import the drugs.22 Associated with drug addiction are other forms of crime, such as armed robbery, break, enter and steal. That is, crimes related to a loss of economic gain arising to victims of property, whose own productive efforts have secured that property for them. Associated with those other crimes are trauma, emotional and psychological damage to the victims. Spending of money on drugs by addicts without corresponding productivity by those who import drugs, amounts to a monumental transference of wealth to unscrupulous persons without any corresponding economic gain for the community.23 At any level then, drug dealing is a criminal conduct. At the font of all that drug dealing is the importation of the drugs into this community.24 There can be little doubt that the quantity of heroin imported, was imported for the purpose of on-supply to one or more persons. Given the background of this offender, I cannot be satisfied he is a principal, although on the account he gave to Ms Robilliard, he may well have had a motive for seeking $40,000. But motive and importation alone are insufficient to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that he was a principal.25 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, in part by his plea, and in part by the presence of heroin from two sources in the importation, that he was well aware when he left Vietnam that he was importing heroin into Australia.26 I am satisfied he had at least one person to whom he was delivering the heroin. And as I said, that was for the purpose of on-supplying to others.27 While the offender claimed to be in debt to the tune of $30,000 or $40,000, I do not regard the Crown as establishing that any of that money was used to finance the purchase of the heroin. 28 His claim is, the decision to bring the items containing the contraband was made in Vietnam at two stages. The first one he agreed to bring in the books and the second when he agreed to bring in the suitcase. That is at a time before he got to the airport and at a time when he was at the airport.29 There is nothing in the agreed facts pointing to findings more adverse to him than these. Put another way, the Crown has not proved beyond reasonable doubt, Tran left Australia for the purpose of importing heroin. In those circumstances, his criminality is limited to such arrangements as he made in Vietnam pursuant to an intention he then held to import heroin into Australia.30 At the end of the day, there is insufficient evidence to prove the offender was the prime mover or one of the prime mover in the enterprise. Given that I have come to a view that the heroin comes from two sources, it may well be that there were two people who had invited him to import heroin into Australia. Again, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about that. But I just raise it to dismiss it as an aggravating fact.31 The size of the heroin at 861 grams is certainly well above the trafficable amount. I have referred to its wholesale value at $600,000. That is not just a measure of the unearned transfer of wealth but also a measure of the potential widespread distribution of the harmful effects of this drug into the community.32 I take note that heroin is a drug of high addiction as distinct from other drugs that the Court might be concerned with, of lesser addictive and harmful impact upon those who take it. Its effect upon those who abuse it is rightly regard as pernicious.Planning: 33 I am satisfied that there was a level of planning undertaken, firstly, by those who oversighted the importation and secondly, insofar as the books were concerned, by this offender.34 I am also satisfied that the offender was intended to receive the benefit of the planning related to the concealment of the drugs. In particular, the care and skill taken to conceal the heroin with a view to avoid detection, is a significant feature of this offender’s criminality. It must be understood of course that the monumental centre of the criminality is the actual import into Australia.35 In Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584, the majority observed at para [64], 
     
      
      “In relation to the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin, like features can be identified as bearing upon the formulation of applicable principles. Those features include, the difficulty of detecting the offence and the great social consequences that follow from its commission. The former suggests that deterrence is to be given chief weight in the sentencing task, the latter that stern punishment will be warranted in almost every case”. 
      
    36 As to the question of deterrence, that must be reviewed in the light of submissions made by the defence but that principle in Wong must be a matter that guides me in sentencing.Subjective features, family dynamics, social background:37 Tran is a forty-six year old man of Vietnamese origin. Born in Southern Vietnam, he was the youngest of six children. His father was killed by the communist regime, seven days after he was born. In those circumstances, he obviously never knew his father. 38 Thereafter, his mother while running a small rice selling business, also cared for her family. She remarried when Tran was five but that relationship ended four years later. By this time, there were two new siblings born into the family. Tran reports his mother as now being in frail health. She is blind. He claimed as a reason for travelling to Vietnam his belief she had sustained a stroke. 39 In Australia, his wife has one child, a teenage boy. Tran married in 1989. The son was born in 1993. The family lived with a nephew and his wife in Fairfield. There are apparently tensions in the family regarding his involvement in this drug importation. Education, work skills, employment:40 Tran’s formal education is virtually nonexistent. He appears to have completed his first two years of primary school. He is unable to read or write in Vietnamese or English. He can only offer himself on the labour market as an unskilled worker. 41 It is unclear why his schooling is so limited and was stopped at such an early age. Initially, he assisted his mother in the family rice selling business. In 1980, he arrived as a refugee, having earlier escaped by boat with an uncle to Thailand. Another uncle was living in Australia. The offender made his way from Thailand to Australia to live with that other uncle. He has held a number of unskilled labouring jobs, at a foundry in Chester Hill; at a factory in Bankstown making trolleys and shelving; on the process line of a soft drinks factory; sewing work in another factory at Fairfield; and then casual sewing work at home. His last paid employment appears to have been as a poultry process worker in 2005. Physical health:42 As a child, he suffered epilepsy. While that ailment has apparently abated, he claims speech problems as a legacy of his epilepsy. The problem becomes particularly apparent when he is excited or upset. He has trouble finding words and stutters. Currently, he experiences asthma, which is controlled by medication. There is no problem with illicit drug abuse. Mental health:43 There is no diagnosed psychiatric illness. However, the offender presented to Ms Robilliard with tearfulness. Ms Robilliard, when interviewing him, notes the need to interrupt her sessions because of his being tearful. It is likely he is suffering a reactive depression. Those responsible for his custody should have him assessed.Psychological testing, intellectual capacity: 44 Ms Robilliard testing suggests the offender has a performance IQ of seventy-five and a global intellectual capacity standard score of sixty-seven. If these scores were valid, he would be in a group where somewhere between ninety-five and ninety-nine percent of the population would be more intelligent than he. For my part, I cannot accept these scores as valid. His level of functioning must be significantly higher. Surely, those who know him, would have a reasonable sense of his level of functioning. It is inconceivable were he functioning at that level that he would be lent $40,000 by family members. 45 I have two character references from family members, neither of whom makes any reference to him having limited intellectual functioning. He has a working history over several years. While it is true there are periods of unemployment, he has been able to hold down work positions for more than three years. 46 While the tests are supposedly able to cope with language problems, it is impossible to tell whether there were any interpretation problems from English into Vietnamese.47 Some allowance needs to be made for that. Further, the offender presented as tearful and distressed, at the time of testing. His mood and attitude may also have impacted upon the test results.48 Having said that, I am prepared to regard the test results as indicative of an intellectual slowness, although not of the dimensions Ms Robilliard thought appropriate by applying a rigid correlation of the results against measuring criteria.Contrition:49 There is little doubt the offender is sorry he was caught. He was also incarcerated and is separated from his family. That clearly is also a matter of grieving for him. These are matters causing him significant distress as witnessed by Ms Robilliard. 50 Ms Robilliard says, “He is accepting of the consequences of his actions”. His plea of guilty provides some concrete evidence of that. He recognises the offence as ruining his life. There is however an absence of material suggesting any insight into the wrongfulness of his actions, other than perhaps his plea. But the strength of the Crown case against him and I have no doubt, legal advice, does not make the connection between the plea and any insight into the wrongness of his actions, a strong one. Plea of guilty:51 It is clear his plea has advanced the interests of justice. My understanding is that he pleaded on arraignment. As a practical matter, it has freed up resources of the prosecution and defence agencies to devote to other cases. It has also, of course, saved witnesses, particularly police and customs witnesses the necessity of attending court. 52 This plea in that sense, advances the administration of justice. Likewise, it maintains confidence in the administration of justice by maintaining confidence in the Australian Custom Service and the Australian Federal Police’s capacity to investigate crimes of this kind and keep the borders relatively free of illicit contraband entering Australia.53 In those circumstances, an allowance should be made for this offender’s efforts to advance the administration of justice as exemplified in his plea. Cooperation with law enforcement authorities: 54 The offender was stopped at the airport. His luggage was searched. He cooperated with law enforcement officers, whilst they lawfully apprehended and searched his bags. He answered their initial questions. However, on legal advice as was his right, he declined any further opportunity to be interviewed.55 My own view of his answers to the questions asked of him is that they are most likely unreliable. In any event, they were entirely unhelpful to any further action by the investigators.56 He is not to be further punished for exercising his rights to silence or for giving unreliable answers. It is simply a case of there being no further mitigation of his sentence on that account.Character:57 The accused has not come before the law on any other prior occasion. In these sorts of cases, however, that does not attract as much mitigation of sentencing outcome as it does in other cases. But my view is that some mitigation on that account is allowable.58 As to his character, there are two references that speak of him favourably as a family man. I have already made reference to his employment history; at the time of incarceration his income stream was from unemployment benefits, as I understand it, from Centrelink. But for this offence, there is nothing to suggest that he was not other than a useful member of society, prior to August of 2005.Probable effect of sentence on family and dependents:59 There is no evidence to the likely impact that this sentence will have upon the offender’s family including his son. His son is a teenager and no doubt will miss his father and the daily paternal influence a father would supply. The offender worries about his wife. I sense some tension in the marriage related to his commission of this offence. Thus far however, it would appear his wife supports him. Obviously, she will be without her husband whilst he is in custody.Nature and severity of conditions to be imposed:60 The offender will be incarcerated in prisons where others incarcerated with him will all be male. His liberty and decision making options will be taken from him. The housing is inhospitable, bleak, severe and uncomfortable. He will be subject to prison discipline. His limited English, age and mental capacity will see him isolated from others around him. The environment in which he is housed is likely to be dangerous. The environment is not an environment fostering rehabilitation and his rehabilitation prospects. Access to family and friends is limited to scheduled visits. Rehabilitation prospects:61 But for whatever influence or impact imprisonment might have upon him, there is no reason to believe he is likely to offend in this way again. Deterrence:62 There is a real issue in this case as to the Court’s approach to deterrence. The defence’s submission is that the offender’s intellectual impairment does not make him a suitable candidate for the application of the principle of general deterrence. The case relied upon by the defence was Pham [2005] NSWCCA 314. In that case, the Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out that there were three ways in which a mental condition might mitigate a sentencing outcome: 
     
     In the assessment of the offender’s moral culpability 
     In the assessment of the offender as a vehicle for general deterrence 
     In assessing the impact of a custodial sentence upon the offender. 
    63 I have already dealt with the first and last of those. I now turn to assess him as a vehicle for general deterrence.64 I also note that in Pham, as in this case, the offender did not give evidence in support of the material contained in the psychological profile, see Qutami [2007] NSWCCA 353. On the basis, no expert witness was required for cross-examination, the Court of Criminal Appeal appeared to have taken the view it was open to the Court of first instance to rely upon the expert’s report. Again, that situation appears to be mirrored in this case. 65 My assessment has been that the intellectual capacity of the offender is not as minimal as Ms Robilliard opines but is nonetheless significantly lower than the bulk of the general population. Against that assessment therefore, it seems to me there is scope for mitigating the sentence outcome, by mitigating to some extent the impact that general deterrence will have upon this sentence. Setting the Sentence:66 When I balance the objective criminality as I have determined it to be, against the subjective material required of me also by s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 Cwlth), I am of a view that an overall sentence of seven years imprisonment for this offence is appropriate.67 Making due allowance for the subjective matters, the minimum period that is appropriate for a non-parole period, see Power v The Queen 131 (1974) CLR 623, appears to me to be one of four years and three months. Mr Tran, would you stand up please?68 Quang Het Tran, I convict you of the offence that you, on or about 12 August 2005 at Sydney, did import into Australia, a prohibited import to which s 233B of the Customs Act (1901) apply, namely narcotic goods, consisting of a quantity of heroin being 861.1 grams which is not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin.69 I sentence you to a non-parole period of four years and three months, to date from 12 August 2005 and to expire on 11 November 2009. Your whole sentence will expire on 11 August 2012.70 Mr Tran, what all that means is this, that for reasons that I have explained in court and to the Court, you are being sentenced to a minimum period of imprisonment of four years and three months. The sentence dates from the day you first went into prison and will finish on 11 November in the year 2009. On that date, you will be eligible to be released by the prison authorities. If you are released, your parole period will not expire until 11 August 2012. HIS HONOUR; Is his release subject to a decision of the Parole Board?NICOLL: That’s my understanding, your Honour..71 Whether you are released or not, will be a matter for the Parole Board to determine. You will have to convince them that you have rehabilitated. The Parole Board will look at everything that you have done fromthe day you went into prison, to see what you have done to better yourself, and to make a judgment as to whether you are likely to re-offend if you go back into the community. This Court does not influence their decision. What is most likely to influence their decision is how well you get on with your rehabilitation in prison.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Rodney Camilleri has been indicted at the Bega District Court on a charge of dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s 52A Crimes Act 1900 NSW. He has pleaded not guilty.  
     
      
    2 The Crown seeks to tender evidence of the analysis of a sample of the respondent’s blood taken from him following the motor car accident giving rise to the charge. On 17 October 2006 the trial judge ruled that an analysis certificate, purportedly prepared pursuant to s 20 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, (“Road Transport Act”) which the Crown sought to tender in evidence, would be rejected. The issue was raised again at a pre-trial hearing on 8 February 2007 when his Honour ruled that, for the reasons he had previously given in relation to the certificate, he would not allow any evidence relating to the blood sample to be admitted. 
     
      
    3 The Crown, exercising its right of appeal pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, appeals against his Honour’s interlocutory rulings. Although the tender of the certificate is no longer pressed, it being accepted that the blood sample was not taken in accordance with s 20 of the Road and Transport Act, the Crown submits that the trial judge’s ruling in relation to the admissibility of other evidence with respect to the sample was erroneous. There is no issue but that if his Honour’s ruling is sustained the Crown case would be substantially weakened. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    4 On 31 October 2004 the respondent was drinking at a local country hotel. His wife and two children, aged 7 and 9 years were with him. The respondent and his family left the hotel at about 10.40 pm in their Landcruiser motor vehicle. The respondent was the driver. None of the passengers in the car was wearing a seatbelt. Soon after leaving the hotel the Landcruiser left the road, rolled and came to a stop. The respondent’s wife sustained fatal injuries. The children walked to the closest residence to obtain assistance. The owner of that property conveyed one child, the respondent and his wife to the Bega Hospital. The respondent’s wife was pronounced dead a short time after arrival at the hospital. 
     
      
    5 The respondent was suffering from an obvious and not insignificant laceration to his head. Although he was present at the hospital he declined any treatment. The nurse in charge of the Accident and Emergency section that night, Sister Finnerty, made observations of the respondent and spoke with him. She believed that it was her legal obligation to obtain a sample of the respondent’s blood. She informed the respondent of this and he, accepting that she was under an obligation to do so, provided a blood sample which was taken before 12.40 am. A subsequent analysis of the blood showed an alcohol reading of 0.153g of alcohol/100ml of blood. 
     
      
       
      Voir Dire 
       
      
    6 On 16 October 2006 the respondent came before the Bega District Court for trial. The trial judge was informed that the respondent objected to the tender of the blood analysis evidence because the sample was not lawfully obtained from him. 
     
      
    7 The relevant provisions for the taking of a blood sample following an accident are contained in s 20 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. That section provides that if a person attends at, or, is admitted into a hospital for examination or treatment in consequence of an accident on a road, the medical practitioner, by whom an accident patient is attended, is “under a duty to take a sample of the patient’s blood for analysis as soon as practicable” (s 20(1) and (2)). Subsection (3) provides that the medical practitioner has a duty to take the sample whether or not the accident patient consents. Subsection (4) permits a registered nurse who is attending the patient and who is accredited by the hospital to take the blood sample. 
     
      
    8 The respondent was informed by Sister Finnerty that he was required to provide a blood sample. This was not correct. Because the respondent had attended the hospital for the purpose of supporting his critically injured wife and had, neither attended for the purpose of, nor, been admitted for examination or treatment, he could not be required to give a blood sample. However, it is not suggested that in requiring the sample she acted otherwise than in good faith and out of a genuine concern that she fulfill what she understood to be her statutory obligation. 
     
      
    9 The hospital report noted that the respondent refused examination and treatment. It also noted that he “discharged” himself against advice. He confirmed this position when he gave evidence on the voir dire stating that he had attended the hospital merely for the purpose of accompanying his critically ill wife. 
     
      
    10 Sister Finnerty also contacted the police to report the incident. They attended the hospital and observed the respondent, with his son, in the emergency section of the hospital. The police inquired of Sister Finnerty if a blood sample had been taken. They were advised that it had not. Although they were entitled to request the respondent to provide a breath test, this was not done. It would seem that the police expected that a blood sample would be taken by the hospital. 
     
      
    11 There was other evidence tendered on the voir dire which indicated that the respondent had been drinking earlier in the evening of the accident. However, that evidence may not provide a firm foundation for any finding as to the extent to which the respondent was affected by alcohol. 
     
      
       
      Judgment of 17 October 2006 
       
      
    12 As I have indicated there are two relevant decisions of the trial judge. The first was delivered on 17 October 2006.  
     
      
    13 On that occasion the trial judge found that the respondent’s purpose in being at the hospital was to accompany his dying wife. Although he had suffered injury he did not attend the hospital for treatment. His Honour found that the blood was taken “through the mistaken belief by Sister Finnerty that she was required, in those circumstances, to do so. In my view, the taking of that blood, in those circumstances, was improper in that the accused had not attended the hospital for examination or treatment, but had attended to be with his, as it turned out, dying wife.” His Honour found that because it was not authorised by the Road Transport Act the taking of a blood test was a “serious invasion” of the respondent’s rights. 
     
      
    14 His Honour determined that because, in these circumstances the taking of blood was not authorised by the Road Transport Act, the certificate was not admissible pursuant to that Act. His Honour then turned to consider the provisions of s 138 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    15 That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence that was obtained:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
           
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
          
         
        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
         
         
        (2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:  
         
         
          
          (a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or 
           
          (b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission. 
          
         
         
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:  
         
         
        (a) the probative value of the evidence, and 
         
          
          (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
           
          (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 
          
         
        (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 
         
          
          (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 
           
          (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the  
          International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
          , and 
           
          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and 
           
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law. 
          
         
        Note. 
         The  
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
         is set out in Schedule 2 to the  
        Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 
         of the Commonwealth.” 
        
       
      
    16 The trial judge concluded that the analysis of the respondent’s blood was of the highest probative value. It had been taken within 2 hours of the accident and was analysed appropriately by the relevant personnel. Having regard to the provisions of s 52AA of the Crimes Act his Honour concluded that, should the analysis certificate be admitted into evidence, the respondent would be conclusively presumed to be under the influence of alcohol at the time of driving. 
     
      
    17 His Honour recognised that when the police attended at the hospital, being within 2 hours of the accident, they were entitled to administer a breath test. His Honour concluded that this is what should have been done. However, he was also satisfied that the failure to take a breath test was explained by the fact that the police believed a blood test was to be taken by the hospital. 
     
      
    18 The trial judge turned to consideration of the particular provisions of s 138(1) and (3). His Honour recognised that a balance must be struck and gave consideration to the matters he understood to be relevant to his decision. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Subsection (3)(c) is the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature to the seriousness of the offence. I have regard to the changes in public perception and changes in legislation dealing with breathalysers, the taking of breath and blood of drivers over many years. I also take into account matters under s 150AA and note that the learned author makes reference when he says: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘ALRC stated that ‘there is, for example, a greater public interest that a murderer be convicted and dealt with under the law than someone guilty of a victimless crime.’ A majority of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has held, see the Queen v Dalley (2002) 132 A Crim R 169 that ‘the public interest in the conviction and punishment of those guilty of crime is entitled to greater weight in the case of crimes of greater gravity.’ (Spigelman CJ and Blanch AJ agreeing, Simpson J dissenting). This approach was followed in R v MM [2004] NSWCCA 364. Similarly, it will be relevant that a civil, rather than a criminal, proceeding was involved and that the proceeding was brought by a party in the exercise of a statutory function.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I have regard again to the nature of the offence and the subject matter of the proceedings and the public interest in such proceedings. Subs (d) deals with the gravity or of the impropriety or contravention.” 
        
       
      
    19 His Honour concluded that Sister Finnerty was not aware that she could not carry out the blood test. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “She was under the misapprehension that the accused’s attendance at the casualty section required her to carry out the taking of the blood. If impropriety and contravention is dependant upon the understandings of Sister, it is of small value.” 
        
       
      
    20 In my opinion this conclusion was correct. However, his Honour went on to qualify the conclusion. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The difficulty, however, is that the results, because of the Sister’s misunderstanding, is of significant consequence and, in my view, blood has been taken which should not have been taken and the result being that the analysis of that blood would be available to the Crown, should the analysis be admitted into evidence.” 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour concluded that, although the Sister had acted honestly, because of her misconception her actions involved impropriety. His Honour described that impropriety as “very grave.” 
     
      
    22 His Honour then turned to consider paras (f), (g) and (h) of s 138(3). He accepted that the Sister’s actions were inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Although he did not identify the particular clause which was breached this Court has been informed that it related to the right to privacy. His Honour concluded that this breach would not assume much weight in the determination of the issue. With respect to para (g) his Honour concluded that there was no other proceeding which was likely to be taken and accordingly that consideration was irrelevant. In relation to para (h) his Honour concluded that, as was clearly the case, the police would have been able to obtain a breath analysis which would have been admissible. His Honour also had evidence before him from which he concluded that it was probable that, if a breath analysis had been taken, it would have returned a reading lower than 0.15. However, to my mind that consideration was irrelevant.  
     
      
    23 His Honour expressed his ultimate conclusion in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because of the affect of s 52AA of the  
        Crimes Act,  
        for the admission in to evidence of an analysis certificate showing a reading above .15 carries with it the onerous evidentiary consequences referred to in that section. There is significant prejudice that flows to the accused should the certificate be admitted into evidence. I find the matter difficult in the exercise of discretion in respect of the high degree of probative value, and the ultimate prejudice that flows to the accused should the certificate be admitted in the form it was. Having regard to the manner in which the blood was taken and the view to which I have come as to the impropriety involved in the taking of such blood, and in the balancing and weighing up procedures which the court must undergo in the exercise of discretion, I am of the view that the certificate should be rejected under s 138 of the  
        Evidence Act  
        and accordingly would propose to do so should the certificate be tendered at trial.” 
        
       
       
      Judgment of 8 February 2007 
       
      
    24 The trial judge was again invited to consider the matter at a pre-trial hearing on 8 February 2007. In his reasons for judgment on this occasion his Honour records the fact that a further application under s 138 was before the court. His Honour understood this to be an invitation to revisit his reasons for having rejected the blood analysis certificate and “inferentially the other evidence that may deal with the blood sample.” I understand this to be a reference to the fact that the Crown, as was submitted to this Court, accepted that for other reasons the certificate would not be admissible in evidence. However, relying on the discretion provided by s 138 to admit improperly obtained evidence the Crown wished to tender the evidence of the blood sample, its analysis, and further evidence in relation to the inference which would be available as to the blood alcohol level of the respondent at the time of the accident. 
     
      
    25 His Honour rejected the Crown’s submission. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The reasons I gave for the rejection of the evidence was in reliance upon s 138 and the exercise of my discretion on the basis of the findings that I made. It was well open to the Crown to canvass the correctness of those decisions in an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. It chose not to do so. There is no new factual matter raised in the submissions and as I have indicated, merely the failure to have regard to the decisions, (a reference to authority) those decisions may or may not affect the appropriateness of the order I made, but they are matters to be taken into account in the Court of Criminal Appeal in my view, not in a further application before this Court.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour accordingly refused the application. 
     
      
       
      Discussion 
       
      
    27 In my opinion the conclusion that the actions of Sister Finnerty involved “grave impropriety” was not open to his Honour. It could not be doubted that the taking of blood was not authorised by law and was a serious invasion of the respondent’s personal rights: see Lill v Thompson Loveday J, unreported, NSWSC 30 January 1989; (1989) 8 MVR 300 at 306 per Loveday J. 
     
      
    28 However, s 138 requires consideration not only of the effect of the action but also the motivation of the person who carries out that action. Section 138 operates in relation to evidence that was obtained improperly or in contravention of a relevant law or in consequence of an impropriety (subs (1)). Subs (3) directs the court to consider the gravity of the impropriety or contravention s 138(3)(d) and whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless s 138(3)(e). 
     
      
    29 The respondent was present in the Emergency Department of the hospital following a motor vehicle accident with obvious signs of head injury. The Sister acted in the belief that he was a patient and that she was obliged to take the blood sample. Her actions would have been lawful if, as she believed, he had attended at the hospital for treatment or examination. Notwithstanding that the taking of blood is a significant invasion of a person’s privacy, the legislature has provided that an individual’s right to privacy cannot prevail over the taking of a blood samples from accident patients. The public interest in ensuring that persons do not drive when affected by alcohol has been judged by the legislature to be greater than an individual’s right to privacy. Where, as in this case the blood sample was obtained by the sister, in the innocent, but mistaken belief, that she was obliged to obtain it, only a minimal level of impropriety was involved. 
     
      
    30 Apart from this difficulty, in my view, the trial judge’s consideration of the elements which s 138 requires to be balanced was not correct. His Honour was concerned that the admission of the evidence of the blood sample would bring considerable prejudice to the respondent. His Honour had in mind that the evidence would be likely to lead to the conclusion, as was discussed during the course of the pre-trial hearing, that the respondent would have no alternative but to plead guilty to the relevant offence. Admission of the evidence may be conclusive proof of the fact that the respondent was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the accident (s 52AA(1)). His Honour concluded that this prejudice, which was personal to the respondent, together with the level of impropriety which he identified meant that the evidence should be excluded. 
     
      
    31 In my view the approach which his Honour took was not appropriate. As Howie J made plain in R v EM (2003) NSWCCA 374 at [74]-[78] s 138 is concerned with balancing public interests. The prejudice to the individual accused, which to varying degrees must be present in every case, will rarely be material. It may be of concern if the means by which the evidence was obtained has the consequence that an accused cannot effectively respond to it. There may be other personal considerations in a particular case. However, the fundamental concern of the section is to ensure that, if the law has been breached, or some other impropriety has been involved in obtaining the evidence, this is balanced against the public interest in successfully prosecuting alleged offenders. The competing interests are obedience to the law in the gathering of evidence and enforcement of the law in respect of offenders. In R v EM Howie J said at [74]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The discretion under s 138 is similar to that which was described in  
        Swaffield  
        as the public policy discretion at common law. Of course, there is a significant difference between the discretion under s 138 and that at common law: the section requires that the Crown persuade the court to admit evidence that was improperly or unlawfully obtained. But just as at common law, the public policy discretion was distinct and separate from the unfairness discretion, so the discretion to admit evidence under s 138 is a distinct and separate discretion from that arising under s 90. The two discretions may overlap but they are not synonymous. Section 138 is not, in its terms at least, concerned with the court ensuring a fair trial for the accused. Certainly that is not a paramount consideration when exercising the discretion. The discretion exercised under s 138(1) seeks to balance two competing public interests, neither of which directly involves securing a fair trial for the accused.” 
        
       
      
    32 There can be no doubt that, if the Crown can prove the taking of the blood sample, analysis of that sample showing a reading in excess of 0.15 and evidence that this reading may prove the blood alcohol level of the respondent at the time of the accident, the evidence will have significant probative value in this trial. The evidence may be the foundation of the Crown case.  
     
      
    33 However, the offence with which the respondent is charged is serious (see s 138(3)(c)), involving as it does the loss of life of another. It carries a maximum prison term of ten years. The measure of the public interest in the conviction of an offender is greater in relation to serious crimes: R v Dalley (2002) 132 A Crim R 169 at [3], [7]. 
     
      
    34 In these circumstances, in my view, the balance which s 138 requires to be struck inevitably leads to the conclusion that, if otherwise admissible, evidence of the blood alcohol level of the respondent at the time of the accident obtained from the blood sample taken by Sister Finnerty should be admitted into evidence.  
     
      
    35 This case is to be distinguished from a situation where evidence is obtained by police in knowing breach of the law or, where they may be reckless as to whether or not it has been lawfully obtained. Where the breach of the law is innocent, and the alleged offence serious there must be powerful countervailing considerations before the evidence should be rejected. The fact that the evidence is of high probative value will weigh in favour of its admission. 
     
      
    36 For these reasons, in my opinion, insofar as the Crown appeals an interlocutory ruling of his Honour rejecting evidence of the blood sample and its alcohol content pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act, the Crown appeal should be upheld. In coming to my conclusion I have assumed that the evidence, if admitted would be probative of the blood alcohol level of the respondent at the relevant time. It will be a matter for the trial judge to consider whether, for reasons other than the improper taking of the blood sample, the evidence should be admitted. 
     
      
    37 For these reasons, in my opinion, the appropriate orders are: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      2. The order of McLoughlin DCJ rejecting evidence relating to the blood sample is quashed. 
       
      
    38 BELL J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    39 HOWIE J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

   DECISION: 
   (1) Appeal allowed with costs.; (2) Set aside the determinations of the Jury on Questions 2, 5(c) and 7 and order a new trial of Questions 2, 3, 4, 5(c), 6(c), 7 and 8. 
   
   
    
    
    
   
  
 
 
  
   
    
   CATCHWORDS: 
   DEFAMATION – Jury determinations under s.7A(3) – A series of three articles in Daily Telegraph related to Acclaim Education, a college with conduct of which the appellant was associated which coached HSC students – many references to fraud, cheating, investigations and scandal – First article did not name appellant, later articles identified her by name, photographs and adverse personal history as the person referred to – Jury answered questions on whether readers of first article identified her (yes) whether it was reasonable to identify her (no), answered questions on whether imputations relating to history were conveyed in second and third articles (no). Jury found that another imputation which did not relate to the College was conveyed and was defamatory (convicted of bank robberies). The C.A. set aside three determinations that imputations were not conveyed and ordered new trial on those imputations and whether they were defamatory, and refused to set aside two other challenged determinations: decision turned on detailed address to contents of articles. Consideration of – appellate power to set aside jury verdict – proof that identification by reader is reasonable where the person referred to is not named and identification depends on reader’s special knowledge or on reader’s interpretation after seeing identification in later publication – Held if it is incontrovertible from later publication that identification was correct, that fact predominates in assessing whether it was reasonable to make the identification.

    1 MASON P: I agree with Bryson JA. 
     
      
    2 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Bryson JA. 
     
      
    3 BRYSON JA: The appellant, who was the plaintiff in the Common Law Division, appeals pursuant to s.102 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 from some of the answers given by the jury in their determination under s.7A(3) of the Defamation Act 1974. Her claims were based on a series of three articles published in the Daily Telegraph on Monday 20 and on 21 and 22 June 2005. The proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 24 June 2005. The trial under s.7A took place before Howie J and a jury on Tuesday 14 and on 15 and 16 February 2006. Statements in the articles which are not contentious show that the appellant was a teacher of English at Homebush Boys High School and that she tutored at and was in some way involved in the conduct of Acclaim Education, a tutoring college at Homebush, where students were tutored for the Higher School Certificate examination in English.  
     
      
    4 The first matter complained of is the leading article on the front page of the Daily Telegraph for 20 June 2005, which is continued on page 4. The article is headed “HSC FOR SALE”. This article included these passages (and I use paragraph numbers which did not appear in the article but were attributed to them by counsel). 
     
      
       
        
        1. HSC FOR SALE 
         
        2.  
        Students buying top marks from tutor cheats 
         
        3. HUNDREDS of children have been able to buy their way into university in a cash-for-coursework scam being run by a Sydney teacher. 
         
        4. The  
        Daily Telegraph 
         can reveal a teacher from a state-run high school has been earning up to $5000 a subject to do school work for pupils. 
         
        5. The teacher’s company is accused of faking work to help more than 250 pupils win university places. 
         
        6. In one case, the agency took two pages of rough notes written by a Year 12 pupil and converted them into a 32-page novelette, which got 48 marks out of 50. 
         
        7. In another, the agency wrote four poems from scratch and gave them to a pupil to enable her to get the UAI grades she needed to get into university. 
         
        8. The teacher or her agency is not registered with any tutoring organisation so is not subject to any controls or checking. 
         
        9. The HSC examination is split into two elements: coursework and assessments that make up 50 per cent, and an exam which constitutes the remainder. 
         
        10. The BMW-driving teacher is paid up to $5000 a subject to cheat on the coursework requirements. 
        
       
      
    5 Later passages include:  
     
      
       
        
        22. Ethical tutoring agencies, many of which are registered with the Australian Tutoring Authority, would offer additional teaching to help them improve their work. 
         
        23. This particular agency, however, took the draft and reworked it themselves, cheating the system. 
         
        … 
         
        28. The owner of the tutoring agency claimed last night the allegations were false.  
         
        29. She said the agency was bound by a code of conduct that required students to do their own work. 
         
        30. “This is the first I have heard of it,” she said. 
         
        31. “It is absolutely untrue. We have codes of conduct and making kids do their own work is in that.” 
        
       
      
    6 A break-out in the article is headed “Project a true work of fiction”:  
     
      
       
        
        33. THE year 12 pupil from a school in Sydney’s inner-west had already achieved success in English but wanted to push up the bar. 
         
        34. The girl and her parents explained to the agency she had already passed three-unit English but wanted to go one better. 
         
        35. Passing four-unit English was the pinnacle but the centrepiece involved a huge project of creative writing – an 8000-word novelette. 
         
        36. Part of the test was to conduct research to support the writing and to keep a log book. 
         
        37. This she had done but when it came to writing her novelette, her inspiration dried up after eight lacklustre paragraphs. 
         
        38. Her tutor joined her in a brainstorming session where they worked out plot and how the characters would develop. All that was left was to cheat. 
         
        39. After the pupil left, the agency’s boss penned the story based on the brainstorming. 
         
        40. The 32-page paper was then tendered as the pupil’s own work and it achieved 48 marks out of 50. 
         
        41. The agency charged for almost 50 hours of work at $60-an-hour. 
        
       
      
    7 On page 4 para 11 there is a photograph with the caption “Out of school … a boy enters the home of the teacher/tutor”. The photograph shows a street scene in front of a suburban house, and there is an unidentifiable boy carrying a satchel walking on the pavement, a black BMW car in the foreground right and a paperbark tree in the centre foreground. In the middle ground are fences and vegetation. 
     
      
    8 The article did not name the appellant, or identify her by reference to a photograph or an address. The “state-run high school” referred to in para 4 was not identified in this article. 
     
      
    9 The second matter complained of is the leading article on the front page of the Daily Telegraph for the following day 21 June 2005. The article is headed “CHEAT SHEET 261 students under investigation in HSC cash for uni scandal” and continues on page 3 under the headline “Teacher was a bank robber.” In this article the appellant was named several times; there is a photograph of her and there is no photograph which could possibly show anyone else, and there is a greatly reduced photograph of the front page from the previous day. The article includes these passages on page 1:  
     
      
       
        
        5. Meanwhile, the teacher at the centre of the cash-for-coursework scam was yesterday uncovered as former bank robber, now Sydney tutor, Rachel Gardener. 
         
        6. The probe was prompted by a  
        Daily Telegraph  
        investigation into a Sydney tutoring college, which took up to $5000 per subject to do HSC coursework. 
         
        7. Acclaim Education in Homebush is run by Ms Gardener, 53, who has been on unpaid leave since the start of the year from her job teaching English at Homebush Boys High. 
         
        8. She denies claims from a former employee that she and other Acclaim staff doctored work for students to help them attain higher marks. 
         
        9. “This is the first I have heard of it,” Ms Gardener said. “It is absolutely untrue. We have codes of conduct and making kids do their own work is in that.” 
        
       
      
    10 Under a heading “STUDY SCAM” on page 1 are several passages including: 
     
      
       
        
        15. 
         ■ Teacher 
         at the centre of the controversy uncovered as a former bank robber 
        
       
      
    11 Under a heading “Cheat sheet checks From Page 1”, passages on page 3 include:  
     
      
       
        
        22. The whistleblower, who worked for Acclaim for two years, told  
        The Daily Telegraph 
        : “You can literally buy your child into university. It is unethical. 
         
        23. I knew what I was doing. I was so well trained in it, it was a cut and paste job in some cases.” 
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        26. Opposition education spokeswoman Jillian Skinner called for the teacher concerned to be sacked. 
         
          
         
        27. “This is cheating. I am really surprised a teacher would do this,” she said. 
         
        28. Mohan Dhall, from the Australian Tutoring Association, said most tutors did the right thing. 
         
        29. “The fraudulent behaviour of some brings the whole sector into disrepute,” he said. 
         
        30. “Good tutors don’t cheat. It is incredibly unfair that some do, costing other students a university place. 
        
       
      
    12 Under the main heading “Teacher was a bank robber By RICKY SUTTON” on page 3 are these passages: 
     
      
       
        
        37. THE teacher behind the cash-for-coursework scandal rocking Sydney’s education system once spent eight months in jail for a series of bank heists. 
         
        38. Homebush Boys English teacher Rachel Gardener was one of a seven-strong team busted after a series of raids in Paris, France, in the late 1970s. 
         
        39. She was sentenced to time served – meaning she was free to go as she had spent eight months in a jail in Fleury prior to the trial. 
         
        40. Ms Gardener last night denied helping students cheat on their HSCs. 
         
        41. “Once or twice a year I get a ratbag parent. Some do the wrong thing,” she said. “I ask them to leave the centre.” 
         
        42. She then confessed she had been to jail. 
         
        43. “It was about 30 years ago in France. I don’t want to talk about it,” she said. 
        
       
      
    13 The article goes on to give an account of events in France in 1979 in which the appellant was a member of an English-Australian gang arrested and imprisoned for obtaining money from banks by deception. The article continues: 
     
      
       
        
        55. Almost 26 years later, Ms Gardener has reinvented herself in Sydney. She has worked at Homebush High School since the late 1990s and started Acclaim Education two years ago. 
        
       
      
    14 Also on page 3, a photograph of the appellant is captioned 
     
      
       
        
        56. Colourful past…accused HSC cheat Rachel Gardener. 
        
       
      
     A small reproduction of the previous day’s headline is captioned 
     
      
       
        
        57. Outrage…how we broke the scandal story yesterday. 
        
       
      
    15 Passages of comment by Maralyn Parker include: 
     
      
       
        
        58. 
         Devastating for the honest students 
         
          
        COMMENT  
         
         BY MARALYN PARKER 
         
        … 
         
         
        62. That they were competing with cheats is devastating. I want the cheats caught and punished. 
         
        63. But most of all I want the person who set up such a blatant method of cheating to be made accountable for the harm she has done. 
         
        64. Not only has she messed with the education of countless children who submitted work that was not theirs, she has cheated those who should have won places at university in the first place. 
        
       
      
    16 The third matter complained of an article in the Daily Telegraph published on 22 June 2005 on page 11 and comment headed ""Education” on page 21. After stating to the effect that more than 400 children had been caught cheating on their HSCs in the past three years, and making further statements about the subject attributed to the Board of Studies, this article includes these passages: 
     
      
       
        
        9. The HSC results of 261 Sydney students are being reviewed by the board in the largest investigation into cheating in NSW. 
         
        10. It follows claims from a worker at Homebush tutoring college, Acclaim Education, parents were able to pay for coursework to get children better grades for university. 
        
       
      
    17 A breakout on page 11 says:  
     
      
       
        
        17.  
        Marked Improvement 
         
        18. How Acclaim Education improved a student’s writing:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (and an example was given) 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        19. □ Before: Esther collected small manageable bits of wood with care. Her arms ached but she knew it would soon be dark. 
         
        20. □ After: Evie collected small bits of gnarled branches with care. She was always careful when gathering the deadfall from the trees to use as fuel. Her arms ached with the load and the tension her cautious approach created. 
        
       
      
    18 The article on page 11 concludes: 
     
      
       
        
        22. Do you have any information about cheating in the HSC? 
        
       
      
    19 The reader is referred to page 21, where there is a photograph of the appellant over the caption “60. Scandal … Rachel Gardener, the teacher accused of taking cash for HSC work”. All the material on page 21 appears under the by-line “Maralyn Parker” (with her photograph) and this no doubt explains expression in the first person. Comment by Maralyn Parker includes:  
     
      
       
        
         
        27. In fact, she was lucky. Any student whose name appears on the list given to the Board of Studies (from those helped by Acclaim College) who is found to have cheated will now pay a much more onerous price than just failing in one assignment. 
         
        … 
         
         
        35. Yes, it would be tempting to pay for a higher mark, the HSC in this state is so high stakes. But the sad thing is many of the children who have benefited from this scam may well have been able to improve their results if they had been ethically tutored. 
         
        … 
         
         
        42. I would love to see a list of the names of these corrupt tutors posted on the ATA website for all to see. 
         
        43. Hopefully the NSW Board of Studies and the ATA will explore all possibilities of having them charged. 
         
        44. Vital lesson to learn from the scandal.  
         
        … 
         
         
        49. While attempts to cheat during actual exams are still occurring, in this case all the cheating happened in projects done outside school time.  
         
        … 
         
         
        58. However, I would like to see this particular case studied by all HSC markers so they can see how corrupt tutors can collude with students and parents to cheat. 
        
       
      
    20 The imputations alleged and the Questions for the Jury were set out in Exhibit E (CB 161-164). The determinations which the jury made are shown by the circles around some of the answers: where there is no circle it was unnecessary to answer the question. The alterations to Questions 9 and 10 were made before Exhibit E went to the jury.

        Note: if you have answered ""no"" to question 9, go no further. 
         
         
        10. If you answered ""yes"" to question 9, has the Plaintiff established that the third matter complained of was published to at least one person who knew that on or about 22 June 2005 she was the controlling mind and will of Acclaim Education Pty Ltd, the operator of Acclaim College?

        Note: if you have answered ""no"" to question 10, go no further. 
         
         
        11. If you answered ""yes"" to question 10, has the plaintiff established that the third matter complained of conveyed to the ordinary reasonable reader the following imputation (or any imputation not different in substance)? 
         
         
          
          (a) The Plaintiff operated a tutoring business that engaged in fraud. 
           
            
             
              
               
                
                Yes / No 
                 
                  
                   
                    
                   
                  
                 
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        12. If you answered ""yes"" to question 11 (a) has the Plaintiff established that any such imputation was defamatory of her? 
         
         
          
          (a) The Plaintiff operated a tutoring business that engaged in fraud. 
           
            
             
              
               
                
                Yes / No 
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    21 In her Amended Notice of Appeal of 9 June 2006 the appellant gave her grounds for challenging answers to Questions 2, 5(a), 5(b), 5(c) and 7(a). She claimed a new trial on the issue of identification in Question 2 and the imputations alleged in the first article: that is, on all of Questions 3 and 4. She claimed a new trial on Questions 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) and 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) which are the imputations alleged in the second article on which the jury found against her: the other one was found for her. She claimed a new trial on one of the imputations alleged in the third article, dealt with in Questions 7(a) and 8(a): and did not challenge the answer to Question 9 or seek further trial of Questions 10, 11 or 12. 22 In the Amended Notice of Appeal the appellant claimed among other things an order that Question 2 be answered in the affirmative. Argument on appeal established that the appellant pursued the alternative claim in the Amended Notice of Appeal for a new trial on the issue of identification in Question 2. It was not contended by either party that a general new trial was called for in any circumstances. 
     
      
    23 The grounds on which the Court of Appeal may set aside a determination by a jury are limited. In Calin v The Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd (1991) 173 CLR 33 at 41-42 Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and McHugh JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        The correct principle is that a court on appeal may order a new trial if the jury has reached a conclusion which is against the evidence in the sense that the evidence  
        in its totality  
        preponderates so strongly against the conclusion favoured by the jury that it can be said that the verdict is such as reasonable jurors could not reach. 
         
         
        Authority in this Court and in other jurisdictions supports the appellant's submission: 
        Hocking v Bell 
         (1945), 71 CLR 430, at pp 440, 442, per Latham CJ; p 468; per Rich J; p 487, per Starke J; p 499, per Dixon J;  
        Brooker v Roszykiewcz 
         (1963), 37 ALJR 246, at p 248, per Kitto J; p 250, per Taylor J; p 251, per Menzies J;  
        Jones v Spencer 
         (1897), 77 LT 536;  
        Metropolitan Railway Co v Wright 
         (1886), 11 App Cas 152;  
        Phillips v Martin 
         (1890), 15 App Cas 193. It should be noted that, in  
        Hocking v Bell 
        , Dixon J drew a distinction between cases, on the one hand, in which the verdict is vitiated by some legal error, such as material misdirection or misreception of evidence, or was perverse in the sense that the jury disregarded the judge's direction and, on the other hand, cases where, on conflicting evidence, a verdict is found which is said to be against the weight of evidence: (1945) 71 CLR, at p 499. In the cases last mentioned, as Starke J noted, ""the verdict is not disturbed unless the jury, viewing  
        the whole evidence 
         reasonably, could not properly find it"" (emphasis added): (1945) 71 CLR, at p487. The party seeking a new trial on this ground needs an exceptionally strong case because it must be shown that ""the evidence so preponderates against the verdict as to show that it was unreasonable and unjust"":  
        Metropolitan Railway Co v Wright 
         (1886), 11 App Cas, at p 155.  
        
       
      
    24 The High Court in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin (2003) 77 ALJR 1657 made statements of the test on appeals in the context of jury determinations under s.7A; these were collected in Gacic v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 175 by Beazley JA at [53]. Justice Beazley gave this resolution of their effect: 
     
      
       
        
        Thus, an appellate court will only interfere with a jury verdict if it is one that no reasonable jury, properly directed, could have given. 
        
       
      
    25 The appellate power over jury verdicts was extensively considered in Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 by Hunt AJA. In Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213 at [17], [22] McColl JA reviewed and stated the effect of John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin and other authorities which now govern the test for appellate intervention. As her Honour there showed, there is a need for restraint on the part of the appellate court but it is wrong to clutch at straws in defence of a verdict. See too Gacic v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd at [53] (Beazley JA).26 The test has been stated in a number of ways but in my understanding it is sufficient to say that a determination under s.7A is only to be set aside if it is a determination which reasonable people, properly directed as to the law and acting on the evidence in accordance with the law, could not find. Juries, not judges, determine the meaning and effect of matter alleged to be defamatory, whether the matter is written or spoken. This continues an allocation of responsibilities now centuries old and of constitutional significance, and leaves to the jury the function ""… to determine whether the matter complained of carries the imputation and, if it does, whether the imputation is defamatory"" which s.7A(3) gives to them.  
     
      
    27 As several of the Questions were determined favourably to the appellant it can be taken that the jury did not act with studied perversity so as to answer adversely to the appellant without real consideration. The jury’s determinations were not perverse in the sense that the jury disregarded the judge’s directions, a sense spoken of in Hocking v Bell (1945) 71 CLR 430 at 499 by Dixon J. It remains open for consideration whether each adverse answer could have a reasonable basis. 
     
      
    28 A line of decisions commencing with Charlwood Industries Pty Ltd v Brent [2002] NSWCA 201 and reviewed in Gacic v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd by Beazley JA at [50]-[70] supports the view that the Court of Appeal may itself enter a verdict where an imputation is plainly defamatory, in so doing setting aside a determination under s.7A. The High Court of Australia granted special leave to appeal against this Court’s decision in Gacic v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd on 8 December 2006. It might be thought that the reasoning which supports disposition by the Court of Appeal of the question whether matter was defamatory also supports disposition by the Court of the question whether an imputation was plainly conveyed; but this is not authoritatively supported by a decision in which the Court of Appeal has done so; see Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd. Senior Counsel for the appellant did not ask the Court of Appeal itself to enter a verdict, but pursued the alternative ground of appeal which claimed a new trial.29 Senior Counsel for the appellant referred to a passage in the judgment of Else-Mitchell J in Carr Shipping and Trading Co Pty Ltd v Sydney City Council (1963) 80 WN (NSW) 397 at 404 where among other things Else-Mitchell J said: 
     
      
       
        
        But it is not a ground for setting aside a verdict that the jury have reached a conclusion which this court regards as illogical, unsatisfactory or different from that which it would itself have reached. 
        
       
      
    30 Senior counsel pointed particularly to the reference to “a conclusion which this Court regards as illogical”. Justice Else-Mitchell was dealing with the practice and statute law of 1963, including s.160 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1899 which stated the powers of the Supreme Court in Banco to set aside a verdict in terms of the practice and using the language of that time; both now obsolete and not reproduced in the language of s.102 of the Supreme Court Act. With respect, I do not think that Else-Mitchell J’s reference to a conclusion which the court regards as illogical was happily expressed, or was intended to be a complete exposition of the part played by logic in review of jury verdicts. It would usually be the case that if a verdict was not available in logic it was unreasonable and should be set aside; but logic is not always of much use in the interpretative exercise required for a jury determination under s.7A relating to whether an imputation is conveyed and whether it is defamatory. Whether an imputation is conveyed by a publication is essentially a matter of impression — see Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd at [23] and [24] (McColl JA) – and logic does not govern decision. In my view this passage from Carr Shipping and Trading Co Pty Ltd v Sydney City Council does not have a place in the case law relevant to appellate control over determinations under s.7A. There are more recent expositions, of higher authority and better considered. 
     
      
    31 Two witnesses gave evidence dealing with the identification of the appellant in the first matter complained of. Mr R. J. Sinclair gave evidence that he purchased the Daily Telegraph with the article printed on 20 June 2005 and read it. His evidence to the effect that he identified the article as referring to the appellant was (CB 22): 
     
      
       
        
        A. That was, well, Acclaim Education or, as we call it, Rachel’s place. One of my children was going there.  
        
       
      
    32 He said he identified the article as referring to someone in particular “Mainly due to the photograph” and he understood the article to refer to “Rachel, the owner of the business” whose full name was “Rachel Gardener, I think”.  
     
      
    33 His evidence continued (CB 22): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. What made you think that this article referred to Rachel Gardener? 
         
        A. Well, there was a couple of things. It mentioned the fact that the BMW-driving teacher, and then I looked at the photo and the streetscape is how that street appears with the car in question and the paperbark trees in the street and the, like, picket fence. 
         
         
        Q. So you are aware – 
         
         
        OBJECTION. LEADING. 
         
          
         
        Q. What sort of motor vehicle does Rachel Gardener drive, to your knowledge? 
         
        A. It was a black BMW. 
         
         
        Q. How do you come to identify the scene in – you are referring here to the photograph on what is page 4 where it says, “Out of school…a boy enters the home of the teacher/tutor”. How do you identify that scene? When have you seen that scene before? 
         
        A. It is the way the street appears where the tutoring place is. 
         
         
        Q. When have you been in that street? 
         
        A. Just to drop off and pick up my son while he is attending the tutoring. 
         
         
        Q. So how long did your son attend tutoring at those premises? 
         
        A. Approximately 18 months, I think. 
         
         
        Q. How often would you drop him off there? 
        
       
       A. Once a week. Not every week, but almost once a week. 
       
      
    34 Cross-examination established to the effect (CB 28) that Mr Sinclair had seen the rear of other BMW cars which answered the description of what was seen in the photograph, that this is nothing unusual or uncommon and he has seen the BMW logo a lot of times before. Cross-examination also established (CB 29) that Mr Sinclair had seen a great many picket fences and a great many paperbark trees. 
     
      
    35 Cross-examination on these subjects concluded (CB 29):  
     
      
       
        
        Q. I mean look at this photograph, that is a suburban scene, can I suggest to you, that could be any number of hundreds or thousands of places in Sydney? 
         
        A. It could be. 
        
       
      
    36 Mr Sinclair when later recalled said to the effect that he saw the later two articles on the days they were published. 
     
      
    37 Mr G. J. Williamson gave evidence to the effect that he met the appellant Rachel Gardener in the middle of 2005 when he enrolled his son at the college. He saw her take classes. He paid fees, sometimes by cash, sometimes by cheque made out to Acclaim College which he gave to the appellant most of the time, or to staff. His evidence also showed that on the date of publication of the article, after another person had brought the article to his attention, he bought a copy of the Daily Telegraph, glanced through the article including page 4, identified the college and associated it with the appellant Rachel Gardener. His evidence was (CB 33):  
     
      
       
        
        Q. Can you tell us what made you associate this article with Rachel Gardener? 
         
        A. Just where the photo was, the BMW in the driveway, the streetscape. I parked out there several times over a few months. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So when had you parked outside the college? 
         
        A. Every Saturday afternoon for several months. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How long would you be parked on each occasion? 
         
        A. About an hour. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So I understand you to be saying, do I, that you parked there, you stayed there for an hour, or you went away? 
         
        A. Yes, I went inside the college sometimes and sometimes went back out to the car while the tutoring was on. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you waited? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And this had gone on for some months? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Looking at that photograph, do you recognise that scene? Do you say you recognise that scene as being the front of Acclaim College? 
        
       
       
        
        OBJECTION. LEADING. QUESTION WITHDRAWN. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What does that photograph depict, do you think, Mr Williamson? 
         
        A. With the article I assumed that it was Acclaim College because of the fence and her car was always parked in the driveway, the BMW. I assume it is her car. I'm not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You cannot be sure it is her car? 
         
        A. No, but it was always there, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did you recognise the boy in the picture? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you recognise the tree in the picture? 
         
        A. There's several trees in the street, yes, but yes, I stood there many a time and had a cigarette while I was waiting, yes. 
        
       
      
    38 Mr. Williamson was cross-examined on how often he had attended at the college and on the basis of his assuming that the BMW car in the photograph was the appellant's car, and also said in cross-examination (CB 35): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. I think you said that it suggested the college to you because of the streetscape, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You are not really able to say, to really be any more explicit than that? 
         
        A. No. It just looked familiar. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well, can I just suggest this to you, that it is really a scene that it could be just about anywhere in suburban Sydney, couldn't it, paperbark tree, green picket fence? 
         
        A. I am not disputing that, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You are not saying it is the only paperbark tree outside a green picket fence in Sydney, are you? 
         
        A. No, I am not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It is possible, isn’t it, that in fact the scene you see in that photograph could be at some other address and not the address of the Acclaim College where you took your son? 
         
        A. It is possible. 
        
       
      
    39 It is altogether incontrovertible that the appellant was the person referred to in the first article; this is incontrovertible because the respondent published the second article the following day, referred back to the first article expressly and proclaimed the identification with references to the appellant’s name and with her photograph. The form of Questions 1 and 2 left it open to the jury to base an affirmative answer to Question 1 upon a finding that the appellant was identified by Mr Sinclair, or by Mr Williamson, or by both of them; or possibly by neither of them but by some unidentified person or persons whose existence is established by inference; or by all these processes. These lines of reasoning were left to the jury in the trial judge's directions, and the jury was not called on by the terms of the Questions to indicate the particular line or lines of reasoning which they adopted. Clearly in answering Question 1 they adopted some one or more of these possible lines of reasoning.  
     
      
    40 The terms of Question 1 invoke the burden which lay on the appellant of proving that readers of the first article identified her as the person referred to; in strictness, the tort is proved if only one person did so, and the terms of Question 1 reflect the strict position. Two witnesses called at the trial gave oral evidence directed to establishing that each of them knew the appellant and identified her as the person referred to in the first article; and dealt, in evidence and in cross-examination, with the facts and circumstances which relate to this identification. The cross-examination of these witnesses did not extend to suggesting that they have not in fact made the identification which they claimed to have made. (They did not say that they identified the appellant as the person spoken of in the first article by reference back from the second article, in which she was clearly identified: Senior Counsel for the respondent spoke of the absence of such evidence as if it were a material omission and a matter of complaint, but there is no substance in this.) When addressing Question 2 it was for the jury to decide, in the case of each of these witnesses, whether the facts and circumstances that the witness referred to were such that it was reasonable for the witness to make the identification. The evidence relevant to decision on Question 2 was not limited to the facts and circumstances which each witnesses mentioned. Decision on whether their identifications were reasonable was also affected by and in my view on any reasonable approach was overwhelmingly dominated by the incontrovertible fact that identification of the appellant as the person referred to was correct.  
     
      
    41 Another line of reasoning put before the jury in relation to Questions 1 and 2 related to inference based on the probabilities about whether the appellant was identified by at least one person who read the first article, and whether that identification was reasonable, and on inference from the notorious fact that the Daily Telegraph is a daily newspaper of very wide circulation, particularly in the suburbs of Sydney including Homebush. Circumstances furnished a strong basis on which the jury could infer that some person or more than one existed, who read the Daily Telegraph of 20 June 2005, and knew sufficient circumstances relating to the appellant, the Acclaim College, tutoring HSC students and events in Homebush to make the identification. The material upon which the inference could be made is very strong; but it was for the jury to decide whether they should make it. The grounds available for such a finding are even stronger when it is accepted that an identification by a reader is sufficient if the reader made it on reading the second article, recollecting the first article and understanding that the appellant was the person referred to in the first article. When regard is paid to the nature of the appellant’s activity in conducting the coaching college, and to the circulation of the newspaper, the probability that one or more persons saw the first article and identified her from knowledge of facts and circumstances relating to her, and also the probability that one or more persons saw the first article and came to identify her with knowledge based on seeing the identification of her in the second article the following day, perhaps with other special knowledge, are each extremely high. 
     
      
    42 It cannot be known which line of reasoning led the jury to answer Question 1 affirmatively. They may have decided that one or other or both of the witnesses actually had made the identification of which each witness spoke; they may have rejected one or both of them but based their affirmative answer on more general reasoning about the probabilities of the appellant’s having been identified by some of the Daily Telegraph’s readership; they may have accepted all available supporting lines. Questions 1 and 2, which were adopted early in the hearing, are not expressed in terms which would expose which line of reasoning the jury adopted; and it was not necessary to frame the question in more detail than it was framed. Because of the form of Questions 1 and 2 it is for the appellant to show on appeal that the jury’s negative answer to Question 2 was not reasonably available in any of the lines of reasoning by which they may have arrived at a positive answer to Question 1. 
     
      
    43 Although there was some discussion during argument of the appeal about whether it was appropriate to divide Questions 1 and 2 or to roll up their subject matter in one question, the adoption of separate questions is not the subject of any ground of appeal. The reason for asking Question 2 as well as Question 1, and for treating them as two questions dealing with different subjects, rather than rolling them up in one question to the jury, can be understood from the masterly and influential judgment of Samuels JA in Steele v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1974] 2 NSWLR 348. Justice Samuels at 371 referred to authorities which showed that identification, publication of and concerning the plaintiff, was an essential element in the cause of action, and referred particularly to David Syme & Co. v. Canavan (1918) 25 CLR 234 at 238 per Isaacs J: “The test of whether words that do not specifically name the plaintiff refer to him or not is this: Are they such as reasonably in the circumstances would lead persons acquainted with the plaintiff to believe that he was the person referred to?” Steele related to an allegedly defamatory newspaper article which did not name or describe any person. Literally the first article falls within Isaacs J’s reference to whether words that do not specifically name the plaintiff refer to him or not.  
     
      
    44 Justice Samuels referred to Morgan v Odhams Press Ltd [1971] 1 WLR 1239 and other authority which showed that the reasoning which produces an identification in the mind of the reader does not need to be clear or precise; it can be well short of intractable. Justice Samuels said (372F):  
     
      
       
        
        Their Lordships in  
        Morgan's 
         case ([1971] 1 W.L.R. 1239;[1971] 2 All E.R. 1156) then went on to indicate the manner in which the ordinary sensible reader must be supposed to read the material from which the identification of a plaintiff may be inferred in such cases as this. First, he may be permitted to draw “rather far-fetched inferences” (per Lord Reid [1971] 1 W.L.R. 1239, at p. 1244; [1971] 2 All E.R. 1156, at p. 1162 citing  
        Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspapers Ltd. 
         [1929] 2 K.B. 33 and  
        Hough v. London Express Newspapers Ltd. 
         [1940] 2 K.B. 507) and is prone to engage in “a certain amount of loose thinking” (per Lord Reid [1971] 1 W.L.R. 1239, at p. 1245; [1971] 2 All E.R. 1156, at p. 1163); secondly, “the average reader does not read a sensational article with cautious and critical analytical care” (per Lord Morris [1971] 1 W.L.R. 1239, at p. 1254; [1971] 2 All E.R. 1156, at p. 1170), and the article here in question may properly be regarded as “sensational”. Thirdly, it must be assumed that he may read the article “casually and not expecting a high degree of accuracy” (per Lord Pearson [1971] 1 W.L.R. 1239, at p. 1270; [1971] 2 All E.R. 1156, at p. 1184).  
        
       
       
        
        It is evident that what is primarily in issue is the reasonableness of the conclusion to which the reader comes, rather than his possession a priori of the attributes employed to define him. To speak of a reasonable inference drawn by a reasonable reader may be circuitous since the impression made by the article tends to establish the nature of the qualities brought to its scrutiny. If there are no rational grounds for the inference sought to be pressed, then, ex hypothesi, the reader did not, on the relevant occasion, muster the attributes which he was bound to bring to his hypothetical task. But it may be, as Lord Donovan said in his dissenting speech ([1971] 1 W.L.R. 1239, at p. 1264; [1971] 2 All E.R. 1156, at p. 1179) that the requirement that the article must convey a defamatory meaning concerning the plaintiff to a reasonable person possessed of knowledge of the extrinsic facts postulates “… not merely a reasonable person but also a reasonable conclusion”.  
        
       
       
        
        With these principles in mind, it becomes possible to set out with some precision the criteria which must be satisfied if the plaintiff is to get to the jury. First, there must be evidence capable of satisfying the jury that persons with particular knowledge of the plaintiff believed that the article referred to her. 
        
       
      
    45 Justice Samuels went on to refer to case law dealing with the manner of proof of that fact, which can be proved either by showing that there are people with knowledge of special facts or by calling persons to show their knowledge and their understanding of the publication. Justice Samuels went on at 374:  
     
      
       
        
        Secondly, there must be evidence capable of satisfying the jury that the witnesses did possess the particular knowledge of the plaintiff which enabled them to make the identification they asserted: and, thirdly, that those who did identify the plaintiff were ordinary sensible readers. I have already expressed some doubt whether this last matter constitutes an independent ingredient: but I will assume that it does. 
         
         
        Finally, there must be evidence capable of satisfying the jury that those with particular knowledge of the plaintiff who, as ordinary sensible readers read the article with the degree of latitude permitted, and who honestly identified the plaintiff as the person referred to, could reasonably come to that conclusion. 
        
       
      
    46 Any purpose for establishing that the identification was reasonable which can be identified from the reasoning of Samuels JA is well satisfied if it is shown that the identification was correct. Justice Samuels’ observations are of course directed to the facts then before the Court of Appeal, in which the newspaper article did not name the plaintiff and any identification of the plaintiff depended only on knowledge of circumstances relevant to him, and on inference from that knowledge and from the contents of the article. Justice Samuels did not address circumstances like the present where there is evidence, outside the terms of the first article namely in the second article in which the respondent establishes and indeed proclaims the identification of the person referred to as the appellant. Nor did Isaacs J in David Syme v Canavan. It was not disputed that the identification proclaimed in the second article can come under consideration in deciding whether some member or members of the unascertained readership probably identified the appellant as the person referred to in the first article; that it is open to inference that they did so with the aid of seeing the second article the following day or later and came to the identifying conclusion on that basis. That line of reasoning is not available for the witnesses who gave oral evidence; they gave a different account of their process of identification.  
     
      
    47 There is in my opinion no reason in principle why, when deciding the question whether the identification made by the two witnesses was reasonable, the incontrovertible fact that the identification was correct is not relevant. That it was correct is so predominant a matter in assessing reasonableness that I find it difficult to understand why it was thought necessary to ask the jury to answer Question 2. For a schedule or check list of the elements of the cause of action, Question 2 is a relevant matter; on the facts of the present litigation I do not see how it is possible to infuse reality into the issue of reasonableness of identification of the appellant as the person referred to in the first article. The respondent itself proclaimed that she was, and this vindicates the reasonableness of the thinking of any person who had earlier come to the same conclusion on the basis of what was in the first article together with that person’s special knowledge. 
     
      
    48 Senior Counsel for the respondent observed that an identification can objectively be correct but it may be entirely unreasonable. This expresses a logical possibility; it is not appropriately related to the circumstances of the identification by the two witnesses who gave evidence, or of the group of persons identification by whom could be the subject of inference. None of these persons is in any way in the situation of having nothing at all to go on but having made a correct guess by accident.49 Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the jury might well have thought that it was highly improbable that there was a reader of both the first article and the second article who would remember back to where a particular person was referred to or the particular College was referred to; that person was not going to think “… I also remember that particular teacher was referred to in a particular college and this must be that person.” Counsel’s exploration of the way in which this issue could possibly be considered served, in my judgment, to enforce the simple unavailability to reasonable minds of the line of reasoning for which counsel so contended. 
     
      
    50 The appellant's complaint is to the effect that the jury as reasonable people could not have failed to find for the appellant on Question 2, in the circumstances of the evidence before them and particularly having regard to the answer which they had found to Question 1. Whether the evidence of Mr Sinclair, and also the evidence of Mr Williamson was to be accepted was for the jury to determine. Their evidence as recorded shows, in my opinion, a very strong case in support of identification by each witness of the appellant as the person referred to in the first matter complained of and on principally by reference to their evidence of recognition of the scene in the photograph, and supported by the evidence of knowledge of acts typical of the appellant and consistent with what the first article said. In my opinion it was within the province of the jury to decide if the evidence of either or both of them should or should not be relied on; however if the jury relied on the evidence of either or both of them to find an answer to Question 1 that the appellant was identified by at least one person who read the first matter complained of, it would, in my opinion, be irrational and perverse not to find also that the identification was reasonable. On any reasonable approach to the articles the second article establishes that the appellant indeed was the person referred to in the first article. In the presence of this incontrovertible fact there is no room, in the absence of irrationality or perversity, for reasonable people to reach the conclusion that identification of the appellant was not reasonable. If another line of reasoning is adopted, the inference that at least one person who read the first matter complained of identified the plaintiff as the person referred to in the first matter, with knowledge of circumstances referred to in the first article or with the aid of the plain information published the following day in the second article, is one which a reasonable person charged with finding facts could not resist. The Daily Telegraph is published daily; it is notorious that many thousands of copies are sold daily in Sydney and elsewhere; in all rationality, the conclusion that no person at all identified the appellant as the person referred to in the first matter when information in the second matter came to that person's knowledge cannot be reached on a reasonable basis. 
     
      
    51 In my opinion the answer given by the jury to Question 2 should be set aside and a new trial should be ordered on that question, and on Questions 3 and 4 which were not answered. 
     
      
    52 Imputations in the second article. The imputation in Question 5(a) is not directly borne out by any of the passages which I have quoted from the second article, or by any other passage. No statement to the literal effect that the appellant falsified work for HSC students there appears. There are close approaches to such a statement in para 5 – “… the teacher at the centre of the cash-for-coursework scam …”, in para 8 which refers to claims “… that she and other Acclaim staff doctored worked for students to help them attain higher marks”; para 37 “The teacher behind the cash-for-coursework scandal …” para 40 “ Ms Gardener last night denied helping students cheat on their HSCs”, the caption to the photograph ""accused HSC cheat"" and other references. In my opinion the view that the second article conveyed the imputation in Question 5(a) was reasonably available, indeed the allegation was strongly supported by a number of references in the article to cheating. However there is no plain statement that the appellant falsified work for HSC students; that is, that she did so herself. Although a determination the other way could have caused no surprise, it is not the case, in my opinion, that reasonable people deciding the facts could not come to the conclusion to which the jury came. 
     
      
    53 There are a number of passages which could be read as supporting the imputation alleged in Question 5(b); yet there is no direct and clear statement to the effect that the appellant herself obtained payments up to $5,000 per subject to perform coursework forming part of students’ HSC assessment; or that she acted corruptly in doing so, or that she intended that students would pass off her work as the students’ own work. The finding that that imputation was made is in my opinion available, and is supported, for example, by the headlines ""CHEAT SHEET” and “… HSC cash-for-uni scandal”, by reference to the appellant as ""the teacher at the centre of the cash-for-coursework scam"" to ""… a Sydney tutoring college, which took up to $5000 per subject to do HSC course work”; to the appellant’s denying “… claims from a former employee that she and other Acclaim staff doctored work for students to help them attain higher marks"" and other closely similar references to the appellant. Not all passages in the second article point to the appellant, or point solely to the appellant; she is “at the centre"" and there are references to ""other Acclaim staff”; she is said to be “ behind the cash for course work scam"". Her denial is reported, and at a number of places references to a cheat or to cheating do not point directly to her. Overall the strong support which the second article gives to a finding that this imputation was conveyed is no more than strong. Again a favourable finding would have caused no surprise, but it was not in my opinion wrong for reasonable people, charged by law with the task of determining the issue, not to conclude that imputation 5(b) as alleged is conveyed. 
     
      
    54 In my opinion the imputation in Question 5(c) is, on any reasonable approach to the second article, an imputation which the second article makes. It is indeed the whole subject of the second article; if the article does not convey the imputation that the appellant operated a tutoring business which engaged in fraud, no object or meaning for the article can be imagined. The contentions of senior counsel for the respondent included the contention that it was open to the jury to accept that the fraudsters were the students who submitted the course work and not the tutors of the College. This contention could not be upheld on any rational view of the terms of the second article. That the tutoring business was engaged in fraud is supported by the headings and references to the appellant and to Acclaim Education which I have earlier set out, and many references throughout. To take two high points (and there are others) in para 5 of the second article the appellant is “… the teacher at the centre of the cash-for-coursework scam …” and in para 37 she is “The teacher behind the cash-for-coursework scandal …”. That the appellant operated the tutoring business, and that the tutoring business engaged in fraud, is the whole burden of the article; except only and importantly for its references to her being sentenced to imprisonment - time served - many years ago in France in relation to gang offences against banks, the subject of imputation 5(d) which the jury found was conveyed. 
     
      
    55 In the presence of this material a decision that the article did not convey imputation 5(c) “The plaintiff operated a tutoring business that engaged in fraud” is beyond the range of decisions reasonably available.  
     
      
    56 Some other passages in the second article which clearly stated the same effect, including para 27 and para 63 might, at least in concept, be thought to have their force blunted by their being quotations or attributed statements; this led to debate about the effects of observations by Lord Devlin in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1964] AC 234 at 283-284 which concluded: “For the purpose of the law of libel a hearsay statement is the same as a direct statement, and that is all there is to it.” Senior counsel for the appellant made claims which in my view were unduly high about the effect of this passage which, in my understanding, and notwithstanding the forceful terms of the last sentence, leaves it to the jury to make the further interpretative step whether the person publishing the material complained of is endorsing the matter attributed to another person. I do not think that further examination of this is required for decision, as the contents of the second article established imputation 5(c) whether or not the attributed statements are under consideration.  
     
      
    57 In my opinion the Court of Appeal should set aside the jury's finding on Question 5(c) and order a new trial on that question, and on Question 6(c) which relates to whether that imputation was defamatory. 
     
      
    58 Imputations in the third article. With respect to Question 7(a) I am of a similar view to that I have expressed for Question 5(c). References to cheating in contexts referring to the appellant are scattered throughout the third article; and the third article is all about her, as the prominent photograph shows. Although it cannot be said that the imputation in Question 7(a) is entirely literally a quote from the third article, it is in my opinion so clearly conveyed by the terms of the article that the jury's finding is beyond the range of findings reasonably available. 
     
      
    59 Although as my judgment shows I am of the view that the jury was in error and acted unreasonably in answering some but not all of the Questions put to them, I do not regard it as appropriate to set aside all their answers and direct a general new trial on all issues. In my opinion new trial is required only on the particular questions on which my conclusions are adverse to the jury’s answers, that is Question 2 (and consequently Questions 3 and 4, which depend on it), Question 5(c) (and Question 6(c)) and Question 7(a) (and Question 8(a)). 
     
      
    60 In my opinion the Court of Appeal should order: 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal allowed with costs. 
       
       
      (2) Set aside the determinations of the Jury on Questions 2, 5(c) and 7 and order a new trial of Questions 2, 3, 4, 5(c), 6(c), 7 and 8.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Scott Peter Handley appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to four offences. They were committed very soon after Mr Handley was released on parole for very similar offences. That is a matter of serious concern and is obviously a matter of serious aggravation. The offender was sentenced to imprisonment for an offence of break enter and steal. He was dealt with in, what appears to have been, a fairly lenient manner. All that leniency did was enable him to be released earlier than he might otherwise have been and that in turn enabled him simply to re-commence his criminal offending earlier than he would otherwise. The time for leniency in Mr Handley’s case has passed. The time has come for sentences to be visited upon him which reflect the serious nature of his ongoing criminality, to protect householders from his repeated activity, and hopefully to deter him from continuing on the life that he has chosen to follow thus far. 2 The offender was released from custody on parole for an offence of break enter and steal, that was on 15 February 2006. For a short time he managed to remain drug free. I should interpolate here it is his addiction to drugs which has led to him committing such a large number of offences in the past. But it was only a relatively short time after his release that he relapsed and recommenced his drug use, gave up the job that he had managed to obtain and began supporting his drug habit through the commission of criminal offences. The first of those offences actually appears on a Form 1, that was committed on 21 May 2006. The Form 1 is attached to the offence of demand money with menaces which I will deal with shortly. The offence of 21 May 2006 involved the offender making a false statement to a pawnbroker when he produced some material to that pawnbroker in order to receive money for the item. The next offence is a matter that he is to be specifically sentenced for, that was an offence of break enter and steal on 26 May. He entered premises at Beacon Hill by removing two louvred sheets of glass. Once in there he took a Sony DVD recorder, a camera and a television. He left in a utility which I will mention again later because it is also the subject of an offence on a Form 1. He was identified as being the offender by his fingerprints being found there.3 The next offence for which the offender is to be sentenced occurred on 30 May 2006. Remarkably the victim of this offence, demanding money with menaces, is the offender’s mother. Perhaps even more remarkably she remains supportive of him and is in court today. She was at the Harbord Diggers Club, the offender approached her and demanded money from her. When she refused, (no doubt being aware that he intended to use it to get drugs) he blocked her path and would not let her pass. This upset her quite understandably and she became shaken and scared. The whole incident was captured on security footage in the club. The incident ended when the offender’s mother’s friend suggested that they would obtain assistance from a security guard there. The offender responded by saying to his mother “fuck you” and left the club. Then a few days later on 6 June 2006 the offender committed another offence of break enter and steal. This time he entered through a closed kitchen window. It seemed that he was watching the premises and waiting for the owner to leave and when she returned she actually saw the offender rushing out of the house. He did not actually manage to take from the house the plasma television which he had picked up, so fortunately for that household the plasma television was not taken.4 The final matter I should mention concerns the motor vehicle that the offender was using to carry out his offences. It was a stolen vehicle and the offender is to be dealt with for being carried in a conveyance. Also in that utility when it was stopped by police was found some property that led to an offence of goods in custody which is the second matter on the form one. 5 The offender was arrested on 8 June 2006, as I have noted he was on parole at the time and, his parole was subsequently revoked. He has been in custody continually since 8 June 2006, so I will commence the sentences I will shortly announce from that date.6 The offender has a lengthy drug history. It commenced soon after his father died when the offender was fifteen or sixteen years of age. As is the way of these things it began with alcohol and softer drugs before progressing to the offender’s drug of choice which is now heroin. He says that he has been able to control his addiction to the extent that he does not spend more than fifty dollars a day on heroin when he is using, but despite many efforts in the past, he has been unable to effectively rehabilitate himself from drug use. And, as his criminal history reveals, he has been continually committing offences for the purposes of obtaining money for drugs. Thus it is, in this case the offender needs to be both personally deterred from committing further offences but also to be given some assistance in rehabilitation. For that reason I will find in favour of the offender as regards special circumstances, as Mr Fraser asked me to do.7 The offender qualified as an electrician and indeed works as an electrician whilst in custody. He is capable of being a productive member of society. As I said, after he was released from parole early in 2006, he got work but gave it up once the drugs became a problem for him once again. I am satisfied that if the offender can overcome his drug addiction he will have a lot to contribute to society. The offender, I suspect, realises this. He seems to accept that he is wasting his life whilst in prison and being in prison is solely due to him using drugs whenever he is released from custody. 8 The offender wrote me a letter which I have read today. In that he notes that he is hurting the only people that he left, that is his mother and his two children. He is effectively denying his children a father, a circumstance which he feels poignantly, having lost his own father when he was quite young. I should note that the offender will do his time in custody harder because of what occurred to him in 1994 whilst he was in custody at that stage. I have taken that letter into account and will impose a sentence which is lower than it would otherwise have been because of those circumstances. I am also going to impose a lower sentence because of the offender’s early plea of guilty. I will discount the sentence I would otherwise impose by twenty five per cent to reflect that fact.9 The offender is remorseful in a sense that he recognises that he has done the wrong thing but he clearly recognises that at the time he commits the other offences and it does not prevent him from doing so. The need for him to obtain drugs overwhelms him. Again this is a matter where personal deterrence is important. If the offender is unable to control his criminal activities through recognition of how wrong they are, he must learn to control his criminal activities through recognising that if he offends, as he has, he will end up spending more time in gaol. Things are not all bleak, as I mentioned the offender’s mother has stood by him, she is supportive of him. The offender has, at times, been able to have short periods where he is not using drugs and he is reaching an age where he must realise he should do something about it unless he is to spend substantial parts of the remainder of his life in gaol. Mr Fraser, who appeared for the offender, recognised that an element of accumulation of the sentences was required in order to reflect the separate acts of criminality. Although they did occur over a short period where the offender was committing offences whilst addicted to drugs, every time he committed an offence there were victims of that offence. Those separate acts of criminality should be dealt with by separate sentences. As I said I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour. There is rehabilitation required if the offender is to give up his life of crime. This is not yet the time to give up hope that the offender will be able to do something about his addiction to drugs.10 The sentences I impose are as follows. For the offence of break enter and steal committed on 26 May 2006 I set a non-parole period of two years, to date from 8 June 2006, the total sentence in that matter being of four years. For the offence of demanding money with menaces, taking into account the matters on the Form 1 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years, to commence on 8 June 2006. That is a fixed term because of the other sentences I am imposing. For the offence of break enter and steal committed on 6 June 2006 I set a non-parole period of two years, to commence on 8 June 2007 and I set a head sentence of four years. For the offence of being carried in a conveyance I set a fixed term of two years he is also to commence on 8 June 2006. It is also a fixed term because of other sentences. The effect of my sentences is this, the offender has an effective non-parole period of three years and a period of eligibility for parole of two years, making a total sentence of five years.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
    Introduction 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The defendant, Paul Douglas Williams, has pleaded guilty to three offences against s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (“the NPW Act”) 
     
      
    2 Section 118A(2) states: 
     
      
       
        
        A person must not pick any plant that is of, or is part of, a threatened species, an endangered population or an endangered ecological community. 
        
       
      
    3 The question for determination is the appropriate penalty which should now be imposed. 
     
      
    4 The charges allege that the offences were committed by a corporation, Serenity Cove Management Pty Limited, and the defendant is charged in his capacity as a director of that corporation: see s 175B of the NPW Act. 
     
      
    5 Each charge alleges that between 1 December 2003 and continuing until about 29 February 2004, the corporation picked plants that were part of an endangered ecological community. The first charge (No. 50003 of 2006) alleges that the plants picked comprised “Sydney Freshwater Wetlands”. The second charge (No. 50004 of 2006) alleges that the plants picked comprised “Kurnell Dune Forest”. The third charge (No. 50005 of 2006) alleges that the plants picked comprised “Sydney Coastal Estuary Swamp Forest”. The maximum penalty for an offence against s 118A of the NPW Act is $220,000 or imprisonment for two years, or both, and an additional $11,000 for each whole plant that was affected by or concerned in the action constituting the offence. 
     
      
    6 “Pick” is defined in the NPW Act (s 5) to mean “gather, pluck, cut, pull up, destroy, poison, take, dig up, remove or injure the plant or any part of the plant.” 
     
      
    7 An “endangered ecological community” is defined in s 5 of the NPW Act as having the same meaning as in the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995, which in turn defines it as an ecological community specified in Pt 3 of Sch 1 of that Act. At the time of these offences that Schedule list the following, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        Kurnell Dune Forest in the Sutherland Shire and City of Rockdale (as described in the final determination of the Scientific Committee to list the ecological community) 
         
         
        Sydney Coastal Estuary Swamp Forest in the Sydney Basin Bioregion (as described in the final determination of the Scientific Committee to list the ecological community)”. 
        
       
       
        
        Sydney Freshwater Wetlands in the Sydney Basin Bioregion (as described in the final determination of the Scientific Committee to list the ecological community) 
         
        
       
       
       
      
    The relevant facts 
     
      
    8 The relevant evidence is contained in many lever-arch files of affidavits. The utilitarian value of the plea of guilty is demonstrated by the fact that the parties have been able to condense the relevant facts into an agreed statement of facts, one affidavit, an accompanying bundle of documents and photographs. 
     
      
    9 The land upon which the offences took place is known as Nos. 238-258 Captain Cook Drive, Kurnell, being lot 102 in deposited plan 1027438, and was at the relevant time owned by Serenity Cove Business Park Pty Ltd. The defendant was the sole director and secretary of that company. A number of other corporations operated from the premises, including Serenity Cove Management Pty Ltd, all of which the defendant was also the sole director and secretary.10 In early January 2004 the defendant, on behalf of Serenity Cove Management Pty Ltd, approached IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd, a company that specialises in clearing vegetation and bushfire mitigation work. On or about 17 January 2004, Mr David Silcock, the general manager of IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd, together with Mr Lance Fairbrother, met the defendant and Mr Richard Harris, the director of development of Serenity Cove Management Pty Ltd, at the subject property, where the defendant showed Mr Silcock and Mr Fairbrother areas he wanted cleared and mulched. As a result of the meeting a decision was taken that the removal of vegetation would be best achieved through the use of an excavator and tractor and with mulching equipment and an excavator with a groomer attached. 
     
      
    11 On 23 January 2004, Serenity Cove Management Pty Ltd entered into a contract with IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd for the clearing of vegetation on the various areas of the site. The contract was signed by the defendant and by Mr David Silcock, the general manager of IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd. IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd in turn arranged for two sub-contractors to supply the equipment and do the work under Mr Fairbrother’s supervision. 
     
      
    12 The clearing of vegetation and mulching in the areas nominated by the defendant took place from 29 January 2004 to 8 February 2004. The defendant went to the site about four or five times whilst the clearing was being undertaken, when he discussed with Mr Fairbrother the work being carried out by the sub-contractors. The defendant expressed satisfaction with the work being then undertaken. 
     
      
    13 Several areas of the subject land were cleared. The parties have agreed that the total of the areas cleared is no more than 2.9 hectares. The areas cleared contained significant numbers of native plants which, by their type and combination, comprised each of the relevant endangered ecological communities. 
     
      
    14 The clearing came to the attention of Sutherland Shire Council on about 10 February 2004 after being advised by members of the public. Shortly thereafter officers of the council and an officer of the Department of Environment and Conservation (“the DEC”), Mr Jason Bentley, went to the site where they saw tracts of cleared land with virtually all vegetation removed. The cleared part of the ground was covered in what appeared to be a wood chip mulch. 
     
      
    15 In early 2004, as part of his investigation, Mr Bentley served notices requiring the defendant’s company to supply information and records relating to the investigation of the clearing. In response to the first notice issued on 19 February 2004, Mr Stephen De Lapp on behalf of Serenity Cove Business Park Pty Ltd indicated that the clearing could only have resulted from the activities of another company, Lilliendal Civil Pty Ltd, which had been engaged to build a platform and undertake earthmoving works for a film set on another part of the land and from actions by the defendant’s son, Mr Nicholas Williams, in carrying out weed reduction. Although the notice required Serenity Cove Business Park Pty Ltd to provide information as to who did the clearing during the relevant period, the company did not supply any information or records which indicated that either IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd or anyone else apart from Mr Nicholas Williams or Lilliendal Civil Pty Ltd were doing any relevant works on the site. 
     
      
    16 On 31 May 2004 Mr Bentley interviewed Mr Dominic Fanning, the defendant’s environmental consultant, who had apparently been engaged to carry out mapping of flora and fauna constraints as part of a Site Constraints Analysis to be used as the basis for a development application for a subdivision of the land. The subdivision application had been lodged with the council on 24 July 2003. Mr Fanning agreed that the site contained the three endangered ecological communities and that he had informed the defendant that the vegetation on the site was protected. 
     
      
    17 On 6 July 2005 Mr Bentley served Ms Diana Marshall, administrative assistant for the Serenity Cove/Williams’ group a companies, who was employed by Serenity Cove Management Pty Ltd with a notice under the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (as it applies to the NPW Act) requiring information and records. Mr Bentley served another notice requiring Serenity Cove Business Park Pty Ltd to nominate a person to be interviewed on its behalf. After communicating with the defendant’s lawyers on several occasions, Mr Bentley arranged to interview the defendant and the companies’ employees on 27 and 28 July 2005. 
     
      
    18 The record of interview with the defendant on 28 July 2005 is in evidence. The defendant said in the interview that he had asked his son and two other employees to spray and slash weeds, namely pampas grass and bitou bush. He denied that he had authorised the removal of native vegetation. I observe that this answer was a lie: as noted above the defendant had signed a contract with IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd for it to clear the areas which he himself had nominated; moreover, the defendant visited the site on a number of occasions when the clearing was being undertaken and expressed satisfaction with the works. 
     
      
    19 The defendant also said in the interview that he was not someone who supervised the removal of the vegetation. This again was a lie; as sole director and secretary of the company the defendant himself not only told Mr Fairbrother and Mr Silcock what areas he wanted cleared but, as already noted, he visited the site on four or five occasions and expressed satisfaction with the work. The defendant also denied that he was personally involved in the removal of any vegetation – an evasive answer in light of the fact that he expressly authorised it.  
     
      
    20 In the record of interview with Ms Marshall, she informed Mr Bentley that any invoices and other paper work from contractors engaged to do the works on the site would be in the office as she would have arranged payment. On 22 August 2005, based on what he had been told by Ms Marshall, Mr Bentley by a further notice required further information and records from Serenity Cove Business Park Pty Ltd. In response that company, on 13 September 2005, supplied information and records which had not been previously supplied, but no documents or information was supplied relating to IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd or the sub-contractors who did the clearing. The only relevant records supplied were invoices for works done by Mr Peter Mangan of Baycastle. A record of interview was later conducted with Mr Mangan who said that he only undertook weeding using a backhoe on other parts of the site. 
     
      
    21 Further notices requiring information and records were served on Serenity Cove Business Park Pty Ltd and another associated company of which the defendant was sole director and secretary, Parist Holdings Pty Ltd. Parist Holdings Pty Ltd had receivers and managers appointed to run its affairs. The response to the notice came from the receivers and managers, Deloitte Touché Tohmatsu, rather than the defendant or one of his staff. 
     
      
    22 The response contained information concerning a contractor, IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd which had been engaged specifically to undertake the removal and mulching of the vegetation on the site in January and February 2004, which is now the subject of the present charges. This was the first time that the DEC had obtained any information about the involvement of IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd. As a result of the information obtained from the receivers and managers of Parist Holdings Pty Ltd, further enquiries were made in late 2005 and early 2006 which resulted in evidence being obtained from IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd showing its involvement and that of its sub-contractors and the defendant’s involvement in the offences. 
     
      
    23 It is thus apparent that the following conclusions may be drawn about the defendant’s conduct:(a) The defendant expressly authorised IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd to carry out the clearing, as he signed the contract with IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd and personally showed the representatives of that company the areas he wanted to be cleared. 
     
      
    (b) At the time of authorising the clearing, the defendant was aware from what he had been told by his environmental consultant, Mr Fanning, that the areas contained protected vegetation. 
     
      
    (c) The defendant personally inspected the clearing on four or five occasions when it was being carried out and expressed his satisfaction with what was being done. 
     
      
    (d) The defendant and his staff failed to supply the relevant information sought by the DEC and, moreover, supplied misleading information alleging that the work was done by another company that was building a film set on another part of the land and that there had only been weed reduction works carried out by the defendant’s son. 
     
      
    (e) The defendant denied during his record of interview that he had anything to do with the clearing which became the subject of the present charges, again asserting that all that he had authorised was the clearing of weeds by his son and other employees. This was a lie in that he had personally engaged IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd to do the work and he had overseen the work whilst it was being done. 
     
      
    (f) Whilst the defendant maintained an air of cooperation during the investigation, his actions and those of his employees of the companies that he controlled hampered and hindered the DEC’s investigation into the identity of those responsible for the offences. In particular, documents relating to the engagement of IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd were withheld. 
     
      
    (g) It was only as a result of information furnished by the receivers and managers of Parist Holdings Pty Ltd that the departmental officers were led to obtain information from IDS Consulting Services Pty Ltd and its sub-contractors which in turn disclosed the defendant’s involvement in the offence. 
     
      
       
      
    Maximum penalty24 The maximum penalty fixed by the Parliament in this case in monetary terms is $220,000, and $11,000 for each plant that was affected. Moreover, Parliament has provided for a term of imprisonment as an alternative or in addition to, the imposition of a monetary penalty.Environmental harm25 The evidence of the environmental harm resulting from the offences is in the undisputed evidence of a flora consultant, Ms Teresa James. The clearing the subject of the charges has had a significant effect on the ecological communities on the defendant’s property. I accept the evidence of Ms James: 
     
      
       
      (a) The removal of trees on the site has resulted in damage to habitat of Sydney Freshwater Wetlands, Sydney Coastal Estuary Swamp Forest and Kurnell Dune Forest, through loss of vegetation structure, changes to plant composition and frequency, changes to soil, drainage and other local environmental conditions. 
       
        
         
        
       
      (b) As a result of 1.7 hectares of Sydney Coastal Estuary Swamp Forest being cleared on the site, the soil surface has dried, rootstock and seed in the soil seedbank has been suffocated and a corridor has been provided for weedy species to infiltrate core areas of Sydney Coastal Estuary Swamp Forest on the site. 
      
     
     
      
      (c) As a result of 0.8 hectares of Sydney Freshwater Wetlands being cleared on the site, some permanent loss of the Sydney Freshwater Wetlands will occur due to the major sand removal and redistribution that has raised the surface level and significantly altered the hydrology. Moreover, weed species have rapidly colonised the cleared areas and the cutting of tracks in other areas could potentially spread weeds into the Sydney Freshwater Wetlands areas that remain intact. 
      
     
     
      
      (d) Clearing and earthworks on the site has also affected the Kurnell Dune Forest. The removal of trees has significantly degraded the limited occurrence of Kurnell Dune Forest at the site. Rapid infestation and spread of weed species has occurred in parts of Kurnell Dune Forest on the site.  
      
     
     
      
      (e) A substantial reduction in area of vegetation from clearing and associated earthworks has resulted in permanent loss of biodiversity at the site.  
      
     
     
      
      (f) The removal of trees on the site has resulted in significant fragmentation of a previously intact vegetation area. Connectivity between the vegetation and similar communities to the north of the site has been affected.  
      
     
     
      
      (g) The clearing of native vegetation provides an opportunity for exotic species to invade and become established and accordingly the number and abundance of exotic species typically increases. The average percentage of exotic species recorded in the cleared areas was greater than the average percentage of exotic species recorded in the adjoining intact areas.  
      
    (h) The clearing of vegetation, earthworks and the covering of the soil surface with various materials that have occurred on the site have caused significant alteration of the local drainage patterns and characteristics. Both Sydney Freshwater Wetlands and Sydney Coastal Estuary Swamp Forest are dependant on a high water table and periodically waterlogged soils and consequently are sensitive to any changes in hydrology.  
     
      
      (i) The natural regeneration process at the site has been significantly hampered and the success of re-sprouting and seeding establishment has been reduced as a result of dead vegetative material and mulch being left on the soil surface and blown sand from cleared and disturbed areas. 
      
    26 The actual harm caused in the present case had been noted in pars [13] and [25] above. The total area which was cleared of endangered ecological community was significant. It is action such as this which operates to defeat the purpose of the legislation, which is to protect areas known to be endangered. The very fact that the particular ecological communities are listed as endangered is sufficient to regard any large-scale damage or destruction of them to be properly regarded as significant. 
     
      
       
      
    Reasons for committing the offences 
     
      
    27 The defendant himself has not given evidence. I am nevertheless satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that his motivation for committing the offences was to prepare the way for subdivision consent by undermining the status of the area as worthy of conservation. The defendant’s actions were in blatant disregard of the advice of his own consultant and he must have known that what he was doing was wrong. 
     
      
    28 As noted in paragraph [18] above, I reject totally the assertion made in the defendant’s records of interview that his motivation was simply a laudable desire to control weeds. 
     
      
       
      
    Sentencing considerations 
    29 Any sentencing exercise requires consideration of the purposes of sentencing. These purposes are set out in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 3A: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
         
        (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
         
        (c) to protect the community from the offender, 
         
        (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
         
        (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
         
        (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
         
        (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 
        
       
       
      These purposes overlap. 
       
      
    30 The primary consideration in sentencing is the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence: Fletcher Construction Australia Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Fisher) (1999) 91 IR 66 at 77-87, Lawrenson Diecasting Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Ch’ng) (1999) 90 IR 464 at 474-475. The primary indicator of the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence is the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature. A number of other factors highlight the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence in this instance.Foreseeability of risk of harm31 A factor that highlights the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence in this instance is the extent to which the defendant could reasonably have foreseen the harm caused by the commission of the offence. In the present case the defendant knew, because he was told by his environmental consultant, that the vegetation on the site was protected. Moreover, the damage that was done was not only foreseeable, but was the intended outcome of the clearing which took place.32 The defendant could have and should have refrained from arranging the clearing until the development application for subdivision had been determined. No doubt the presence of the endangered ecological communities on the land would have been a relevant factor in the local planning authority’s consideration of the development application. Moreover, rather than selective clearing, the defendant arranged for mass clearing and mulching, which had the maximum possible detrimental effect on those communities. 
     
      
    33 The offences involve three separate but connected criminal acts: s 21A(2)(m), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Moreover, the defendant committed the offences deliberately, in the full knowledge that his actions were unlawful and that the vegetation was protected. The defendant then sought to conceal his involvement and the involvement of his companies from the DEC and lied in the course of his record of interview.Subjective circumstances of the defendant34 The court may take into account favourable and unfavourable factors personal to the offender: Veen v The Queen (No.2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 491.  
     
      
      Prior criminality 
      
    35 The defendant does have a prior criminal record. This includes a number of driving offences and one charge of common assault, but no prior environmental offences. 
     
      
      Prior good character 
      
    36 A number of testimonials have been tendered which describe the defendant’s generosity in contributing to a variety of community and charitable causes. Some of these pre-date the present charges. The two testimonials which post-date the charges do not state whether the writer is aware of the charges. 
     
      
      Plea of guilty 
      
    37 The defendant has pleaded guilty to each of the offences: s 21A(3)(k) and s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In entering a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity the defendant is entitled to a discount to reflect its utilitarian value. I have noted the utilitarian value in this case in par [8] above. This has saved this Court a considerable amount of time and has avoided inconvenience to witnesses. The utilitarian value of a plea of guilty merits a discount in the penalty in the range of 10 to 25 per cent: R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 419 [160].  I do not, however, accept the pleas of guilty as an expression of contrition or remorse, given that the defendant positively misled the investigators during the course of their investigation, and given the fact that no express statement of contrition has been made by the defendant in the proceedings. The pleas of guilty, rather than being indicative of contrition or remorse, appear to be a recognition of the inevitable in the face of a strong prosecution case. 
     
      
      Contrition and remorse 
      
    38 Evidence of contrition, repentance and remorse after the offence are relevant mitigating factors. Again, I note that the defendant has not given evidence, so that the Court does not have the benefit of any explanation for this conduct, neither is there any express statement of regret or remorse for his actions. 
     
      
      Assistance to authorities 
      
    39 The defendant lied to the prosecutor about his involvement in the clearing and misled the prosecutor in the latter’s investigation of the offence and hindered that investigation. 40 Rather than provide assistance to those persons who were investigating the offences, the defendant hindered the investigation and positively misled the investigation and sought to conceal his involvement in the offences. I have set out in pars [18] and [19] above the lies that he told in the course of his record of interview and I have set out in par [23] (d) to (g) my conclusions on the evidence showing the hindrance to the investigation and the misinformation given to the investigatory officers.  
     
      
      Capacity to pay fines 
      
    41 In the exercise by a court of a discretion to fix the amount of any fine, the court is required to consider the defendant’s means to pay: s 6, Fines Act 1996. In the present case, no information or evidence was given as to the defendant’s means to pay and no submission was made that he would be unable to pay whatever fine the court may impose. I note that the defendant agrees to an order to pay the prosecutor’s costs in the sum of $85,000.General deterrence42 In considering the question of penalty generally and for environmental offences such as this in particular, general deterrence is a major consideration: Axer Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 113 LGERA 357 at 359; Camilleri’s Stock Feeds Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 32 NSWLR 683 at 701; Capral Aluminium Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610, Carlino v Leichhardt Council (2005) 144 LGERA 235. 
     
      
    43 Persons will not be deterred from committing environmental offences by nominal fines. There is a need to uphold the integrity of the system of protecting and preserving endangered ecological communities. There is a need to send a strong warning to others who may be minded to breach the law that such actions will be visited with significant consequences.Totality principle44 The principle of totality applies when sentencing for two or more offences. In the present case the three offences arise out of a single course of conduct on the same parcel of land, so that the principle of totality applies. It just so happens that there were three kinds of endangered ecological community within the total area that was cleared. Where, as here, the three offences are to be seen as sufficiently connected, the penalty should reflect the total criminality involved in all the offences: Camilleri’s Stock Feeds at 704. 
     
      
    45 This requires the Court to first fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider the question of totality by adjusting the adequate sentences having regard to the total criminality involved. It is appropriate to do so in the present case in view of the fact that the three offences are the result of a single course of conduct.Even-handedness principle46 The principle of even-handedness requires the Court to have regard to the pattern of sentences currently being imposed in like case: Camilleri’s Stock Feeds at 701-702. The obvious difficulty with this is that no two cases are truly alike – one is presented with a range. Thus, in Carmody v Brancourts Nominees Pty Ltd; Carmody v Brancourt [No. 2] [2003] NSWLEC 84, the defendant cleared about 2.5 hectares of Koala habitat, knowing that the land was Koala habitat prior to the clearing, an offence against s 118D of the NPW Act. The offence carried a maximum penalty of $110,000. The defendant was fined $5,000, ordered to carry out remediation works at a cost of $5,000, and ordered to pay costs of $30,000. In Director General of National Parks and Wildlife v Wilkinson & Anor; Director General of the Department of Land and Water Conservation v Wilkinson & Anor [2002] NSWLEC 171, the defendant cleared 25.6 hectares of land that was habitat of a number of species, an offence against s 118D of the NPW Act carrying a maximum penalty of $110,000. The defendant was fined a total of $43,500 for a number of related offences and ordered to pay costs of $90,000. In Bentley v Gordon [2005] NSWLEC 695, the offence was against s 118A(2) of the NPW Act which is similar to the current offence. Some 19.05 hectares of a total area of 44 hectares was cleared, which contained a plant known as Tetratheca juncea or Black Eyed Susan, a vulnerable species. The Court imposed a fine of $30,000 where the maximum penalty was $55,000 and ordered to pay costs of $10,000. In all of these cases the defendant had pleaded guilty. Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd (2006) 145 LGERA 234 was a prosecution against the landowner in relation to the same incident as Gordon. The case was heard ex parte. The defendant was fined $40,000 plus costs where the maximum penalty was $55,000. 
     
      
    47 The defendant submits that the present offences are no more serious than these in Bancourts Nominees and in Wilkinson and less serious than these in Gordon and BGP Properties. I do not agree. The present offences were committed intentionally, knowing that the areas were protected, and following the event the defendant attempted to cover up his involvement by lying to and misleading the investigators of the offence. 
     
      
    48 In Garrett v Williams [2006] NSWLEC 785 (not the present defendant), the defendant arranged for trees which were part of an endangered ecological community, to be cleared on his land, an offence against s 118A(2) of the NPW Act. The offence, being the same as the present offences, carried a maximum penalty of $220,000 or imprisonment for two years or both and an additional penalty of $11,000 in respect of each whole plant that was affected by or concerned in the action that constituted the offence. The defendant was fined a total of $180,000 for the two related offences and was ordered to pay the prosecutor’s costs. 49 In the present case the defendant has agreed to pay the prosecutor’s costs in the agreed sum of $85,000. I accept the defendant’s submission that the payment of substantial costs is an important part of the punishment to be taken into account in the overall penalty: Environmental Protection Authority v Barnes [2006] NSWCCA 246 per Mason P, Kirby and Hoeben JJ.50 The mass clearing of some 2.9 hectares containing endangered ecological communities involved the destruction of many hundreds of trees comprising those communities. In addition to a maximum penalty of $220,000 for each offence, the legislation sets an additional penalty of $11,000 for each plant that was affected. The prescription by Parliament of an additional penalty is intended to enable the total penalty to be proportionate to the extent of harm caused by the actions constituting the offence. By prescribing an additional penalty, Parliament has expressed that the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence increases with the number of whole plants affected by or concerned in the action constituting the offence (Garrett v Williams, at [94], per Preston J)51 Since the whole of the 2.9 hectares was mass cleared and then mulched, the precise number of the whole plants that was destroyed is not known. From the evidence of Ms James and from the photographs that are in evidence it is self-evident that it was well over a thousand in total, and probably many more than that on a most conservative estimate. As the precise number of trees affected by or concerned in the clearing on the site can not be determined conclusively, it is not possible to accurately calculate any additional penalty that could be imposed for each whole plant affected. The defendant should not, however, escape the additional penalty prescribed by the legislation simply because he destroyed, by mulching, the evidence of the precise number of whole plants that were affected. The damage caused by the offence was undoubtedly substantial. This is an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence: s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.52 As Preston J noted in Garrett v Williams at [121], the carrying out of an offence to make a profit, or to save incurring an expense or to avoid the cost of obtaining and implementing a statutory permission such as a development consent or environment protection licence increases the seriousness of the crime. Offenders should not profit from crime: see State Pollution Control Commission v T J Bryant Pty Ltd, NSWLEC, , 11 June 1991, Stein J, unreported; Environment Protection Authority v Gardner, NSWLEC, 7 November 1997, Lloyd J, unreported; R v F Howe & Son (Engineers) Ltd [1999] 2 All ER 249 at 254; R v Milford Haven Port Authority [2000] JPL 943 at 950; Environment Protection Authority v Australian Waste Recyclers 1 Pty Ltd [2005] NSWLEC 739 per Cowdroy J at [97]-[99], [149] and [167]; Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd (2006) 145 LGERA 234 per Preston at 269 [238], 270 [246] and [247]; Cameron v Eurobodalla Shire Council (2006) 146 LGERA 349 per Preston J at 364 [70]; and Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council (2006) 145 LGERA 189 per Preston J at 221 at [140]-[141].53 Having regard to the cases referred to above, but in particular to Garrett v Williams, I consider that an appropriate penalty for each offence warrants a fine of $180,000. This figure should be discounted by 20% for the utilitarian benefit of the plea, noting that the plea was entered at an early stage of the prosecution, resulting in a total fine of $154,000.54 The aggregate fine for the three offences thus determined amounts to $462,000. In applying the totality principle and having regard to the total criminality involved, this aggregate exceeds what is just and appropriate. I would therefore adjust the aggregate penalty to $330,000, apportioned between the three offences. 
     
      
    55 The prosecutor seeks in addition to a substantial penalty a community service order or home detention. The prosecutor relies upon the fact that the maximum penalty is not only a monetary sum but also imprisonment for two years. The proceedings were accordingly adjourned to enable a pre-sentence report to be obtained. 
     
      
    56 The defendant compounded the seriousness of the offence with his lies and misleading statements during the course of the investigations. These factors, together with the overall seriousness of the offences considered in light of the maximum penalty fixed by Parliament, persuade me that there should be a further penalty by way of a community service order.57 Section 8(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 states that an order can be made requiring an offender to perform community service work for a number of hours not exceeding the number of hours prescribed by the regulations. Clause 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2000 ties the number of hours of community service work that may be imposed to the maximum term of imprisonment available for the offence. It provides that where the maximum term of imprisonment exceeds one year (as in this case) there is a limit of 500 hours of community service.58 I am satisfied by the pre-sentence report that the defendant is a suitable person for community service work and it is appropriate in all the circumstances to require him to perform community service work, that arrangements exist in the area in which he resides for the performance of such work, and he has signed an undertaking to comply with the obligations under a community service order as required by s 86(1)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
       
      
    Orders59 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      Proceedings No. 50003 of 2006

      JUDGMENT – Evidence - Admissibility of portions of the ERISP with John Siose (tx p199). 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On the fifth day of the trial, I allowed the tender by the Crown prosecutor of portions of the recorded interview by police of John Siose. These are my reasons for that decision. 
     
      
    2 The accused is charged with the murder of Dong Jun Kim at an amusement parlour at Parramatta in the afternoon of 27 July 2005. It is alleged that he stabbed the deceased with a knife in the course of a violent incident in which he was involved with a companion, John Siose. Siose is also charged with the murder, upon the basis of joint criminal enterprise. He is to be tried separately from the accused and, it is expected, immediately after the present trial.  
     
      
    3 There is a body of evidence from witnesses who were at the amusement parlour but who did not know the accused or Mr Siose. One of those witnesses, Eric Liu, described the incident and, in particular, described seeing a man strike the deceased with what he thought was a stick. He later identified the accused and Mr Siose from photographs, assigning the role of the man with the stick to the accused. Neither of the other two witnesses in this category saw the deceased struck with an object of any kind and, while one of them identified a photograph of Mr Siose, neither identified the accused.  
     
      
    4 Also in the amusement parlour at the time were two witnesses, JP and AN, both of whom knew the accused and Mr Siose. They both had made statements to the police in August 2005, in which they squarely implicated the accused in the stabbing. JP in his statement said that he had seen the accused stab the deceased in the back with a knife. In his statement AN did not say that he had seen the stabbing but he said that he had seen the accused holding a bloodstained knife at the relevant time.  
     
      
    5 Both witnesses resiled from those accounts at the trial, and I granted the Crown prosecutor leave under s38 of the Evidence Act to question each of them as though he were cross-examining them. In cross-examination by Ms Yehia, for the accused, it emerged that they had given accounts equally inconsistent with those August 2005 statements in earlier statements to the police and in evidence at the committal proceedings. While it would be open to the jury to find that the August 2005 statements contained the truth, obviously there is a real question about their credibility. 
     
      
    6 It is against that background that the significance of the evidence the subject of this ruling must be understood. The Crown prosecutor called Mr Siose to give evidence, even though he is yet to face trial himself. That is a course which is permissible by the terms of s17(3) of the Evidence Act (subject to the exercise of any relevant discretion by the trial judge). Mr Siose entered the witness box but, after giving his name, refused to give any other evidence. He maintained that stance even though I warned him of the possible consequences of it. However, unlike the accused, he had taken part in a videotaped interview with police in which he had given a lengthy and detailed account of what had happened. The Crown prosecutor tendered certain portions of that interview, to which Ms Yehia objected.  
     
      
    7 The effect of what Mr Siose told the police is that both he and the accused were carrying knives. The incident started because of some provocative behaviour on the part of the deceased, which led both Mr Siose and the accused to present their knives. There was then a fist fight between Mr Siose and the deceased, which the deceased started and in which he gained the upper hand. Shortly afterwards, Mr Siose and the accused ran from the amusement parlour. He did not see the accused stab the deceased, and he did not use his own knife.  
     
      
    8 Obviously this evidence is important in that it provides some explanation for the incident, it puts a knife into the hands of the accused, and it conveys that Mr Siose himself did not stab the deceased. Mr Siose also told the police that, after they had run out of the premises, the accused told him that he had stabbed the deceased. The Crown prosecutor did not press that material, acknowledging that it would amount to second-hand hearsay: cf s62 of the Evidence Act and Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594. 
     
      
    9 He tendered the rest of the material upon the basis that it was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under s65(2)(d) of the Evidence Act, that is, that it contained statements against the interests of Mr Siose at the time they were made. He submitted that, as Mr Siose had refused to give evidence, he was “not available” for the purpose of that section: see cl 4(1)(f) of Part 2 of the Dictionary to the Act. He relied upon R v Suteski (2002) 56 NSWLR 182, in which the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the admission at the trial of one offender of part of the police interview of another offender in circumstances not dissimilar to the present case.  
     
      
    10 In the light of Suteski, it is clear that evidence of statements to police by an alleged co-offender might be admitted in circumstances such as these. Ms Yehia accepted as much. However, she objected to the evidence on several bases. 
     
      
    11 Firstly, she argued that what Mr Siose said to the police did not amount to statements against his interests, because nothing he said could be seen as an admission of complicity in the killing of the deceased. While his account disclosed his knowledge that the accused had a knife, it conveyed that he did not contemplate the possibility that the accused would use it and, indeed, that the stabbing was the result of an intervention by the accused which was wholly unexpected by him.  
     
      
    12 The difficulty with that argument is s65(7) of the Evidence Act, which provides that a representation is to be taken to be against the interests of the person who made it if, among other things, it tends to show that the person has committed an offence of which he has not been convicted: par(b). As the Crown prosecutor pointed out, Mr Siose’s presentation of the knife towards the deceased at the beginning of the incident amounted to an assault. Indeed, the Crown prosecutor foreshadowed that at his trial the Crown case would be founded upon the allegation of a joint criminal enterprise between him and the accused to assault the deceased.  
     
      
    13 I am satisfied that the statements by Mr Siose to the police upon which the Crown relies were against his interests. Ms Yehia submitted that his assertion that he did not use his own knife (apart from showing it to the deceased) should not be admitted, as it was not of itself inculpatory. However, it is not necessary to examine each question and answer separately. That he did not use his own knife was part of his narrative of the event, all of which was capable of implicating him in the relevant sense: cf Suteski at [93]. 
     
      
    14 Otherwise, Ms Yehia relied on considerations of public policy concerning the reception of the evidence of an accomplice, and on ss135 & 137 of the Evidence Act. The question of policy arises from the fact that Mr Siose is yet to face trial himself. (In Suteski the offender whose statements to the police were admitted had been dealt with for his part in the criminal enterprise at the time of the trial. However, as in the present case, the Crown tendered parts of his interview with police at a time when he was a suspect.) Ms Yehia mounted this argument before Mr Siose was called, against the possibility that he would give evidence, but it is appropriate to consider it in determining the admissibility of the material from his interview. 
     
      
    15 The relevant policy was expressed by Lee J in R v Booth [1982] 2 NSWLR 847 at 851:  
     
      
       
        
        In this State, the practice is, when the Crown intends to call an accomplice, for the judge to sentence the accomplice, if he is charged, and to do that before he is called; and I would say that that practice is one which should be followed in all cases, unless there are the most cogent reasons for not so doing. By following that practice and disclosing to the jury that the accomplice has been dealt with means that the jury are not placed in a position of speculation in regard to the accomplice, and his position as a witness for the Crown and having the full facts before them can do justice to the accused and the Crown in regard to the extent to which his evidence is accepted.  
        
       
      
    16 However, subsequent authority has emphasised that this is a rule of practice rather than a rule of law and has recognised that, while it remains a sound practice, its importance has been diminished by legislation enabling the Crown to seek appellate review of a sentence passed upon an offender who has failed to honour an undertaking to give evidence against a co-offender: see R v Ambrosi [2004] NSWCCA 23 per Whealey J at [15]-[17]. As his Honour there observed, more emphasis is now placed upon appropriate directions to the jury. Mr Siose’s position as a suspect when he was interviewed by police clearly bears upon the reliability of what he said, but that is a matter for directions. I would not reject the evidence on this basis.  
     
      
    17 Finally, Ms Yehia argued that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, invoking the discretion in s135 of the Evidence Act and the judgement required by s137. This argument was based partly upon the history of the proceedings. The Crown initially intended to have the accused and Mr Siose tried jointly, and an application for a separate trial was lodged on behalf of the accused. However, a few days before the trial was to begin the Crown prosecutor determined, as a matter of fairness, that the two men should be tried separately. It was decided that the accused should be tried first, as it was he who was alleged to have stabbed the deceased. 
     
      
    18 It was apparently on the last working day before the trial that it occurred to the Crown prosecutor that Mr Siose might be called as a witness for the Crown in the trial of the accused. He notified Ms Yehia that he was contemplating that course but that he would see how the evidence unfolded before he made a decision about it. He made that decision on the third day of the trial. It was later ascertained, through senior counsel representing Mr Siose, that he would refuse to give evidence. The Crown prosecutor then decided that, in that event, he would tender relevant portions of the recorded interview. 
     
      
    19 Ms Yehia pointed out that, if this evidence were admitted, the accused’s position could be worse than it would have been if he had been tried jointly with Mr Siose. At a joint trial Mr Siose, as an “associated defendant” would not have been a compellable witness against the accused: s17(3) of the Evidence Act. Nor could any part of his police interview have been tendered against the accused under s65 of the Act, because he would not have been unavailable to give evidence within the terms of cl 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary. Accordingly, the jury would have to have been directed that the interview was evidence against Mr Siose only.  
     
      
    20 All this is true, but it does not appear to me that the history of the proceedings bears upon the question of prejudice to the accused. If the Crown prosecutor had decided to take the present course at the outset, it would have been open to him to proceed against the two men separately. Whichever of them had been tried first, Mr Siose would have been a compellable witness against the accused and, if he refused to give evidence, s65 would have been available as a means to get relevant parts of his police interview into evidence. 
     
      
    21 Otherwise, on the balance of probative value and unfair prejudice, Ms Yehia relied upon the fact, to which I have referred, that Mr Siose’s statements were made at a time when he was a suspect in relation to the murder, together with the obvious fact that his account would not be on oath and would not be able to be tested by cross-examination. The approach to the assessment of the unfair prejudice of evidence is well settled by authority, which was summarised by Wood CJ at CL in Suteski at [116]-[117]. In my view, the tendered evidence has significant probative value, which is not outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. Such prejudice as was identified by Ms Yehia is appropriately dealt with by directions to the jury along the lines of those sanctioned in Suteski at [130]-[131]. 
     
      
    22 None of this is to deny that I have found this a difficult and troubling decision. The admission of evidence of this kind cuts across long standing rules of engagement in criminal trials. However, the landscape has changed significantly under the Evidence Act and it appears to me that the provisions of that Act, and the principles which have been developed governing the application of them, warrant the admission of the evidence in the present case.

    3 The offences the subject of the indictment were committed between 16 March 2002 and 12 June 2003. The offences were: 
     
      
    · two offences of aggravated break, enter and steal;· two offences of aggravated steal and break out;· one offence of attempted robbery in company;· one offence of attempted carjacking. 
     
      
    4 Pursuant to s97(1) and s344A of the Crimes Act 1900, each of the offences of aggravated break, enter and steal and aggravated steal and break out carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years; the offence of attempted robbery in company similarly carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years; pursuant to s154C(2) of the Crimes Act, the offence of aggravated attempted carjacking carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Pursuant to Part 4, Division 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act each of the second of the offences of aggravated steal and break out, and the offence of aggravated attempted carjacking is subject to a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for five years. (The reason the earlier offence of aggravated steal and break out is not similarly so subject is that it was committed prior to the introduction of the legislation imposing that sentencing regime.) 
     
      
    5 The Form 1 offences were: 
     
      
    · two offences of take and drive a conveyance without the consent of the owner;· one offence of being carried in a conveyance without the consent of the owner;· one offence of break and enter with intent to steal;· one offence of goods in custody. 
     
      
    6 Blackmore DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
    · Count 1 (aggravated break, enter and steal, and taking into account the Form 1 offences): a non-parole period of imprisonment for four years to date from 17 December 2003, with a balance of term of two years;· Count 2 (aggravated break, enter and steal): imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years, to date from 17 December 2005, with a balance of term of one year and three months;· Count 3 (aggravated steal and break out): imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years to date from 17 December 2006, with a balance of term of one year and three months;· Count 4 (aggravated steal and break out): imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years to date from 17 December 2007, with a balance of term of one year and three months;· Count 5 (attempted robbery in company): imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and three months to date from 17 December 2009, with a balance of term of three years;· Count 6 (aggravated attempted carjacking): imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years to date from 17 December 2008, with a balance of term of one year and three months. 
     
      
    7 By reason of the manner in which his Honour accumulated the sentences, the overall sentence was one of imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight years and three months, with a balance of term of three years (a total term of eleven years and three months). 
     
      
    8 The applicant makes no complaint about any of the individual sentences. Two issues arise in the application. They concern the length of the total sentence, resulting from the accumulation; and the structure of the sentence, in the proportions between the non-parole period and the total sentence. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    9 The first offence on the indictment (aggravated break, enter and steal) was committed during the evening of 16 March 2002 or the early hours of the following morning. The applicant broke and entered a private residence in Mosman, in which the occupants were sleeping. He searched through three rooms and stole a sum of $2,000 in cash from a wallet. He also stole a set of keys to a Mercedes Benz car, which he then proceeded to steal from the garage. 
     
      
    10 The second offence on the indictment (also aggravated break, enter and steal) was committed during the early hours of 6 May 2002, in Vaucluse. The applicant climbed onto the balcony of a residential apartment, to which he gained access by opening an unlocked window. The owners were asleep inside. The applicant stole $270 in cash and a computer. He left through the front door. 
     
      
    11 The third offence on the indictment was committed during the same night, also in Vaucluse. The applicant entered an apartment via an open balcony door. The owners were present and asleep. He stole a computer and left the apartment by unlocking and opening the front door. (This was the offence of aggravated stealing and breaking out of premises.) 
     
      
    12 The fourth offence (aggravated steal and break out) was committed on 12 March 2003, at a little after 11.00 pm. The applicant entered a residence at Mosman, through an open rear door. The occupant was present, asleep. The applicant searched the residence and stole $1,000, a camera and camera equipment valued at $10,000, and a set of keys, which he used to steal another Mercedes Benz vehicle, valued at $400,000. 
     
      
    13 He drove off but crashed the vehicle into a kerb, damaging the vehicle. 
     
      
    14 The fifth offence was committed during the afternoon of 12 June 2003. In company with three other males, the applicant attended a Commonwealth Bank in Leichhardt. The men were in possession of a stolen BMW vehicle. One of the men (not the applicant) was armed with a sledgehammer. All were disguised. The applicant was wearing a baseball cap, a bandana, and a latex glove. The other men were wearing balaclavas. 
     
      
    15 One or more of the men demanded that staff and customers lie on the floor. Using the sledgehammer, they began to smash their way into the tellers’ area. They were unable to gain entry. Bank staff called police. One of the men was in possession of a police scanner. Presumably because he became aware that police were in the vicinity, he told the others that it was necessary to leave. All men ran off, and drove away in the stolen BMW. (This was the offence of attempted robbery in company.) 
     
      
    16 The final offence on the indictment (aggravated attempted carjacking) was committed on the same day, in the course of the men making their escape. The BMW was driven the wrong way into a one-way street in Glebe. The men blocked the passage of another vehicle in the street, then being driven by a woman. One of the offenders alighted from the BMW, approached the other vehicle, produced a knife, and ordered the driver to open the door. Using his elbow, he smashed the passenger-side window. Police drove into the street with lights and sirens activated. One of the offenders drove the BMW into the other vehicle, narrowly missing the driver. The BMW was damaged and undrivable. The offenders ran off, in different directions. The applicant ran into a construction site. There he discarded the latex glove, the baseball cap and the bandana. He ran off. 
     
      
    17 By reason of DNA evidence located on the contents of the stolen, damaged and abandoned BMW, and on the latex glove, and of video footage of the robbery in the Leichhardt Bank, the applicant was identified as a suspect. He was arrested following a police pursuit on 17 December 2003. When interviewed, the applicant denied having been present at the bank robbery. He refused to state where he had obtained money (a sum of $258.25) that was in his possession on arrest. He was also in possession of a Commodore car key. He claimed to have found it in a street that morning. 
     
      
    18 Four of the offences listed on the Form 1 were committed in association with offences on the indictment. Two were of taking and driving conveyances without consent; these related to the two Mercedes Benz vehicles taken by the applicant in the process of the Mosman offences. The offence of allowing himself to be carried in a conveyance knowing it to have been stolen was constituted by his being present in the stolen BMW, used in the attempted bank robbery; the goods in custody was constituted by his possession of the Holden Commodore car key and cash, on the occasion of his arrest. The remaining Form 1 offence, of break and enter with intent to steal, was committed during the evening of 17 August 2003 or the early morning of the following day. The applicant broke and entered a retail shopping complex with intent to steal. 
     
      
       
      Proceedings on sentence 
       
      
    19 The applicant entered a plea of guilty to all charges on 27 August 2004 in the Central Local Court. He was re-indicted, with minor amendments, more than a year later, on 9 December 2005. The reason for the long delay is not apparent. Sentence proceedings took place on that date. The applicant gave evidence. Also before the court was a pre-sentence report and a clinical psychological assessment, prepared by Dr Susan Hayes. The applicant expressed regret for his criminal behaviour. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    20 From the material put before the sentencing judge the following emerges. The applicant was born on 1 January 1980, in Fiji, one of six (or seven) children. He was 22 and 23 at the time of these offences. His mother was a school teacher, his father a forestry worker. His father was an alcoholic who violently physically assaulted the applicant’s mother. She eventually left him and moved to Sydney. The applicant remained in Fiji for a time, but eventually joined his mother in Sydney at about the age of eight. Other children were at boarding school, and one was adopted.  
     
      
    21 The applicant took up residence in Sydney with his mother, her de facto, one brother and one sister. He was still living with his mother at the time of his arrest. He found schooling in Sydney difficult, because, on his arrival, he spoke little English. He was teased, bullied and beaten. He dropped out of school at the age of 14. 
     
      
    22 He had a number of unskilled jobs. His criminal record shows that his first criminal conviction was in July 1997 (when he was aged 17) and involved unauthorised use of motor vehicles and driving whilst unlicensed. However, the pre-sentence report records that his criminal behaviour began earlier than that, in 1993, at the age of 13, when he was fined for offences of malicious damage and possessing an offensive implement. There were, according to the report, other appearances in the Children’s Court, for offences as serious as drugs, robbery and motor vehicle offences. A number of other convictions appear on his criminal history, for offences including drive in a manner dangerous, another of unlicensed driving, goods in custody, receiving, break, enter and steal, and malicious damage to property. The applicant began using cannabis at the age of 15, and alcohol at 16. He fell into bad company and this was what led to his criminal behaviour. 
     
      
    23 In early 2003, a cousin to whom he was very close died in a car accident, and was, on autopsy, found to have a large brain tumour. This death triggered heavy drug and alcohol use in the applicant. He had also taken up heroin use. His health was poor. 
     
      
    24 After administering tests, Dr Hayes concluded that the applicant suffered from a mild intellectual disability. She agreed with his own self assessment, that he was easily led and wanted very much to belong to a peer group, but the peer group would accept him only if he joined in its criminal activities. His intellectual disability meant that he was more easily led than would otherwise be the case. He had low self-esteem, as a result of his intellectual disability, and also, possibly, of his family circumstances, and the impact of having been teased and bullied at school. 
     
      
    25 Dr Hayes considered his prospects for rehabilitation to be good, provided that he abstained from drugs and alcohol; and that, on release, he would need support and supervision. 
     
      
       
      The remarks on sentence  
       
      
    26 The sentencing judge recounted the facts of the offences. In respect of the offences numbered 4 and 6, as to which the provisions of Part 4, Division 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act apply, he noted that the pleas of guilty rendered the standard non-parole period strictly inapplicable, but, correctly, recognised that it remained as an indicator of the intention of the legislature in relation to sentencing for such offences. 
     
      
    27 He noted that the offences numbered 1, 2 and 3 were committed whilst the applicant was on bail in respect of other offences and recognised this, again correctly, to be a serious aggravating feature. He noted the applicant’s criminal record, including the multiple offences of break, enter and steal and of dishonesty. 
     
      
    28 He expressly accepted the applicant’s expressions of remorse as genuine. He noted the pleas of guilty, and that they were entered at the earliest reasonable opportunity, and stated his intention of applying the “maximum discount”. This may be taken to be a reference to the 25% at the top of the range promulgated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. His Honour referred to totality and stated that the need to accommodate the totality of the offending in appropriate overall sentences required some degree of accumulation of the sentences to be imposed. He stated that, absent the pleas of guilty, he considered that a full term of imprisonment for 15 years to be appropriate to the level of criminality involved. Thus (after deducting 25% in recognition of the guilty pleas) he arrived at a total head sentence of 11 years and three months. He noted the applicant’s relative youth, and his efforts to reform and his claim to have ceased taking drugs. He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view there are good reasons in this case to find special circumstances and I will make such a finding.” 
        
       
      
    29 This was a reference to s44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ““44(2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).” 
        
       
      
    30 In my opinion, this remark plainly indicated an intention to vary the statutory proportion stated in s44(2) by reducing the non-parole period and extending the balance of term. It is his implementation (or otherwise) of this intention that gives rise to one of the grounds of appeal. His Honour then imposed the sentences I have set out above. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal 
       
      
    31 Two grounds were pleaded and argued in support of the application. They were: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 1. His Honour in making a finding of special circumstances failed to properly reflect that finding in the non-parole period imposed. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2. The overall sentence and effective non-parole period is manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1: special circumstances 
       
      
    32 In respect of the individual sentences, his Honour, in varying degrees, put into effect his expressed intention of varying the statutory ratio in favour of the applicant. However, when he accumulated the sentences, this was all but undone. In the overall sentence as imposed, the non-parole period is 73% of the total sentence – just 2% less than the statutory formulation. Unless (as is sometimes the case in sentencing an offender in respect of multiple offences to cumulative or partially cumulative terms) the purpose of a finding of special circumstances is to restore, to the total term of the combined sentences, the statutory proportions, a finding of special circumstances is of no benefit to the offender, unless it is applied not only to individual sentences, but, much more importantly, to the total, or overall, term. In my opinion it is clear that here the accumulation process distorted the result that his Honour intended to achieve. This should be corrected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: manifestly excessive 
       
      
    33 A number of matters were advanced in support of the argument that the overall sentence was manifestly excessive. It was explicitly conceded that no individual sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    34 Reliance was placed upon the similarity of the offences that involved dwelling houses and stealing therein – four of the six offences on the indictment. Two of them, it was observed, were committed on the same night. In all cases, the occupants of the homes were asleep. In reliance upon my own decision in R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66, it was argued that these similar features should have pointed towards concurrency rather than accumulation. 
     
      
    35 This represents a misunderstanding (though, perhaps, an understandable one) of what was said in Hammoud. Each of these six offences was quite discrete. They were not committed as part of a single criminal enterprise, which is what I had in mind when I made the remarks in Hammoud. Nothing that was said in Hammoud requires or justifies a finding in this case that accumulation rather then concurrency was erroneous. 
     
      
    36 It was also pointed out that, while the applicant was party to a joint criminal enterprise in respect of the fifth and sixth offences, he was not the offender who wielded the sledgehammer, and was not the offender who went to the victim’s car. This may be so, but, again, in my opinion, it would not justify a finding that the judge was in error in his approach to the facts of the offences. 
     
      
    37 A further argument concerned the evidence of intellectual disability. It was pointed out that, during the proceedings on sentence, the sentencing judge expressed some surprise at this conclusion of Dr Hayes, in such a way as to suggest disagreement. However, his Honour nowhere rejected the conclusion. Indeed, he made no reference to the conclusion in his remarks on sentence. But, in any event, it was accepted that his intellectual functioning did not reduce his moral culpability; it was, rather, submitted that, in such circumstances, general deterrence is of less relevance. This is a well-known principle: see R v Champion (1992) 64 A Crim R 244; R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. But I find nothing in the remarks on sentence nor the approach of his Honour to indicate that the evidence of the applicant’s intellectual disability was not given due weight in the circumstances. I am not persuaded that the sentences, in total, were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    38 However, for the reasons I have already given, I am satisfied that there was error in the structure of the sentences following the finding of s44 special circumstances. Accordingly, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed to that extent, and one sentence varied to yield an overall non-parole period of seven and a half years, which would mean a balance of term of three years and nine months, the total term remaining at eleven years and three months. Regrettably, the only way that I can see to achieve this is to reduce the non-parole period imposed in respect of the most serious of the offences (the attempted armed robbery in company) that resulted in the longest sentence. I say this is regrettable because it will give the impression of a non-parole period imposed in respect of a serious offence that is quite disproportionate to the gravity of the offence, and will not, on its face, comply with the requirements of Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. In the context of all offences and sentences, however, what I propose will yield a just result, and give effect to the finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    39 Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) leave to appeal be granted; the appeal allowed; 
       
       
      (ii) the sentence imposed in respect of Count 5 be quashed; 
       
       
      (iii) in respect of Count 5, the applicant be re-sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of one year and six months, commencing on 17 December 2009 and expiring on 16 June 2011, with a balance of term of three years and nine months, expiring on 16 March 2015.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant Douglas William Rowney was tried in relation to the following counts: 
     
      
       
      Six counts of sexual intercourse with a person under ten years and under the age of sixteen years being an offence against s 66C(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (counts 1, 2, 4, 5 6, and 7); and 
       
       
      One count of indecent assault with a person above the age of ten years and under the age of sixteen years being an offence contrary to s 61E(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (count 3). 
       
      
    2 At the close of the Crown case the trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal in relation to counts 2, 5 and 6. The jury returned verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 1, 3, 4 and 7.  
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against his conviction and raises two grounds of appeal. I shall return to the precise grounds of appeal later in these reasons. 
     
      
       
      The course of the trial 
       
      
    4 Each of the counts with which the appellant was charged was concerned with allegations that he had engaged in sexual activity with the complainant who turned thirteen in February 1988. The counts in respect of which guilty verdicts were returned related to incidents which allegedly occurred between 1 September 1987 and 31 January 1988 at locations near Gunnedah. Counts 1, 3 and 4 related to events which allegedly occurred at Kelvin and count 7 to events which allegedly occurred at Manilla. The incidents were alleged to have occurred when both the appellant’s family and the complainant’s family were living, in separate houses, on a property called “Rangari”, near Gunnedah.  
     
      
    5 Counts 1 and 2 allegedly occurred at “Carter’s Bridge”. The Crown Prosecutor in his opening address said in relation to these counts: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence will establish, I expect, that there was an occasion at that time when the accused had the complainant take down her pants and then he licked her on the vagina, following which he inserted his fingers into the complainant’s vagina.” 
        
       
      
    6 The complainant gave evidence that on one occasion the appellant drove her in his Suzuki 4WD to a location under the bridge. She said that she was sitting in the passenger seat and the appellant was “licking my vagina.” She said that he was out of the car with her legs over his shoulders. The complainant said that it was “warm … spring, summer” and the incident occurred before 1 January 1988. 
     
      
    7 The complainant described Carter’s Bridge as having “wooden rails and it was tar going over the top of it.” She said it was made of “cement, wood, tar.” There was an issue at the trial as to whether the complainant had correctly identified Carter’s Bridge. At the trial Mr Carter gave evidence in which he said that the bridge had been named after his father and was constructed in the early 1970’s. He said that its appearance had not changed since it was constructed. He said the bridge was a two lane bridge in which the railings were made of rolled hollow steel. He said “a single lane bridge with a tarred surface” would not fit the description of the bridge.” 
     
      
    8 The complainant gave evidence consistent with Count 1 as alleged by the Crown but she did not say that the appellant had inserted his finger into her vagina. Accordingly, the trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal in relation to count 2 where this was an essential element. 
     
      
    9 Counts 3 and 4 were alleged to have occurred after the appellant and the complainant had been to Gunnedah to buy ammunition. The complainant said that they went to a shop named “Dowsett’s” at Gunnedah to buy bullets. On the way back to “Rangari”, the appellant allegedly pulled over to the side of a dirt road after they had passed over a little bridge. There was no one else around. The complainant said that the appellant got “cranky” with her and she “sucked his penis.” The incident allegedly occurred in the car and she had to lean over to do it. She said that his penis was hard and that he ejaculated on himself. She also touched his penis during this incident which she said occurred when there was no one else present. 
     
      
    10 Count 5 was the subject of a directed verdict. The relevant incident was alleged to have occurred before 31 January 1988. However, the evidence tendered at the trial did not support this allegation. The complainant said that she was thirteen at the time of the incident. However, her thirteenth birthday was on 24 February 1988. Although the appellant was acquitted it is necessary to relate the essential elements of the evidence tendered on this count. 
     
      
    11 The complainant said that she went to the appellant’s family house and stayed the night. She said the appellant gave her some stamps and she later had dinner with the appellant and his parents. She said that the appellant took her into his bedroom and when she was lying on her back kissed her and then put his penis into her vagina. She said that it hurt and that she got up. She said that she thought she saw blood and “Doug was yelling at me like I did something wrong.” She said that she spent the night in the appellant’s bed. 
     
      
    12 The complainant said that the incident occurred when she was thirteen and took place more than twelve months after the appellant’s father had left the property. When cross-examined she said there was another occasion when her brother also stayed the night at the appellant’s house and they slept on the lounge. She said that she had permission from her mother to stay overnight. When challenged she insisted that she had stayed the night at the appellant’s place.  
     
      
    13 The complainant’s brother gave evidence but did not say that there was an occasion when he stayed overnight at the appellant’s house with his sister. The complainant’s mother also gave evidence to the effect that the complainant had never spent the night at the appellant’s house and that she would never have given her permission to do so. The appellant’s mother said that there was never any occasion when the complainant came alone or stayed overnight at her house. 
     
      
    14 Count 6 was also the subject of a directed verdict. In his opening address the Crown prosecutor told the jury that the sixth count “relates to an incident when both the complainant and the accused were riding the accused’s motorcycle” on a property owned by another person. The Crown prosecutor when opening in relation to this count said: 
     
      
       
        
        “They eventually came to an area near a dry creek bed and on that occasion I expect she will tell you that the accused licked her on the vagina. That is the act of sexual intercourse that we are seeking to rely upon to establish count 6.” 
        
       
      
    15 Although the Crown Prosecutor had opened to the effect that sexual activity had taken place on this occasion, when asked about the incident on the motorbike the complainant said “Doug wanted to do things, I didn’t want to, we got back on the bike.” She said that “nothing’ happened on that occasion and accordingly a direction of acquittal was inevitable. 
     
      
    16 Count 7 related to an allegation that the appellant penetrated the complainant with his penis, although not completely, during a swimming trip to Manilla weir. The complainant said that she had gone with the appellant and her brother to the weir and she and the appellant were sitting under a waterfall. In her evidence she said that “Doug wanted me to sit on his lap.” She said that she “faced Doug and put my legs around him and sat on his lap.” She said that his penis was hard and went into the lips of her vagina but it would not go in.  
     
      
    17 The complainant’s brother gave evidence in which he said that he remembered a time when he went to the weir with the appellant and his sister. He said that the appellant and his sister were swimming together “under there” a reference to a waterfall. He gave evidence that at no time on this occasion did the complainant tell him that anything was wrong. He said that he could not remember telling the police on two occasions that at the time of this incident he was fourteen and the complainant was thirteen. 
     
      
    18 When cross-examined the complainant said that she could not remember if there was a waterfall but said that “there was a fair bit of water washing over.” She gave evidence that at no time during the incident was she sitting with her back to the appellant. The following passage was then read to her from her police statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “Rowney just grabbed me by the left wrist and pulled me towards him. He placed me on his lap with my back towards him.” 
        
       
      
    19 She said she could not remember saying those words to the police but said that she could clearly remember the incident in the terms she recounted to the jury. 
     
      
    20 Throughout her evidence the complainant stated that sexual activity continued with the appellant from when she was twelve to when she was fifteen years of age. She said that sexual activity occurred in each of those years. She denied that the appellant and his family moved away from the area shortly after her thirteenth birthday. This was inconsistent with the Crown case in which evidence was tendered that the appellant moved away almost immediately after her thirteenth birthday. 
     
      
    21 The evidence of the appellant’s former employer was that the appellant ceased employment with him on or before 27 February 1988. This was confirmed from the employer’s employment records. Although he had previously seen them together the employer did not recall seeing the appellant with the complainant after 26 February 1988. He said that at no time did the appellant and the complainant give an indication that they were sexually involved. The complainant’s brother gave evidence that he did not think his sister and the appellant associated at all after the appellant and his family left the area.  
     
      
    22 The complainant has a history of difficulty with alcohol and drugs. When cross-examined she accepted that she had overdosed on prescription medicine at the age of 16. She had also used marijuana heavily from the age of 16. She accepted that she had used amphetamines “for years.” In the year 2000 she was admitted to the Jordan Centre in Coffs Harbour. She denied that she had ever heard voices or experienced seeing things that were not in fact there. However, medical notes obtained from the Jordan Centre suggest that from time to time she has experienced these difficulties.  
     
      
    23 The appellant did not give evidence but when he was interviewed by the police denied the allegations. A record of his interview was tendered at the trial. The defence emphasised that the complainant had not complained about the actions of the appellant until more than 13 years after the alleged events and her evidence was uncorroborated. The defence also emphasised that in a number of respects the complainant did not “come up to proof.” There were inconsistencies in her version of some events. She was adamant that sexual acts continued until she was fifteen even though, on the Crown case, the appellant left the area within days of her thirteenth birthday.  
     
      
       
      Ground one: the trial judge erred in rejecting evidence of the finding of a note by the complainant’s mother and the complainant’s explanation of the note to her mother. 
       
      
    24 This ground of appeal is concerned with evidence from the complainant’s mother given on the voir dire and ultimately rejected by the trial judge. She said that when the complainant was about fourteen years old she found a note in her school uniform when she was checking her pockets prior to doing the washing. In her statement she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was a note in her uniform from her friend called C. I don’t remember the last name. In the note it said, ‘At least I didn’t sleep with a 25 year old when I was 13.’ I called [the complainant’s step father] in and showed him the note and [he] told me that he didn’t want to be present when [I] spoke to the complainant. I spoke to the complainant about this note and wanted her to explain the note. I asked her if the note was true and she said, ‘Yes.’ She had her head down when she said this and said, ‘I’ve been raped.’ [The complainant] wouldn’t tell me who the person was. I told her that I was going to ring the police. She said, ‘I’ve lied I haven’t been raped.’ I told her I wanted to know what the note was about. [The complainant] said ‘C and me were driving around town with two fellows and C was having sex with one of the fellows and [the complainant] said that she then started to have sex with the other fellow who was about 25 years old. [The complainant] said that it hurt and asked him to stop but he wouldn’t. The complainant would not tell me the name of this fellow. The complainant then told me that she had made the story up about [her stepfather] because she thought she was going to get pregnant when she had sex with the 25 year old.” 
        
       
      
    25 In a later statement made on 15 August 2003 the complainant’s mother referred to the fact that the complainant had been admitted to the Jordan Centre. She said that she rang her there a few times and on one occasion the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was Doug that broke my virginity.’ In the conversation I spoke to [the complainant] about the note that I had found in her school uniform when she was about 14 years old. [The complainant] said ‘that’s what the note was written about.’"" 
        
       
      
    26 The reference to Doug in this later conversation indicates that the complainant told her mother that it was the appellant who “broke” her virginity. The reference to the note also suggests that the note related in some way to the appellant. However, whether the complainant was telling her mother that she lost her virginity in the car or that the happenings in the car were merely an incidence of continuing sexual activity is not clear. Whatever be the correct understanding of this conversation it was not favourable to the appellant. Although not evidence which was relevant to any particular charge, if it had been admitted, it was evidence of sexual activity between the appellant and the complainant when she was no more than fourteen years old. 
     
      
    27 The conversation referred to in the earlier statement is also ambiguous. The statement that the author of the note did not sleep with a twenty-five year old when she was thirteen carries the inference that the complainant did do so. When considered together with the later conversation an available inference would be that the appellant and the complainant engaged in sexual activity when she was thirteen. Again, although not related to any particular charge this is unlikely to have assisted the defence case. 
     
      
    28 The mother’s account of the earlier conversation also shows a propensity in the complainant to lie. The lie is said to be justified out of a concern that she may be embarrassed if she fell pregnant. An allegation that she had been raped would explain that eventuality should it occur. However, when her mother said she would tell the police, the complainant apparently appreciated she could not sustain the lie and withdrew the allegation of rape. There may be other explanations for this part of the exchange. One suggestion is that she was protecting her stepfather. However, this would also indicate a propensity to tell lies. 
     
      
    29 Counsel for the appellant at his trial sought to tender the evidence from the statements and to cross-examine the complainant about these matters. However, after giving consideration to s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 the trial judge ruled against the appellant. Section 293 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. 
         
         
        (2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible.

        (4) Subsection (3) does not apply:  
         
         
        (a) if the evidence:

          (b) if the evidence relates to a relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant, 
          
         
         
          
          (c) if:  
           
            
            (i) the accused person is alleged to have had sexual intercourse (as defined in section 61H (1) of the Crimes Act 1900) with the complainant, and the accused person does not concede the sexual intercourse so alleged, and 
             
            (ii) the evidence is relevant to whether the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease or injury is attributable to the sexual intercourse alleged to have been had by the accused person, 
            
           
          
         
         
        (d) if the evidence is relevant to:  
         
          
           
            
            (i) whether at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence there was present in the complainant a disease that, at any relevant time, was absent in the accused person, or

          (e) if the evidence is relevant to whether the allegation that the prescribed sexual offence was committed by the accused person was first made following a realisation or discovery of the presence of pregnancy or disease in the complainant (being a realisation or discovery that took place after the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence), 
          
         
         
          
          (f) if the evidence has been given by the complainant in cross-examination by or on behalf of the accused person, being evidence given in answer to a question that may, pursuant to subsection (6), be asked, 
          
         
         and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. 
         
         
        (5) A witness must not be asked:

          (b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible. 
          
         
         
        (6) If the court is satisfied:

            (i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or 
             
            (ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication, 
           
          the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified. 
          
         
         
        (7) On the trial of a person, any question as to the admissibility of evidence under subsection (2) or (3) or the right to cross-examine under subsection (6) is to be decided by the court in the absence of the jury. 
         
         
        (8) If the court decides that evidence is admissible under subsection (4), the court must, before the evidence is given, record or cause to be recorded in writing the nature and scope of the evidence that is so admissible and the reasons for that decision. 
         
         
        (9) (Repealed)” 
        
       
      
    30 From her short reasons it would seem that her Honour understood that the application was founded on the proposition that in the earlier conversation between the complainant and her mother, the complainant was alleging inappropriate sexual conduct by her stepfather. Counsel for the appellant said that he proposed to put to the complainant that the true position was that she had been raped by her stepfather and the activities in the car in truth had nothing to do with the appellant. The submission was apparently to be reinforced by the fact that the complainant had made a complaint in relation to the stepfather to the school counsellor. It was submitted that notwithstanding the exclusion in s 293(2) the evidence was admissible pursuant to s 293(4)(a).  
     
      
    31 The appellant’s counsel also made written application at the trial for leave to adduce the evidence contained in the statements and to cross-examine the complainant. That application was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The accused applies for leave under s 293(4)(a) and 293(4)(c) to adduce evidence of the complainant’s sexual activity or a lack of sexual activity contained in 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) Statement of Helen Eason dated 6 March 2002 in relation to Dale Collins (the whole statement). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Statement of Hazel Collins dated 21 May 2002 paragraphs 13-19, 22, 24 & 26. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) Statement of Hazel Collins dated 15 August 2003 paragraph 6. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. It is disclosed or implied in the prosecution case the accused is a person (not named) with whom the complainant had sexual activity when she was 13 years of age referred to in a note found in the school uniform of the complainant when she was 14 years of age. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The accused applies for leave under s 293(6) the complainant be cross-examined on his behalf in relation to the above disclosures or implications.” 
        
       
      
    32 When rejecting the evidence the trial judge stated that it was not made admissible by s 293(4)(a). She also determined that in any event “its probative value is not, in my view, one which would outweigh any distress humiliation or embarrassment the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission.” Her Honour did not explain the basis for either finding. 
     
      
    33 The matter was approached differently on the appeal when it was submitted that rather than being understood as evidence of sexual reputation, which s 293 made inadmissible, “it should have been put forward as evidence of complaint, inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence at trial.” In particular it was submitted that because the complainant did not give evidence of having sex with the appellant when driving with her friend and another man, the appellant should have been allowed to tender the evidence and cross-examine the complainant in relation to it. It was further submitted that the rejected evidence indicated that the complainant had told her mother that she had lost her virginity when she was thirteen when she had intercourse in a car. This was said to be inconsistent with the fact that the complainant had reported that she “thought she saw blood” as part of the events comprising count 5, which suggested she lost her virginity on that occasion. Accordingly, it was submitted that the note and the conversation, if admitted, would have “severely undermined” the complainant’s credibility. 
     
      
    34 Although inconsistent with the basis of the tender advanced in the written application, when the basis for the tender was confined to that reflected in her Honour’s reasons it was inevitable that the evidence would be rejected. If the basis of the tender was confined to evidence relating to allegations of sexual assault which the complainant had made against her stepfather, there is no limb of s 293(4) which would allow its admission. In any event there was evidence that this event was alleged to have occurred on 20 March 1988, the complaint in relation to the stepfather being made on 21 March. This was at a time which was beyond the time period identified in the indictment. 
     
      
    35 However, if the admitted portions of the statements, including the reference to the note, were confined to references to sexual activity between the appellant and the complainant, the evidence would have been admissible pursuant to s 293(4)(b), provided its probative value outweighed any distress, humiliation or embarrassment to the complainant. The evidence would relate to a “relationship between the accused person and the complainant.” 
     
      
    36 The admission of this evidence would have carried significant dangers for the appellant. Although the statements suggested sexual activity between the appellant and the complainant when she was thirteen – this is the assertion of the author of the note and not the complainant. The author may well have been mistaken as to the complainant’s age. If the cross-examiner had sought to use the note and the account of the conversation, it would inevitably confirm sexual activity between the complainant and the appellant contrary to the statute, although, perhaps not within the time period included on the indictment. 
     
      
    37 It is important to appreciate that the fundamental assertion which the complainant made is that contained in the second conversation when she says “he (the appellant) broke my virginity.” That allegation is, at the very least, not inconsistent with the allegations of sexual activity at the trial. Although the conversations and the note admit of the inference that she lost her virginity in the events in the car this is not the inevitable inference. It would be unlikely that the alleged events as charged and in respect of which the appellant was convicted of the licking of her vagina, the sucking of the appellant’s penis or, even, the attempt at penetration would be described by the complainant as “breaking her virginity.” Perhaps count 5, which alleged that the appellant put his penis into her vagina when it hurt “and she thought she saw blood”, could have been described by her as the occasion when she lost her virginity, although this may not be the case. If blood was present this could have been due to a vigorous attempt at penetration. She did not give evidence that this was the occasion when her virginity was lost. In any event the allegation in count 5 was of sexual intercourse when the complainant was thirteen and it was for this reason that a verdict of acquittal on this count was directed.  
     
      
    38 In my opinion it was not appropriate to exclude the evidence by reason of the potential distress, humiliation or embarrassment to the complainant. If the contents of the conversation which was admitted was confined to evidence relating to the appellant it would only confirm sexual activity between the complainant and the appellant of which she had already given evidence. In so far as the evidence shows that she lied to her mother, although embarrassing, this is not a matter with which the section is concerned. 
     
      
    39 In these circumstances I am satisfied that provided it was confined to evidence relating to the relationship between the complainant and the appellant the tendered material should have been admitted. However, the ultimate question is whether the exclusion of the evidence has cost the appellant a chance of an acquittal. I do not believe it has. If admitted, the evidence would have suggested that the complainant and the appellant had sexual relations at least when she was thirteen, which was otherwise consistent with her evidence. Although it would also have demonstrated that she was prepared to lie, the reason for the lie, to save her from the embarrassment of having become pregnant after an act of consensual intercourse, was understandable. It would not indicate that she had necessarily lied about other and earlier sexual activity, the subject of the counts on which the appellant was convicted. 
     
      
    40 The submission which the appellant made, which was obviously correct, is that the allegation which the complainant made at the time, of sexual intercourse with the appellant when the complainant was thirteen, was inconsistent with the Crown case that the appellant had moved away from the area within two days of the complainant attaining thirteen years. However, this difficulty in the Crown case is not only apparent in the rejected evidence. The complainant asserted continuing sexual intercourse with the appellant when she was aged thirteen, fourteen and fifteen. Accordingly, the jury had to resolve the issue of the complainant’s credibility having regard to these assertions. The exchange with her mother, which the judge rejected, would have added further evidence of sexual intercourse after the complainant turned thirteen and the jury may have inferred that this was between the complainant and the appellant. If this was the case the evidence may have served to have bolstered the complainant’s credit rather than detract from it. Ultimately, I do not believe that by reason of the failure to admit this evidence the appellant lost a chance of an acquittal. 
     
      
    41 Accordingly, it is necessary to consider the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground two – the verdicts were unreasonable being incapable of being supported by the evidence 
       
      
    42 In support of this ground the appellant relied upon the following matters: 
     
      
    · The lack of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence 
     
      
    · Delay in complaint – more than 13 years 
     
      
    · The fact that the complainant’s evidence was inconsistent with the Crown prosecutor’s opening address in many respects resulting in directed verdicts on counts 2, 5 and 6. 
     
      
    · In relation to counts 1 and 2, the misdescription by the complainant of “Carter’s Bridge” and her failure to mention count 2 as forming part of the Carter’s Bridge incident. 
     
      
    · In relation to count 5, the inconsistencies between the complainant’s evidence that she was present alone overnight in the appellant’s bedroom and the evidence of the complainant’s mother and Valmai Rowney that she never went to the Rowney house alone or stayed overnight. 
     
      
    · The fact that the complainant said “that nothing happened” in relation to count 6 (the motorbike incident) notwithstanding the Crown’s opening. 
     
      
    · In relation to count 7 (the Manilla weir incident), the inconsistency between the complainant’s evidence that she was facing the appellant during the incident, at no stage with her back to the appellant, and her statement to police that he placed her on his lap with her back to him when the incident occurred. 
     
      
    · The complainant’s drug and alcohol history, her history of reporting hearing voices and seeing things that were not there including telling staff at the Jordan Centre about hearing voices. These matters were submitted to seriously undermine credibility because they indicated that the complainant was delusional or at the very least had lied to staff at the Jordan Centre about being delusional. 
     
      
    · The fact that the complainant was adamant that the sexual activity with the appellant continued when she was thirteen, fourteen and fifteen, being a time after which the Rowney’s had moved away from where the complainant lived. It was submitted that this seriously undermined her credibility. 
     
      
    · If the evidence about the note found in the complainant’s school uniform (which was submitted to be evidence of inconsistent complaint) had been allowed, the complainant’s credibility would have been further significantly undermined. 
     
      
    43 The principles which this Court must apply when it is submitted that a verdict is unreasonable are well known. Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court on any appeal under s 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court at trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    44 The relevant tests were explained in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, … 
        
       
       
        
        If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence …"" 
        
       
      
    45 In R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The test for an unreasonable verdict – whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty – must be applied to the whole of the facts in the circumstances of a particular case.” [31] 
        
       
      
    46 Markuleski was subsequently approved in MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 and R v Rose (2002) 55 NSWLR 701. 
     
      
    47 Apart from the complaint in relation to evidence with respect to the conversation between the complainant and her mother, the subject of ground one in this appeal, no other complaint is made about the conduct of the trial and the rulings of the trial judge. The jury was directed that they are the sole judges of the facts and that it was for them to decide whether witnesses were telling the truth. They were told that the evidence of the complainant was crucial and should be scrutinised very carefully. They were also informed that, if they had a reasonable doubt in respect of more than one count, this had to be taken into account when assessing the complainant’s evidence in respect of the other counts. The jury were directed about the difficulties created by delay and given warnings in accordance with the requirements identified in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79.  
     
      
    48 With respect to the complaint that there was a lack of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence, this is, of course, not unusual in sexual assault cases and was identified by the trial judge as a matter for the jury’s consideration. It could not alone justify a finding that the verdict was unreasonable. 
     
      
    49 With respect to the inconsistencies between the complainant’s evidence and the Crown opening these matters were obvious and were emphasised by defence counsel. The jury were told that this was the reason why verdicts were being directed in relation to counts 2 and 6. With respect to count 5 the evidence disclosed an act of intercourse outside the time provided in the indictment. As a result the verdict was directed in circumstances which again would have been plain to the jury. 
     
      
    50 The various inconsistencies which the appellant identified in the complainant’s evidence were all known to the jury. In particular the inconsistency about her position in the alleged Manilla weir incident was the subject of extensive examination and referred to in address. The jury were also reminded of the inconsistency between the complainant’s evidence and the Crown case with respect to her allegation of sexual activity when she was aged thirteen to fifteen. 
     
      
    51 With respect to more general matters, including the complainant’s drug and alcohol history, these were all prominent issues in the trial from which the jury were able to form an appreciation of her credibility. It will often be the case that when allegations are made of sexual activity with a young person occurring many years ago the recollection of detail will be imprecise. Furthermore, if in the intervening years a complainant has suffered significant psychiatric illness requiring treatment a memory of the sequence and timing of particular events may be difficult. However, these were all matters falling for assessment by the jury. My review of the evidence does not leave me with a concern that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted. 
     
      
    52 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    53 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I do not propose to prolong these remarks by restating the background or the Crown allegations. I rely upon his Honour’s account of the facts. I wish only to make my own observations in relation to the first ground of appeal. I agree with McClellan CJ at CL, for reasons his Honour gives, that Ground 2 ought to be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
       
      In my opinion this ground of appeal is entirely misconceived, as has been the approach to the evidence the subject of the ground from start to finish. In order to explain this view it is necessary that I state, as briefly as possible, the relevant evidence and circumstances. 
       
      
    54 Prior to the commencement of the trial that resulted in the appellant’s conviction, an earlier trial began but, for reasons that are not clear to me and do not need to be explored, aborted. It was during that trial that the application was made on behalf of the appellant to adduce the evidence in question. The evidence then in question fell into two categories: firstly, evidence that the complainant had also made accusations of sexual misconduct against her mother’s partner (to whom it is convenient to refer, somewhat inaccurately, as the complainant’s stepfather); and, secondly, evidence of a note apparently written to the complainant by a friend, and found in the complainant’s clothing by her mother, together with evidence of conversations that followed that discovery. 
     
      
    55 It is the latter evidence that is the subject of the first ground of appeal. (Since it is not relevant to the grounds of appeal, it is not necessary to be concerned with the evidence concerning the complainant’s accusations against her stepfather.) 
     
      
    56 It is not at all easy to identify the basis upon which trial counsel sought to have the evidence admitted, and it is no easier to identify the quite different basis upon which appellate counsel now contends that the evidence ought to have been admitted. 
     
      
    57 The evidence is most conveniently to be found in a statement made by the complainant’s mother on 21 May 2002, and in a later statement made by her on 15 August 2003. 
     
      
    58 In the earlier statement the complainant’s mother said that when the complainant was about 14 years of age, she found, in her school uniform, a note from a friend of the complainant, to whom I will refer as “C”. The note read: 
     
      
       
        
        “At least I didn’t sleep with a 25 year old when I was 13.” 
        
       
       
      (The complainant was born on 25 February 1975. She turned 13 on 25 February 1988. If she was 14 at the time the note was found, that event must have occurred between February 1989 and February 1900.)  
       
      
    59 The complainant’s mother stated that, on finding the note, she confronted the complainant, seeking an explanation. The complainant initially responded by saying that she had been raped, but refused to identify to her mother the person she said had raped her. Her mother told her that she intended to inform police, whereupon the complainant withdrew the allegation of rape. 
     
      
    60 Her mother’s statement continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I told her that I wanted to know what the note was about. [The complainant] said, ‘[C] and me were driving around town with two fellows and [C] was having sex with one of the fellows and [the complainant] said that she then started to have sex with the other fellow who was about 25 years old. [The complainant] said that it hurt and asked him to stop but he wouldn’t. [The complainant] wouldn’t tell me the name of this fellow. [The complainant] then told me that she had made the storey (sic) up about [the complainant’s stepfather] because she thought that she was going to get pregnant when she had sex with the 25 year old.” 
        
       
      
    61 In the later statement (made 15 August 2003) the complainant’s mother spoke of another conversation with the complainant. At the time of this conversation the complainant was a patient in a psychiatric institution. The nearest the complainant’s mother fixed the date of the admission to the psychiatric institution was “about three years” prior to the date she made her statement. That would make the admission, and the conversation, some time in 2000. The complainant’s mother recorded that the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was Doug that broke my virginity.” 
        
       
       
      The complainant’s mother went on: 
       
       
        
        “In the conversation I spoke to [the complainant] about the note that I had found in her school uniform when she was about 14 years old. [The complainant] said, ‘That’s what the note was written about.’” 
        
       
       
      The reference to “Doug” is clearly a reference to the appellant. What is now sought to be drawn from this on behalf of the appellant is an assertion by the complainant that, at the age of 13 (by the adoption of the content of the note), she had had a sexual experience with the appellant, at which time she had “lost her virginity”. For the purposes of the argument, it may be assumed that such an inference would have been open. 
       
      
    62 The Crown Prosecutor at trial made it clear that he did not intend to lead any of this evidence. Counsel for the appellant stated his intention of cross-examining the complainant on it. 
     
      
    63 The transcript of the debate that ensued is difficult to follow, in part because the participants do not appear to have differentiated between the proposed evidence concerning the complainant’s accusations against her stepfather and the evidence presently under consideration; and, in part, because counsel for the appellant never identified with any precision (or, indeed, at all) the basis upon which he contended that the evidence was admissible, the basis upon which he sought to have it admitted, or the interpretation he sought to place upon it - that is, what fact in issue, or fact relevant to a fact in issue, he contended, would be illuminated by the evidence. 
     
      
    64 Since the entire discussion proceeded on the basis that the admissibility of the evidence depended upon the application of s293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, it is convenient here to set out the relevant portions of that section. The whole of s293 is set out in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. It is unnecessary to do more than set out those parts of the section which are relevant to the argument, as it proceeded in the District Court. 
     
      
       
        
        “293 Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. 
         
         
        (2) … 
         
         
        (3) Evidence that discloses or implies: 
         
         
          
          (a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or 
           
          (b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity, 
           
          
         
        is inadmissible. 
         
         
        (4) Subsection (3) does not apply: 
         
         
          
          (a) if the evidence: 
           
           
           (i) is of the complainant’s sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and 
            
            
           (ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed, 
            
           
          (b) if the evidence relates to a relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant, 
           
           
          (c) … 
           
           
          (d) … 
           
           
          (e) … 
           
           
          (f) …,  
          
         
         
          
          and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. 
          
         
         
        (5) … 
         
         
        (6) If the court is satisfied: 
         
         
          
          (a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period: 
           
           (i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or 
            
           (ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and 
           
          
         
         
          
          (b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication, 
           
           
          the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified. 
          
         
         
        (7) … 
         
         
        (8) …” 
        
       
      
    65 Counsel who appeared for the appellant at trial said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I wish to make applications under section 293 of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
         and I have reduced those applications to writing your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    66 The terms of the written application are set out in paragraph [31] of the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. It specifies that it is made under s293(4), involving subparagraphs (a) and (c). (Since subparagraph (c) can have no conceivable relevance, I have not reproduced it.) The terms in which the application was made make it clear that counsel accepted that the evidence disclosed or implied that the complainant had had (or may have had) sexual experience, or participated in sexual activity, and was, accordingly (unless made admissible by a subsequent provision of s293) excluded by reason of s293(3). The applications referred to material contained in statements of the complainant (dated 6 March 2002), and her mother (dated 21 May 2002 and 15 August 2003), to which I have already referred. 
     
      
    67 A voir dire was conducted. The statements of the complainant’s mother dated 21 May 2002 and 15 August 2003 were tendered on the voir dire, as was a statement of the complainant dated 6 March 2002. Reference was also made to a statement of the complainant dated 28 April 2000. 
     
      
    68 Paragraph 2 of the application is puzzling. It is, clearly enough, intended to invoke the provisions of subs(6) of s293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. But to say (as is expressly said in paragraph 2) that it would be disclosed or implied in the Crown case that the appellant was a person with whom the complainant engaged in sexual activity at the age of 13 was to misstate the Crown case, as it was then proposed to be led. Each count in the indictment specified that the offence had been committed between 1 September 1987 and 31 January 1988. At all such times the complainant was 12 years of age. She did not turn 13 until 24 February 1988. Thus, it was erroneous to state that it would be disclosed or implied in the prosecution case that such activity had occurred between the appellant and the complainant when she was 13 years of age. The exception to s293(3) provided by subs(6) comes into effect only where it has been disclosed or implied in the Crown case that the complainant has, or has not, had sexual experience or has, or has not, taken part in sexual activity. (It is irrelevant that, at the time the debate took place no evidence had been given: the debate proceeded in anticipation of the evidence that had, no doubt, been fully disclosed to the defence.) It was, of course, fundamental to the Crown case that it would allege that sexual activity had occurred between the complainant and the appellant: that was the very essence of the case. Subs(6) is not, in my opinion, directed to the evidence of sexual activity that is intended to be the foundation of the Crown case: it is directed to evidence of other sexual activity or experience, or lack of sexual activity or experience, that emerges, or may be expected to emerge, incidentally, for some reason other than as the foundation of any charge, but that may, unless the complainant is permitted to be cross examined about that sexual activity or experience (or lack thereof), cause unfair prejudice to the accused person. 
     
      
    69 The transcript records that her Honour said that she would read the statements that had been tendered, and there was some interchange between her Honour and counsel which it is unnecessary here to detail. Her Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yes, the statement of [the complainant], ‘the accused applies for leave to adduce evidence of the complainant’s sexual activity or lack of sexual activity contained in the statement of [the complainant] dated 6 March.’ Now is that in relation though only to [the stepfather]?” 
        
       
       
      The answer to this question, from counsel for the appellant, was in the affirmative. 
       
      
    70 The transcript then records the following exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “HER HONOUR: And you want to cross examine her about that, about what she says happened between her and [the stepfather]? 
         
         
        [COUNSEL]: I do because it will be an inevitable result when I start to cross examine her about the note that that will have to come in. 
         
         
        HER HONOUR: We will get to the note in a moment. Then the statement of [the complainant’s mother] dated 21 May 2002.” 
        
       
      
    71 There was then an exchange which, it seems, was intended to clarify which portions of the proposed evidentiary material related to the complainant’s allegations against her stepfather, and which to her allegations against the appellant. Her Honour then asked the Crown Prosecutor: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well Mr Crown, what is your case about this note?” 
        
       
      
    72 The Crown Prosecutor stated that he did not intend to lead evidence about the note; her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No. A little bit confusing, but the note is possibly there are about three explanations of the note, aren’t there?” 
        
       
      
    73 Counsel for the appellant said that, although the Crown may not be intending to lead the evidence, he did intend to cross-examine. Her Honour then said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, that then puts your application on a different basis doesn’t it, because it won’t be disclosed or implied in the prosecution case, the accused is a person with whom the complainant had sexual activity when she was – referred to in the note.” 
        
       
      
    74 This was a reference to s293(6). As I have noted above, admissibility of evidence (adduced by way of cross examination) under subs(6) is dependent upon relevant disclosure, or implication, in the Crown case. Counsel appeared to accept that subs(6) did not avail him and said that he put his application on a different basis. 
     
      
    75 There was then some discussion, apparently about how the evidence proposed to be led, through cross examination, could otherwise fit within the provisions of s293. Counsel proposed (as recorded in the transcript) that the evidence might be admissible under:  
     
      
       
        
        “… sub-section A of 4A…, sub-section 2, line 3” 
        
       
       
      This appears to have been a reference to s293(4)(a)(ii), which permits the admission of evidence that would otherwise be excluded by s293(3) where it relates to events alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the offences charged (or one or more of them) were (alleged to have been ) committed. 
       
      
    76 The exchanges that followed also incorporated references both to the allegations made by the complainant against her stepfather, and the allegations made against the appellant. 
     
      
    77 In response to a question from her Honour, counsel for the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well the mother says [the note was found] when she was about 14, so that would be the subsequent year your Honour, but the note is referring to something that happened when she was 13. So although my client has already gone when she was 13 or gone within two days of when she turned 13, there is some suggestion that the note refers to my client, and that is why it goes to the credibility to cross examine her about that.” 
        
       
      
    78 There was then some further discussion, which is hardly illuminating, and counsel for the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No well she complained about my client to her mother, when her mother rang her at the [psychiatric institution]. And the mother had no inkling prior to that, that she was going to mention [the appellant] at all, when she did mention [the appellant] she also mentioned that that’s what the note was written about, that was some years later.” 
        
       
      
    79 Not surprisingly, her Honour then asked what was the relevance or probative value of that. The answer given by counsel for the appellant was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well it is the context of the complaint to the mother.” 
        
       
      
    80 Counsel then referred to what he asserted were contradictions in the statements made by the complainant. Her Honour reminded him that, for the evidence to be admitted, he had to show that it had probative value; she then mentioned the stress and embarrassment that might be occasioned to the complainant if she were to be cross examined on this material. This must have been a reference to the concluding words of subs(4). 
     
      
    81 After the luncheon adjournment the Crown Prosecutor put submissions in relation to whether the evidence could be admitted under s293(4)(a). Her Honour declined to allow the cross examination, giving brief reasons. It is necessary to make reference to those reasons. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is an application by the [counsel for the appellant] on behalf of his client to lead evidence under s293(4)(a) of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
        
       
       
        
        The application [was] brought forward in writing, but [counsel] accepted that after the Crown clarified the evidence the Crown proposed to lead, there would be no reference to a handwritten note which was found in the complainant’s pocket by her mother. 
        
       
       
        
        The application as I understand it is for cross examination to be allowed of the complainant concerning allegations she made against her stepfather. 
        
       
       
        
        In addition there was the finding of the note, and explanation given to her mother as to the meaning of that note. Despite some lack of clarity on behalf of the complainant what is clear is [the appellant] left the property at the end of February 1988. The complainant confines the behaviour between herself and [the appellant] between 1 September 1987 in the warmer months and when he left.” 
        
       
       
      [Her Honour then referred to the evidence of the complainant’s allegations against her stepfather and rejected that evidence as not being capable of being seen as having occurred at or about the time of the commission of the alleged behaviour on the part of the appellant; and held that those events could not be seen to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the offences alleged against the appellant were committed.] 
       
      
    82 Dealing then with the note and the subsequent conversations, her Honour referred to the various portions of the statements which I have extracted above, and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view the evidence is not admissible as nothing [counsel] wishes to rely upon comes within the exception found in [sub]section 4(a). But if I am not correct in that view having considered the evidence, its probative value is not, in my view, one which would outweigh any distress, humiliation or embarrassment the complainant might suffer as the result of its admission. 
        
       
       
        
        Accordingly the evidence will not be allowed.” 
        
       
      
    83 No application, and no ruling, was made under s293(6). 
     
      
    84 It will be seen from the above that, underlying the entire debate and discussion, was a common assumption that the evidence about the note, and of the evidence of the conversations that followed the finding of the note, and was said to cast light upon its content, was rendered inadmissible by reason of s293(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, unless it was made admissible by one or other of the sub-sections which provides for exceptions to that rule. 
     
      
    85 Of itself the note was probative of nothing. Indeed, it had virtually no factual content. The most that it could be said to assert was a hearsay allegation, by the complainant’s friend, that the complainant had, at the age of 13, engaged in sexual activity with a 25 year old. That could not possibly be admissible. The note was given content by the evidence of the complainant’s subsequent answers to her mother, when she said that the note was about “Doug” (the appellant) having “broken” her virginity. That would imply that that event had occurred when the complainant was 13. That would be inconsistent with a claim that she had had sexual intercourse with the appellant at the age of 12. 
     
      
    86 On appeal, counsel who appeared for the appellant (who was not the same counsel who had appeared at trial) took an entirely different approach. He expressly abandoned any reliance on s293. He sought to abandon the concession, made by clear implication at least, that the evidence was inadmissible by reason of s293(3). In written submissions he contended: 
     
      
       
        
        “20 It is submitted that counsel for [the appellant] should have argued that such evidence was not the kind of evidence (i.e. of sexual reputation) (sic) that s293 of the  
        Crimes Act  
        (sic) made inadmissible. Rather it should have been put forward as evidence of complaint, inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence at the trial. Significantly, the complainant said nothing in her evidence about driving in a car with [C], [the appellant] and another man, and [the appellant] having sex with her. The version given to her mother bore no resemblance to any of her evidence at the trial about various incidents with [the appellant]. It is submitted that the trial judge erred in not allowing the evidence on that basis. 
        
       
       
        
         … 
        
       
       
        
        22 It is submitted that had the evidence been allowed to be adduced there would have been evidence of a complaint made in terms completely inconsistent with the evidence in the trial. Such evidence would have severely undermined the credibility of the complainant. It is submitted that the rejection of the evidence by the trial judge resulted in a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    87 This position was maintained during oral argument. Accordingly, this Court heard no argument about any part of s293. It would therefore be inappropriate to make any definitive ruling on the correctness or otherwise of the decision made by the trial judge. I content myself with saying this. Arguably, evidence capable of yielding an inference that a complainant’s virginity has been “broken” (on an occasion other than the occasion or occasions the subject of the charges) is evidence that discloses or implies that the complainant has or may have taken part in sexual activity on some other occasion. If so, then, contrary to the submission extracted in paragraph [86] above (paragraph 20 of the written submission), it would be evidence made inadmissible by s293(3). Also, in the context of a prosecution case that postulates a history of sexual activity between the accused and the complainant over a period ending when the complainant was just a few weeks short of her thirteenth birthday, evidence capable of yielding an inference that, at the age of 13 (not 12) the complainant engaged in sexual activity with the appellant could be said to be evidence of events alleged to form part of “a connected set of circumstances” within the meaning of s293(4)(a)(ii), and therefore rendered admissible by that sub-paragraph, unless the conclusion were reached (as it was) that the probative value of the evidence did not outweigh any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. 
     
      
    88 Subs(6) calls for a consideration of the probative value of the evidence. Because of the different approach taken by appeal counsel, no challenge was made to the conclusion reached by her Honour in this respect. What follows, then, are tentative views formulated without the benefit of argument and subject to the limitations that are obvious in such circumstances. In my opinion the evidence had potential probative value, but probative value that could only have been detrimental to the appellant’s case. If admitted, the evidence could scarcely be thought to advance the appellant’s defence: it would do no more than add weight to the prosecution case, even to the point of establishing a further offence with which he had not been charged. 
     
      
    89 Evidence that a complainant engaged in consensual sexual activity with an accused person on an occasion or occasions other than those the subject of the charges might well cast light on questions of consent – where consent is an issue. But her it is to be remembered that the charges faced by the appellant were of sexual intercourse with an under-age female – no question of consent arose. The appellant denied that the encounter had taken place. I agree with McClellan CJ at CL that rejection of the evidence, even if it were admissible, did not result in any miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    90 Appellate counsel sought to show that the evidence disclosed “an inconsistent complaint”. In putting this submission he relied upon the juxtaposition of the finding of the note, the initial conversation between the complainant and her mother, and the subsequent conversation, by telephone, from the psychiatric institution between the complainant and her mother, together with the evidence given in the trial by the complainant. No doubt the later communication went a long way towards giving the content of the note a relevance to the appellant that it otherwise lacked. There was nothing in the note that identified the appellant as the 25 year old; but, in this Court, the argument proceeded on the basis that that was what was intended to be asserted, or what should be read into the note. It was certainly an available inference from all of the circumstances. Put shortly, what was said to emerge from the evidence was an assertion by the complainant to her mother that, when she was 13, the appellant had “broken” her virginity. Counsel then went on to refer to evidence given by the complainant in respect of count 6 (which was the subject of one of the verdicts of acquittal by direction). This count asserted sexual intercourse between the complainant and the appellant at a time when the complainant was 12 years of age. Her evidence in respect of that count included evidence that, after the intercourse, she had observed blood on the sheets. It was this that counsel seized upon. From that scanty evidence he sought to have drawn an inference that the complainant had, on that occasion, “lost her virginity” – i.e. at the age of 12, not 13. This was the alleged inconsistency on which he based his argument. His process of reasoning was, as I understand it, this:  
     
      
       
      (i) in the trial, the complainant alleged that all the sexual activity between herself and the appellant took place between 1 September 1987 and 21 January 1988, during the whole of which time she was 12 years of age; 
       
       
      (ii) the complainant gave evidence that, after one such encounter that occurred in the appellant’s bed, she observed blood on the sheets; 
       
       
      (iii) it should be inferred that the blood on the sheets was the result of vaginal bleeding by the complainant; 
       
       
      (iv) it should further be inferred that the blood on the sheets signified that, on that occasion, the complainant’s hymen had been ruptured and, therefore, that it was on this occasion that the complainant had “lost her virginity”; 
       
       
      (v) that the complainant’s later assertion to her mother that the appellant had “broken” her virginity on the occasion in the car referred to in her friend’s note (when she was 13) was inconsistent with loss of virginity at the age of 12; 
       
       
      (vi) that cross examination of the complainant on this issue would accordingly severely undermine her credibility in relation to the evidence she gave concerning the specific allegation against the appellant. 
       
      
    91 The argument is fundamentally flawed. It rests upon factual assumptions which cannot be sustained. There is, for example, no warrant for the assumption that the blood observed on the bed sheets resulted from the rupture of the complainant’s hymen (it may, for example, have been caused by menstruation, or by a vulval tear); there is no warrant for the assumption that in every case of bleeding following a first sexual encounter, the hymen is fully ruptured, with the result that no subsequent sexual event will result in bleeding. The argument presumes that in all cases “loss of virginity” is a single, discrete, once-only event, complete on penetration and rupture of the hymen. 
     
      
    92 I am satisfied that the cross examination of the kind now envisaged would not have advanced the defence case one iota. No miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the ruling. It is therefore unnecessary to embark upon the further question whether, by reason of the diametrically different basis upon which the admissibility of the evidence is now argued, the appellant needs leave under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1912 to rely upon the argument. 
     
      
    93 ROTHMAN J: I have read in draft the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I have also read in draft the reasons for judgment of Simpson J. 
     
      
    94 I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL. I agree with McClellan CJ at CL as to the reasons that Ground 2 ought to be rejected. 
     
      
    95 Ground 1 of the Appeal does not relate to the admissibility of evidence concerning allegations, not pursued, against the stepfather. It is therefore unnecessary to discuss that evidence. 
     
      
    96 The trial judge dealt with the submissions on the basis of the amended applications under s.293(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the “Act”). The appellant on appeal submitted that the material was able to be adduced on another basis. The terms of s.293 were not dealt with in detail. But s.293 assumes the evidence would otherwise be admissible. Evidence that is otherwise admissible is rendered inadmissible by s.293(3). 
     
      
    97 Whether s.293(3)(b) applies in the manner suggested by Simpson J may depend on the effect and meaning of the word “any” in the expression “any sexual activity”. Because it is unnecessary and was not the subject of submissions I will not deal further with that issue. 
     
      
    98 Otherwise, I agree with the reasons of Simpson J.

    2 BELL J: I agree with Hoeben J. 
     
      
    3 HOEBEN J: On 23 June 2006 the applicant was sentenced by Puckeridge DCJ in relation to a large number of offences of dishonesty. The applicant had pleaded guilty to the offences and they were dealt with in two groups. The first group consisted of nine offences of make a false instrument contrary to s300(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and nine offences of use a false instrument contrary to s300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty for each offence imprisonment for 10 years). His Honour was asked to take into account a further fifty matters on a Form 1. Of those matters forty eight were offences of making or using a false instrument and two were offences of obtaining financial advantage by deception. 
     
      
    4 The second group of offences consisted of two offences of obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years). His Honour was asked to take into account another five offences of obtaining financial advantage by deception on a Form 1. 
     
      
    5 In relation to the first group of offences, his Honour took into account the Form 1 matters when sentencing for two offences described as sequence numbers 5 and 6. For those matters his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 5 years and 3 months to commence on 15 June 2006 and to expire on 14 September 2011. His Honour set a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months to expire on 14 March 2010. His Honour imposed the same sentence for the remaining offences in the first group. The sentences were to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    6 In relation to the second group of offences, his Honour took into account the Form 1 matters in respect of the offence described as sequence number 76 and imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months to commence on 15 June 2006 and to expire on 14 December 2009. His Honour set a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 15 June 2006 and to expire on 14 June 2008. For the other offence in the second group his Honour imposed the same sentence. Those sentences were to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    7 The effect of the sentences passed by his Honour was a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months to commence on 15 June 2006 and to expire on 14 March 2010 with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months to expire on 14 September 2011. All sentences were to be served concurrently. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    8 The applicant was born on 27 July 1961. On 11 February1997 she began working in the Sydney office of American Express International Incorporated (Amex) as the Executive Assistant to the Senior Vice President of the Global Corporate Services Department. In 2000 the applicant was issued with a company Corporate Credit Card. Before the issue of this card the applicant had used the Senior Vice President’s Corporate Card for business expenses. When she was given her own card, she was informed of the company’s policy that the card was to be used for business purposes only and that receipts for all expenditure were to be submitted with any claim. She agreed to be bound by that policy.  
     
      
    9 Each month Amex issued a statement for the expenses incurred on her Corporate Card and she understood that, in accordance with company policy, she was required to complete a Travel Expense Voucher (TEV) in respect of business related expenditure and submit it, together with the relevant receipts, to the Vice President for approval. 
     
      
    10 The procedure was for the Vice President to then review the expenditure on the card, approve it by signing the TEV and to allocate a generic authorisation number to the document, authorising the payments made by the applicant as business expenses. The document was then faxed to a processing unit in India and filed there. This procedure was designed to ensure that no personal transactions were made by employees who used Corporate Cards. Each TEV was allocated to an accountable number at the time of creation, so as to enable it to be identified and linked to a specific Corporate Card Statement.  
     
      
    11 Between the date of issue of the card and the date of her arrest, the applicant spent large amounts on purchases of personal items such as clothing, jewellery, a mobile phone, mobile telephone calls, taxi fares, duty free shopping, sporting goods, photographic equipment, computer equipment, flowers, sporting event tickets, show tickets, restaurants including interstate locations, fuel, leather goods, clothing, luggage, pharmaceutical goods, accommodation, car hire, groceries including gourmet food and liquor, together with various other goods and services. Money was also spent on accommodation at five star hotels in Sydney, interstate and overseas. The applicant purchased airline tickets for herself and her husband and paid for travel expenses and goods and services while overseas. 
     
      
    12 The method employed by the applicant was to claim as valid business expenses on the TEV for the relevant periods, money she had spent on personal items and services. She also created fictitious payments and expenses so as to disguise other personal expenditure which she had incurred on her Corporate Card, which was not the subject of a claim on a TEV. Although this expenditure could not be identified by examining the fraudulent TEVs, it could be identified on the Corporate Card Statements. The applicant then signed the TEV, forged the signature of the Vice President, to whom she reported at the time, and affixed his personal payment authorisation number on the TEV. On some occasions she also forged his initials beside a number of entries on the document. This indicated to the Processing Unit that receipts for those items were either not available or that the Vice President had authorised those payments. This was not the case as the initials had been forged. She would then send a copy of the document to the Processing Unit in India.  
     
      
    13 By forging the signature of the Vice President and using his payment authorisation number, she was able to bypass the Sydney office thereby eliminating the prospect of the discovery of her fraudulent conduct at that location. As a result staff at the American Express Processing Unit in India did not question her TEV submissions, even where receipts were missing or never received, because to the best of their knowledge, the TEV claim had been authorised by the Amex Senior Vice President. 
     
      
    14 Amex has been unable to find any TEVs for legitimately incurred business expenses which were submitted by the applicant between the date of her being issued with the Corporate Credit card in 2000 and the date of her arrest in March 2005. An analysis of the TEVs which were submitted revealed that the applicant did not submit a TEV for every monthly statement issued in respect of the Corporate Card.  
     
      
    15 A comparison of the TEVs with the monthly bank statements showed that, in most cases, one TEV covered several bank statements. By completing one TEV for several statements, the applicant was able to obtain the following benefits: 
     
      
       
      (a) The statements in respect of which no TEV was submitted, were overlooked by the bureau in India because of the sporadic manner in which she submitted claims. 
       
       
      (b) By deliberately delaying the submission of the TEVs, she was able to better disguise the unauthorised debts incurred by her spending on personal items. 
       
       
      (c) The delayed submission of claims attracted “overdue payment” charges on the credit card. Company policy required that employees pay such charges. The applicant submitted these late claims with a request that they be dealt with urgently so that she would not attract a “late payment” fee. 
       
       
      The reality was that the applicant never paid any of the “late payment” fees. Instead she passed them off as valid business expenses on the various TEVs which she did submit. 
       
      
    16 The real purpose of the delayed submissions was that in processing the claims urgently the Amex Processing Unit in India would have neither the time nor opportunity to audit the validity of the fraudulent TEV claims, or to investigate the absence of receipts. The scheme was very successful. The applicant was able to continue the pattern of fraudulent and personal spending on her Corporate Credit card for many years, escaping detection and avoiding being called upon to answer for her conduct. 
     
      
    17 In civil proceedings against the applicant, Amex accepted that of the $498,327.34 claimed by the applicant on the fraudulent TEVs, it could not prove that $253,939.28 was not for a business purpose. For the purpose of settlement, Amex accepted as valid, TEV entries which by their description, appeared to be for business expenses but for which there were no receipts. The civil proceedings brought by Amex were settled by the applicant paying $220,000. This amount was raised by the applicant’s husband refinancing the mortgage on the family home. 
     
      
    18 The applicant’s fraudulent conduct only came to light after she used the Vice President’s Corporate Credit card on 1 December 2004 to purchase return first class airfares to Singapore for herself and her husband. It seems that the personal expenditure on her own Corporate Card had become so large that she was having difficulty making up expenses to hide her fraudulent spending patterns. 
     
      
    19 On 15 March 2005 the applicant attended Surry Hills Police Station by appointment in company with her solicitor. She was placed under arrest, cautioned and escorted to the custody room. At that time she declined to be interviewed. Two days later on 17 March 2005 she attended the Surry Hills Police Station and surrendered some of the items she had fraudulently purchased. These items included a laptop computer and attachments, ladies’ clothing, ladies’ shoes, luggage, sunglasses and jewellery.  
     
      
    20 Counsel for the applicant prepared a schedule which set out the total amount which had been included on fraudulent TEVs at $519,435. Of that amount the applicant had identified $94,979 as that which she had applied for her personal use. Included in the first figure was an amount of $174,313 which related to false TEVs, but it was not known and the applicant did not admit, whether she had received any of that amount. This differentiation between personal expenditure and business expenditure depended entirely upon the statements of the applicant. 
     
      
    21 The amount involved in the second group of offences, ie dishonestly obtain benefit by deception, was $186,786. The applicant admitted that the whole of that amount had involved unapproved personal expenditure by her. 
     
      
    22 The Court was advised that on 5 April 1995 the applicant had been convicted of two counts of larceny and seventy six counts of obtaining a benefit by deception. The total amount involved was $22,550. The offences related to the misuse by the applicant of her then employer’s Westpac handy card. On each count she received a bond and a community service order of one hundred hours. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    23 His Honour noted that he was required to take into account the amount of money involved and the period of time over which the offences were committed when assessing the extent of the criminality involved. His Honour characterised the offences as serious because they involved a clear breach of trust by the applicant, forgery and planning. 
     
      
    24 The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. His Honour accepted that the applicant had a gambling addiction which had been present in 1994-1995 when she had been convicted of the earlier offences and despite her attempts to overcome the problem, that addiction had continued. His Honour accepted that the gambling addiction did not excuse the applicant’s conduct but it did provide some explanation for it. His Honour accepted that the applicant was genuinely remorseful for her conduct and also had regard to the fact that Amex had accepted $220,000 in full settlement of its claims against the applicant. 
     
      
    25 His Honour found that the plea of guilty had considerable utilitarian value and that the applicant was entitled to a discount of twenty five percent in that regard. 
     
      
    26 His Honour found special circumstances in that the applicant was seeking professional help to deal with her gambling addiction and that the prognosis was good if she continued receiving that assistance. This was confirmed by a report of Dr Jacobs, the applicant’s treating psychiatrist, who considered that there was a strong chance that she would not re-offend if she maintained her current therapy. His Honour took those special circumstances into account when fixing the non-parole period but also noted that the non-parole period had to reflect the seriousness of the offences. 
     
      
    27 His Honour gave no reason why the sentences should be served concurrently, nor did his Honour offer any reason why he passed the same sentence in relation to all of the offences in the first group.  
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      Ground 1: His Honour erred in failing to properly consider the objective and subjective (and aggravating and mitigating) circumstances of the offences. 
       
      
    28 It was submitted that his Honour had not referred specifically to s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 when sentencing for the first group of offences and generally had paid too much attention to the aggravating features of the applicant’s offences to the detriment of the applicant’s subjective case. It was submitted that his Honour had not given sufficient weight to the rehabilitation already undertaken by the applicant and her good prospects of further rehabilitation. There had been double counting of aggravating features when his Honour referred to forgery and the repetitious nature of the offences over a long period of time. It was submitted that when his Honour referred to s21A when sentencing for the second group of offences, his Honour was not specific as to what factors he took into account. 
     
      
    29 It is true that his Honour did not refer specifically to the aggravating and mitigating factors in s21A. Had he done so, the result would not have favoured the applicant. The applicant not only had a record of previous convictions but convictions involving breaches of trust similar to that associated with these offences (s21A(2)(d)). The applicant had abused a position of trust (s21A(2)(k)). Significantly the offences were part of a planned criminal activity (s21A(2)(n). By way of mitigation it could be said that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend (s21A(3)(g)), had good prospects of rehabilitation (s21A(3)(h)) and had shown remorse for the offences by making reparation (s21A(3)(i)). There was also the applicant’s plea of guilty (s21A(3)(k)). 
     
      
    30 Even though his Honour did not refer specifically to those subsections, his Honour did take into account and specifically refer to all of those factors. The weight which his Honour gave to those factors was a discretionary matter for him.  
     
      
    31 There was no double counting of aggravating features. This kind of forgery is not an element of the offence of making a false instrument. His Honour was entitled to take into account the lengthy period of time over which the offences were committed, together with the sheer number of offences when assessing their objective criminality. No error has been revealed in his Honour’s approach to the aggravating and mitigating features of these offences. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: His Honour erred in the application of his finding of special circumstances. 
       
      
    32 The applicant’s submissions were directed at the sentence passed in respect of the first group of offences. It was submitted that despite finding special circumstances, when his Honour fixed the non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months the only variation to the statutory ratio provided for by s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was a reduction of two months. This, it was submitted, failed to adequately have regard to the finding of special circumstances which required a significant reduction in the non-parole period.  
     
      
    33 The overriding requirement for his Honour was to pass sentences which were appropriate to the offences. Specific and general deterrence were significant considerations when sentencing for these offences. For his Honour to have fixed a non-parole period less than that which he did would not have adequately reflected the criminality involved. This is particularly so when one has regard to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and the matters set out in relation to grounds of appeal 3 and 4. In any event his Honour did give effect to his finding of special circumstances, albeit in a relatively minor way. This involved an exercise of discretion by his Honour and error in that exercise has not been demonstrated. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in the application of the totality principle. 
       
      Ground 4: His Honour erred in taking account of offences on the Form 1. 
       
      
    34 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour’s approach of “selecting a sentence appropriate to the overall criminality and imposing that sentence in respect of all or most of the charges” was contrary to what the High Court said should be done in Pearce. Such an approach to sentencing had been disapproved by Simpson J in R v Hommoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at 67-68. It was submitted that his Honour had taken a global approach to sentencing and had not considered the criminality involved in each offence. This had caused an injustice to the applicant because the criminality involved in each offence was not necessarily the same. The offences had occurred over several years involving varying amounts of money and different fraudulent conduct. 
     
      
    35 In relation to the way in which his Honour treated the Form 1 offences, the submissions on behalf of the applicant were directed primarily towards the first group of offences. It was submitted that his Honour had taken the Form 1 matters into account in relation to two rather than one offence. It was submitted that this error was made all the more obvious because his Honour had passed the same sentence in respect of the other offences in the first group even though the Form 1 matters were not to be taken into account in relation to those offences. The applicant relied upon R v Dowd [2005] NSWCCA 113 at [40]-[41]. 
     
      
    36 As the Crown properly conceded, his Honour did err in the way submitted. Guidance had been provided by Pearce as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “45 To an offender, the only relevant question may be “how long”, and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course as questions of totality. 
        
       
       
        
        46 Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision. It is, then, all the more important that proper principle be applied throughout the process.  
        
       
       
        
        47 Questions of cumulation and concurrence may well be affected by particular statutory rules. If, in fixing the appropriate sentence for each offence, proper principle is not applied, orders made for cumulation or concurrence will be made on an imperfect foundation.” 
        
       
      
    37 Even though error in his Honour’s approach has been established, it is clear when one applies Pearce that the end result would not have favoured the applicant and must have resulted in a total sentence significantly greater than that which was passed by his Honour. This is readily illustrated by reference to the schedule of offences conveniently provided to the Court by counsel for the applicant. 
     
      
    38 The earliest offences in point of time to which the applicant pleaded guilty were sequences 39 and 40, which involved making and using a false instrument, ie a TEV on 14 August 2001. The amount involved was $6,930.29. Taking into account that this was the first in the series of offences and the amount of money involved, a sentence with a non-parole period of 1 year with a balance of term of 6 months would not be unreasonable. 
     
      
       
      The next two offences in point of time were sequences 27 and 28 of making and using a false instrument, ie a TEV. The offences took place on 7 May 2002 and the amount involved was $13,253.90. Applying the same principles, but keeping in mind that this was the second set of offences, a sentence with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months with a balance of term of 9 months would not be unreasonable. 
       
       
      The next offences in point of time were sequences 31 and 32 of making and using a false instrument, ie a TEV. The offences took place on 25 September 2002 and the amount involved was $17,544.07. Applying the same principles but taking into account the amount of money and that this was the third set of offences, a sentence of 1 year and 6 months with a balance of term of 1 year would not be unreasonable. 
       
      
    39 I do not propose to set out indicative sentences for all of the remaining matters in the first group of offences. What is clear from the proposed sentences above is that the applicant’s escalating level of criminality would produce a gradual increase in the sentences to be imposed for each offence. 
     
      
    40 When the sentencing judge came to pass sentence for either the offence described as sequence 5 or the offence described as sequence 6 (offences relating to making and using a false instrument respectively, ie a TEV) the fifty matters on the Form 1 would have to be taken into account. Each offence took place on 6 April 2004 and the amount involved was $189,703.43. Each offence was number eight in point of time and occurred when the applicant had been engaging in this criminal activity for over three years. The sentence for whichever offence (either sequence 5 or sequence 6) took account of the Form 1 matters would have to be substantial. For the reasons given by his Honour and as set out in para [46 ] hereof, the sentence passed by his Honour of a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months was appropriate for that offence. 
     
      
    41 If his Honour had followed Pearce he would have passed separate sentences for each of the offences in group one with a gradual increase in sentences culminating in the sentence for the offence which had regard to the Form 1 matters. It would have then been necessary for his Honour to consider questions of cumulation, concurrence and totality as specified in Pearce. Because each sequence of offences in that first group occurred at a different time, involved different amounts of money and involved a considerable amount of planning and preparation by way of forgery and timing the movement of TEVs to India, some element of cumulation in the sentences would have been inevitable. Even a small amount of cumulation would have resulted in a total sentence greater than that which was actually passed by his Honour. 
     
      
    42 Accordingly though clear error has been identified in his Honour’s failure to follow the process mandated in Pearce, not only has the applicant not been disadvantaged by that error, she has positively benefited from it. Similarly, no detriment has been suffered by the applicant as a result of how his Honour used the Form 1 matters. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 – The sentences are manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    43 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentences passed by his Honour were manifestly excessive because the starting point of imprisonment for 7 years was too high given that the maximum penalty for the s300(1) and (2) offences was 10 years imprisonment. The Court was provided with sentencing statistics which showed that the head sentence actually passed by his Honour was more severe than about ninety percent of similar cases in which a sentence of imprisonment had been imposed. The same submission was made in relation to the s178AB offences where the maximum penalty was 5 years imprisonment and his Honour had taken as his starting point 4 years and 6 months imprisonment. 
     
      
    44 It was submitted that these offences did not merit sentences of such severity because of the applicant’s strong subjective case, her remorse and good prospects of rehabilitation and because the amounts of money although substantial were considerably less than some of the cases referred to in the statistics. It was submitted that the circumstances of these offences lacked such matters of aggravation as greed, abuse of an executive position or professional standing and misuse of money of a vulnerable individual. 
     
      
    45 As this Court has said on many occasions, sentencing statistics can be useful but their value is often limited. Each case depends upon its own facts. The statistics to which the Court was referred all involved first offenders, not the situation which arose here where the applicant had been found guilty on an earlier occasion of significant breaches of trust involving an employer. The cases referred to in the statistics did not involve wilful and persistent offending over a long period of time with an escalating level of criminality such as here.  
     
      
    46 While I agree that in relation to a number of the offences in the first group, the sentences passed by his Honour were manifestly excessive, that is not the situation in relation to the offence which took into account the fifty Form 1 matters, given the date when that offence occurred and the amount of money to which the false TEV related. When one adds to those considerations questions of personal and general deterrence, retribution and denunciation the sentence which his Honour passed in respect of that offence was not manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    47 For this Court to quash a sentence and impose a lesser one it is not sufficient for the applicant to establish error. It is necessary that this Court be satisfied that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed” – subs6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79] and [99-100]. 
     
      
    48 Although his Honour erred in failing to follow that which was mandated in Pearce, and although his Honour did err in taking into account the Form 1 matters when sentencing for the offences set out in sequences 5 and 6, these errors have not disadvantaged the applicant. For the reasons indicated had his Honour passed individual sentences for each offence, the end result would have been a greater total sentence of imprisonment for the applicant. In respect of the use of the Form 1 matters, I am not persuaded that the sentence passed by his Honour is excessive and that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed had his Honour taken those matters into account when sentencing either for the offence described as sequence 5 or for the offence described as sequence 6. Given the aggravating features which his Honour identified, together with the objective seriousness of the offence and issues of general and specific deterrence, the sentence was within the appropriate range. 
     
      
    49 The orders which I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal is granted. 
       
      (ii) The appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 12 April 2006 following his pleas of guilty to three charges. The charges were: 
     
      
       
      (i) one count of supplying a prohibited drug (heroin); 
       
      (ii) one count of possession of a prohibited firearm; 
       
      (iii) one count of carrying a firearm in a manner likely to injure a person or property. 
       
      
    2 Pursuant to s25(1) and s32(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, the first count carries a maximum custodial penalty of imprisonment for 15 years. Pursuant to s7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 the second count carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. By Part 4, Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) a standard non-parole period of three years applies to this offence. Pursuant to s93G(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 the third offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    3 Sorby DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1:  
      imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months, commencing on 22 August 2005 and expiring on 21 August 2006; 
       
       
      Count 2:  
      imprisonment for a fixed term of two years, commencing on 22 August 2005 and expiring on 21 August 2007 (that is, concurrent with, but extending beyond, the Count 1 sentence); 
       
       
      Count 3:  
      imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years, commencing on 22 August 2006 (that is, wholly cumulative upon the sentence imposed in relation to the first count, and partially cumulative upon that imposed in respect of the second count), with a balance of term of two years expiring on 21 August 2012. 
       
       
      The facts 
       
      
    4 The drug offence was committed on 15 March 2005. While driving a motor vehicle the applicant was observed by police. Because of his manner of driving police activated sirens and lights in order to have him stop the car and submit to a roadside breath test. A passenger in the vehicle, Khoi Nguyen, threw from the window a small box. By his plea of guilty the applicant accepted that the box had been in his possession. The box was later found to contain 3.77 grams of heroin. By reason of the quantity of heroin involved, and by the operation of s29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the applicant was deemed to have had the drug in his possession for the purpose of supply (and therefore, by the definition of “supply” in s3, to have been guilty of supply) unless he proved that he had it in his possession for purposes other than supply. He made no attempt to do so, and pleaded guilty to the offence of supply. Possession alone was sufficient in the context of the relevant legislation to make him guilty of supplying the drug. The applicant was arrested, charged, and granted unconditional bail. 
     
      
    5 The second and third offences were committed during the evening of 21 August 2005 and the early hours of the following day. (They were thus committed whilst he was still subject to the bail order made in respect of the drug offence.) The applicant was at his home in Yagoona with three friends. One of the them was Khoi Nguyen, the applicant’s best friend. After a conversation about a grievance the applicant had concerning a Sydney nightclub the applicant produced a shortened double-barrelled shot gun. He showed this to his friends. He revealed that the gun was loaded with two rounds of ammunition. He posed with the gun, while the other men took photographs using mobile telephones. Mr Nguyen walked to a doorway. The applicant discharged one shot. The bullet penetrated the back of Mr Nguyen’s skull, causing severe injury. With the other two men the applicant drove Mr Nguyen to hospital. The applicant was then driven to his sister’s home. The gun was later found by police, wrapped in a shirt and secreted at the rear of a garage at his Yagoona home. Police then went to the applicant’s sister’s home. The applicant was found under a doona. He was arrested, taken to Bankstown Police Station and interviewed. He admitted having had possession of the gun, and said that he had been playing with it, and that it was in locked mode, and that he believed it would not fire. He declined to disclose how he came to be in possession of the firearm, or how Mr Nguyen came to be shot. The applicant consented to certain forensic procedures, and gunshot residue swabs, photographs and a buccal swab were taken. 
     
      
    6 Later, on the same day, at his own request, he was further interviewed. The transcript of the interview reveals that he was considerably distressed, at times almost incoherent. He told police that all four men had been involved in playing with the gun. He insisted that the safety guard had been on. He said that the shooting had been accidental, but that, because he was frightened, he had hidden the gun. He acknowledged that he had previously been involved in an incident in a nightclub, when he had been hit over the head with a bottle, but denied that he had obtained the gun for the purpose of revenge in relation to that incident. He said that he had had the gun for “half a year” and that it was for protection. He said that two years previously, people had shot at his house and that “they” (presumably the police) could not do anything about it. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was again arrested and remained in custody until the sentencing hearing. He entered pleas of guilty to all charges in the Local Court on 21 December 2005. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing proceedings 
       
      
    8 Evidence about the condition of Mr Nguyen was scanty. Such evidence as there was was contained in email communications between an officer of the Director of Public Prosecutions and a police officer involved in the investigation. The police officer conveyed information he had received from a medical registrar on 20 December 2005, four months after the offence. It was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have just spoken with Dr RAYKAR, the registrar at the brain injury unit, and she has informed me of the following: NGUYEN, still suffers from a craniotomy (portion of skull missing). The bone will be replaced in January and he will suffer the complications of that surgery. At the moment he can walk short distances without assistance, but otherwise requires aid to walk. He has left upper limb weakness, with his left hand being useless. He has cognitive deficits, but the long-term seriousness of the deficits are unable to be assessed until he re-enters the community. He is suffering from depression for which he is being medicated.” 
        
       
      
    9 The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He again denied that he had possession of the gun for the purpose of revenge following the nightclub incident, and repeated that his home had previously (“a few years ago”) been the target of a drive-by shooting and that this was the reason for his possession of the gun. Also available to the sentencing judge was a pre-sentence report, and a psychiatric report. The evidence on sentencing disclosed the following subjective circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    10 The applicant was born on 28 May 1984 in Vietnam, the fourth of five siblings. He came to Australia at the age of 11. The evidence concerning the circumstances in which he came to this country is conflicting. What is clear is that he experienced considerable disruption in his early family life. It seems that his parents separated for a time, his father travelling first to Thailand and then to Australia, his mother going first to the Philippines, and then to Australia. Until he came to Australia the applicant was looked after in Vietnam by his grandmother and older sister. Eventually, the family was reunited in Sydney. According to the author of the pre-sentence report, the family was supportive and the family environment stable. When the applicant was 13 his father died in a fishing accident. 
     
      
    11 The applicant attended school to year 11. Thereafter he held a variety of short term forms of semi-skilled employment. 
     
      
    12 He has a criminal history, commencing in July 2002 in the Children’s Court, when he was found guilty of two counts of robbery in company. In respect of each, he was granted a probation order. In October of the same year he was again before the Children’s Court, again on two charges of robbery in company. This time he was subjected to a 12-month control order, with a non-parole period of eight months. An appeal against the severity of the order had a modicum of success. The control order was confirmed (with a reduction in the non-parole period to six months) but suspended on his entering a 12-month good behaviour bond. 
     
      
    13 In about 2003 the applicant began using alcohol, although not, apparently, to excess. However, he also began using drugs, beginning with cannabis and proceeding to ecstasy and heroin, and sampling cocaine on occasions. He claimed not be addicted to drugs. 
     
      
    14 The psychiatrist, Dr Sinclair, recorded that the applicant had been deeply affected by the shooting. Mr Nguyen had been a close friend. Within a week of the shooting the applicant made an attempt on his own life by trying to cut his wrists. He has made no subsequent attempts and does not contemplate suicide. He is comforted by being informed that Mr Nguyen is making a recovery, although slowly. The two are in regular contact. The applicant suffered from acute stress disorder during the first months after the shooting, followed by acute post-traumatic stress disorder. His concentration has been affected and he suffers from anxiety. His functioning is to some extent impaired. 
     
      
       
      The remarks on sentence 
       
      
    15 Sorby DCJ recounted the facts of all offences. He observed that the facts relating to the offences, particularly the s93G offence, are objectively serious, and referred to the prevalence of drug dealing and supplying and to the maximum penalty of 15 years prescribed by the legislature as an indicator of the society’s condemnation of such activity. He referred to other sentencing principles such as retribution, rehabilitation, protection of society and general deterrence. He noted the subjective circumstances. He accepted the applicant’s expressions of remorse as genuine, particularly for the serious injury inflicted upon Mr Nguyen. He appears to have accepted that the applicant had made attempts at rehabilitation and to have been drug free whilst in prison. He noted the applicant’s age (not quite 22 at sentencing). He considered that these factors amounted to special circumstances within the meaning of s44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, justifying departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence there stated. This conclusion gives rise to the principal ground of the application. 
     
      
    16 In relation to the plea of guilty, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and is entitled to the full discount under  
        Thomson  
        [ 
        R v Thomson; R v Houlton 
         [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383] for the pleas’ utilitarian value.” 
        
       
       
      He considered the provisions of s21A of the  
      Sentencing Procedure Act. 
       
      
    17 He concluded that the applicant had not been engaged in trafficking in drugs in any substantial degree, but recognised (correctly) that the amount of the drug involved called for a custodial sentence. He concluded that a 12-month fixed term was appropriate in respect of that offence. 
     
      
    18 He then turned to the two firearms offences. He considered the offence of possession to be objectively serious. He noted the standard non-parole period (three years) prescribed by s54B of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 
     
      
    19 Having referred to the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, his Honour said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the offence under the  
        Firearms Act 
         and taking  
        Way 
        ’s [ 
        R v Way  
        [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168] case into consideration and the statutory non-parole period as a benchmark only, the appropriate sentence is less than mid-range and I consider that two years is the appropriate sentence. In relation to the s93 offence, given the overall circumstances, the loaded gun and the severe injury suffered by the victim, I consider four years appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    20 Having then considered the principle of totality, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Applying the principle of totality, I consider the period of non-parole period should be five years with a further period of two years’ parole.” 
        
       
      
    21 This was intended to be a reference to the combined effect of all three sentences and the result to be achieved by the accumulation of the sentences. His Honour proceeded to impose sentences in accordance with those determinations. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of the application 
       
      
    22 Originally, two grounds of the application were pleaded. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 1 – the learned sentencing judge erred in, having found special circumstances pursuant to s44(2) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
        , failing to take into account this finding in the determination of the non-parole period. 
         
         
        Ground 2 – the sentence imposed with respect to the offence against s93G(1)(c)  
        Crimes Act 
        , is manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
     At the hearing leave was granted to plead and argue an additional ground, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 3 – the applicant was denied procedural fairness as a result of the sentencing judge’s indication during the proceedings that the sentences should be concurrent.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1: special circumstances 
       
      
    23 S44(1) and (2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).” 
        
       
      
     The effect of subs(2) is that a sentence structured in accordance with the statutory proportions will be composed of a non-parole period that is 75% of the total sentence, and balance of term that is 25% thereof. For a historical overview of the sequence of legislative provisions concerning the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence see R v Musgrove [2007] NSWCCA 21.24 Because the first two sentences imposed were of fixed terms, the first ground applies only to the third sentence and, more particularly, to the overall sentence after accumulation. Effect was given to the finding of special circumstances in the sentence imposed in respect of the s93G offence. The balance of term significantly exceeded one third of the non-parole period. The non-parole period and parole periods were each 50% of the total. 
     
      
    25 The same did not ensue in respect of the overall sentence, after accumulation, or at least not to any significant degree: as imposed the non-parole period of the accumulated sentences is 71.4% of the total. A total sentence of seven years divided in the statutory proportions would consist of a non-parole period of five years and three months, and a balance of term of one year and nine months. Alternatively put, a non-parole period of five years would be accompanied (in a sentence structured in the statutory proportions) by a balance of term of one year and four months. The principal purpose and effect (with an exception to which I will in a moment refer) of a finding of special circumstances is to give the offender the benefit of a shortened non-parole period, with a corresponding extension of the balance of term: see R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114; R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220; R v Musgrove [2007] NSWCCA 21. 
     
      
    26 The essence of the argument advanced in respect of this ground has become all too familiar in this Court. In my opinion, as I mentioned in Musgrove, the manner in which the legislation is framed has the tendency to lead sentencing judges into error, or into the appearance of error. That is because, in requiring that the non-parole period first be fixed, the statute may appear also to require that the non-parole period first be determined. If a judge takes that course, and then finds special circumstances, the almost inevitable result will be an extension of the balance of term rather than a reduction in the non-parole period. That would result, not only in error, but in injustice. The offender receives no benefit if the non-parole period is first determined, and effect is given to the finding of special circumstances by the extension of a balance of term. 
     
      
    27 The exception to which I referred arises when a finding of special circumstances is made in the context of sentencing an offender for multiple offences, to accumulated or partially accumulated terms. Such a process can distort the statutory proportions. A judge who expressly intends to maintain the statutory proportions in the overall sentence may therefore vary the proportions of individual sentences in order to restore the statutory proportions. 
     
      
    28 It is thus necessary to give consideration to what it was his Honour intended by the finding of special circumstances. There is to be found in the Remarks no reason to believe that it was his intention to vary the proportion of the third sentence in order to overcome the effect of accumulation and restore the statutory proportions. The considerations – age, attempts at rehabilitation, being drug-free in prison – that led him to make the findings are all considerations conventionally associated with an intention to benefit the offender by reduction of the non-parole period and extension of the balance of term. 
     
      
    29 I am satisfied that his Honour’s intention, in making the finding, was to do just that. However, it was argued, the manner in which the sentences were ultimately structured may have deprived the applicant of much of the benefit of the finding. The overall non-parole period was reduced by only three months. From this, it was suggested on behalf of the applicant, it ought to be concluded that the judge began by determining the non-parole period and then, in order to give effect to the finding of special circumstances, extended the balance of term: thus giving the appearance of a benefit to the applicant but, in reality, imposing a longer head sentence than would otherwise have been imposed. 
     
      
    30 I have concluded that the argument ought not be accepted. There are, I accept, some features of the Remarks that would permit a construction as contended for on behalf of the applicant – that in order to accommodate the finding of special circumstances, the judge fell into the error of extending the balance of term rather than reducing the non-parole period. 
     
      
    31 But there is another, preferable, construction of the Remarks. His Honour expressly held that the non-parole period ought to be five years. In my opinion he reached this view after taking into account the finding of special circumstances – that is, five years represents the already varied (reduced) non-parole period. The reduction allowed (three months) was not great, but also not insignificant. 
     
      
    32 This conclusion has the added attraction that it conforms with what would be an appropriate sentence. Having regard to the totality of the criminality, a non-parole period of less than five years would scarcely be adequate. 
     
      
    33 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: manifestly excessive? 
       
      
    34 This ground also applies only to the s93G offence. The argument advanced in support is also familiar. 
     
      
    35 From the judge’s reference to the “full discount” under the decision in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 it is to be inferred that he proposed to allow the applicant a reduction in sentence, referable to the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, of 25%. Factoring this into the sentence imposed, it must be concluded that the starting point for that sentence was of a total term of eight years – against a statutory maximum of ten years. It was submitted that this starting point was excessive. 
     
      
    36 In putting this submission, counsel accepted that the fact that the applicant was on bail at the time of the second and third offences was an aggravating factor, and that the severity of the injury occasioned to Mr Nguyen was also relevant to the determination of the sentence to be imposed. Other, mitigating, factors were, however, advanced. These included that the discharge of the weapon was accidental; that the applicant was, at 21, a young man, and that the circumstances of the offence reflected immaturity; the absence of any relevant record; the significant psychological distress (including the suicide attempt) occasioned to the applicant; the remorse shown by the applicant from the outset, including his action in calling an ambulance, in admitting his conduct to police, and his evident distress when interviewed. (I would note that, if the discharge of the weapon had been anything other than accidental, the overwhelming likelihood is that the applicant would have been facing significantly more serious charges. The fact that the weapon discharged made this a very serious instance of an offence against s93G.) 
     
      
    37 Counsel also referred to other decided cases concerning offences against s93G. In my opinion these are of little assistance in determining the issues raised by this ground of the application. 
     
      
    38 When seen as a proportion of the maximum sentence available, it may be recognised that the starting point was indeed high. However, when the circumstances of the offence itself are measured against offences encompassed by the section, the starting point is not, in my opinion, manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    39 Under this ground, complaint was also made about the structure of the sentences, specifically, the accumulation of the s93G offence upon the Firearms Act offence – possession of the prohibited firearm. It was pointed out that the two firearms offences were closely related, the implication being that it would have been appropriate to have ordered that those sentences be served concurrently. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion, having regard to the nature of the three offences, and the dates of their commission, it would have been more conventional to have made the two firearms offences concurrent, or partly concurrent, with one another. However, it would also have been conventional, and, in my opinion, required, that those sentences be accumulated upon the sentence imposed in respect of the drug offence. Accordingly, although the nature of the accumulation is, perhaps, a little unusual, no injustice to the applicant has been occasioned thereby. 
     
      
    41 I would reject this ground of the application. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: procedural fairness 
       
      
    42 This ground arose out of an exchange, during the course of submissions, between the sentencing judge and counsel who appeared for the Crown. Having discussed the drug offence, counsel (for the Crown) recognised that the quantity of drug involved was relatively small and accepted that, while a custodial sentence would have been appropriate, it would have been open to have suspended that sentence or ordered that it be served by way of periodic detention. However, both he and the sentencing judge also recognised that a period of full-time custody was called for in relation to the firearms offences. Counsel for the Crown then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The other option of course your Honour is if your Honour does think that it is appropriate, sentencing him together with the other offences, is giving him a short term of imprisonment for that particular offence.” 
        
       
       
      To this his Honour replied: 
       
       
        
        “And make it concurrent.” 
        
       
       
      Counsel said: 
       
       
        
        “Make it concurrent. Precisely.” 
        
       
      
    43 A little later, still in discussion with counsel for the Crown, his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s one course of conduct though isn’t it.” 
        
       
      
     This, presumably, was intended to refer to the two firearms offences and not the drug offence. Counsel for the Crown answered in the affirmative, and his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So concurrent sentences.” 
        
       
      
    44 Counsel for the applicant therefore submitted that the applicant (through his counsel) had been lulled into a false sense of security by believing that all sentences would be made concurrent; and that counsel, accordingly, did not further address on this question. 
     
      
    45 Reliance was placed upon a decision of this Court: Fairbairn v R [2006] NSWCCA 337. There, the sentencing judge (the same sentencing judge as in the present case) had also expressed an opinion that the offences were part of one course of conduct, to which the Crown assented. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t think there should be cumulative sentences imposed in this case.” 
        
       
      
     Counsel for the Crown expressly acknowledged that this was an appropriate approach.46 A similar ground of appeal was there taken. Bell J, with whom Basten JA and Hidden J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “To my mind the judge should not have departed from the indication without alerting the applicant’s legal representative to the fact that he was considering accumulating the sentences. … Here the applicant was for practical purposes denied the opportunity of having his representative address the judge on the factors that favoured concurrency. As  
        R v Hammoud 
         [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 makes clear, there is not one correct answer to the question of how sentences should be structured in a case such as this.” 
        
       
      
    47 There are, in my opinion, two answers to the complaint made on behalf of the applicant. Firstly, I do not read the exchanges as being, in the present case, as explicit as was the exchange in Fairbairn. The passages I have extracted suggest that his Honour was repeating the submissions put on behalf of the Crown, in order to be clear; although he referred to “one course of conduct”, that was in the context of a reference to “both offences”, and could not rationally have been a reference to the drug offence. As I have indicated above, it would have been open to him to have imposed concurrent sentences in relation to the two firearms offences; it would have been quite inappropriate, indeed, indicative of error, to have imposed a wholly concurrent sentence in relation to the drug offence. 
     
      
    48 I would reject this ground of the application. I do not think the applicant was denied procedural fairness having regard to the way the discussions were conducted. 
     
      
    49 Accordingly, I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT  
      (on application by Accused for pre-trial hearing on objection to evidence in light of the decision in  
      Commissioner of Taxation v Indooroopilly Children Services (Qld) Pty Limited  
      [2007] FCAFC 16 - see PT919) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 20 July 2006, I commenced to hear a series of pre-trial applications, in advance of the trial of the Accused, upon a number of counts alleging: 
     
      
       
      (a) defrauding the Commonwealth under s.29D  
      Crimes Act 1914 
        
      (Cth) 
      ;  
       
       
      (b) agreeing to receive a benefit, namely money, whilst an officer of the Commonwealth on an understanding that the exercise by him of his duty as an officer of the Commonwealth would be affected: s.73  
      Crimes Act 1914 
        
      (Cth) 
      ; and  
       
       
      (c) whilst an officer of the Commonwealth, publishing to Richard Llewellyn Morgan, a person to whom he was not authorised to publish, documents which came into his possession by virtue of him being a Commonwealth officer and which it was his duty not to disclose: s.70  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      .  
       
      
    2 I have delivered a series of judgments on pre-trial applications heard since July 2006. The trial is fixed to commence before a jury on Monday next, 5 March 2007.  
     
      
    3 Yesterday evening, 28 February 2007, an email was received from Senior Counsel for the Accused indicating a desire to raise a further pre-trial argument. Reference was made to a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Commissioner of Taxation v Indooroopilly Children Services (Qld) Pty Limited [2007] FCAFC 16, a decision given on 22 February 2007. It was foreshadowed that this decision provided a foundation for a further argument with respect to an aspect of evidence in the case.  
     
      
    4 Today, the matter being before me for mention for the purpose of any procedural issues before the commencement of the trial next Monday, Mr Sutherland SC, for the Accused, has indicated a desire to seek a pre-trial hearing.  
     
      
    5 Application was made for a temporary stay of the trial to allow representations to be made on behalf of the Accused to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in light of the decision of the Full Federal Court in Indooroopilly. I infer that this has not yet been done, despite the fact that the decision was handed down a week ago. I do not regard this as being a reason for an adjournment of the trial. It is open to the legal representatives for the Accused, as it has been since 22 February 2007, to make such representations as they see fit to the Director in that respect.  
     
      
    6 Application was made for a temporary stay of the trial to allow time to prepare an argument based upon the Indooroopilly decision which could be advanced by way of pre-trial application. I sought from Mr Sutherland SC an indication as to the arguments which he sought to advance by reference to the decision in Indooroopilly, and asked him to identify with some precision the nature of the pre-trial application which he seeks to make. In its final form, the application was said to be an application to exclude evidence concerning fringe benefit tax matters, including the evidence of what I will describe as the Lowman Chow paper and other pieces of evidence, on the ground that they are not relevant to the case. It was submitted that the Crown ought not be allowed to open the case until that issue of relevance had been determined.  
     
      
    7 The Crown submitted that an earlier judgment of mine on a pre-trial application had effectively dealt with this matter, based upon earlier Federal Court of Australia decisions, and that the recent Indooroopilly decision did not, in any material sense, alter the position.  
     
      
    8 In my judgment of 8 August 2006, R v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788, I considered a number of applications made at that time by Senior Counsel for the Accused seeking, amongst other things, a permanent stay of the first count of fraud, or an order quashing that count on the indictment. Arguments advanced over a number of days included the proposition that the s.29D count was foredoomed to fail on the issue of deprivation. At paragraph 100 and following of my judgment of 8 August 2006, I referred to a number of matters which had been raised in support of that argument.  
     
      
    9 As is clear from paragraph 102 of my judgment, Mr Clelland SC, then appearing for the Accused, relied upon the decisions of Kiefel J in Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] 51 ATR 629, the decision of Hill J in Walstern Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] 138 FCR 1, the decision of Merkel J in Spotlight Stores Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] 55 ATR 745, the decision of the Full Federal Court comprising Ryan, Sackville and Sundberg JJ in Pridecraft Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] 213 ALR 450 and the decision, at first instance, in Indooroopilly of Collier J at [2006] FCA 734.  
     
      
    10 It is fair to say that those decisions involved findings and conclusions by the various judges of the Federal Court of Australia on the issues raised in them, which were then relied upon in argument in earlier proceedings concerning this Accused.  
     
      
    11 The Court of Appeal in Wills v Petroulias (No. 2) [2003] 58 NSWLR 618 was invited to reconsider its earlier decision on the basis of the judgments in Essenbourne and Walstern. At paragraphs 108 and 109 of my judgment of 8 August 2006, I extracted passages from the judgment of Spigelman CJ (Handley and Santow JJA agreeing) with respect to those matters.  
     
      
    12 The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Petroulias [2005] 62 NSWLR 663 considered aspects of the Federal Court decisions. It was a well-known fact, advocated by the Accused by that time, that there was a series of Federal Court decisions commencing with Essenbourne which the Accused said ought lead to a stay of the s.29D count against him.  
     
      
    13 It does not appear that the Court of Criminal Appeal, in either the joint judgment of the Chief Justice and Hunt AJA or the separate judgment of Mason P, expressed the view that the result of the Federal Court decisions at that time rendered irrelevant to the trial the evidence which may bear upon this issue, including the Lowman Chow document and other pieces of evidence referred to by Mason P, and repeated at paragraph 123 of my judgment. Indeed, the question was ultimately how these issues were to be left to the jury.  
     
      
    14 To date, no pre-trial application has been made before me seeking to exclude the Lowman Chow and other evidence upon the basis that it is irrelevant to this trial. Mr Sutherland SC now submits that the effect of the Federal Court decision of Indooroopilly is such that there is a strong finding which ought lead to a conclusion that the evidence which the Crown seeks to lead on this issue is irrelevant and inadmissible and that this issue ought be determined as a pre-trial issue.  
     
      
    15 I do not agree. It is clear that the decision of the Full Federal Court in Indooroopilly rejects arguments advanced on behalf of the Commissioner of Taxation, and affirms the line of authority to which I have referred. This line of authority has already been the subject of argument at earlier points in proceedings involving the Accused before the Court of Appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, Sully J and myself.  
     
      
    16 I do not consider that the latest Federal Court decision, as a matter of law, gives rise to a clear basis for a pre-trial application, or the foundation for a pre-trial application to exclude evidence.  
     
      
    17 It seems to me that the appropriate way in which issues arising from the Indooroopilly decision (and indeed, the earlier Federal Court decisions) may be considered is in the context of the trial itself. That is what the Court of Criminal Appeal envisaged in 2005. How these issues will be determined, and whether they bear upon the admissibility of any particular piece or pieces of evidence will be matters to be considered and ruled upon in the event that the issue arises. It may be that there is argument at the end of the Crown case in the light of the evidence actually adduced. It may be, and one may confidently predict there will be, submissions as to the directions to be given to the jury on these issues.  
     
      
    18 I am satisfied, however, that this is not an appropriate matter to be determined as a pre-trial application. In my view, Indooroopilly does not raise a new and clear basis. It is a basis that would have been open to the Accused in the past, but has not been the subject of earlier application.  
     
      
    19 In my view, the appropriate course to deal with this issue is in the manner in which I have foreshadowed - in the course of the trial itself.  
     
      
    20 I refuse the application for a pre-trial hearing with respect to this question.

    2 BELL J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: The Crown has appealed pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act against three suspended sentences imposed upon the respondent by Judge Donovan QC (the Judge). 
     
      
    4 The respondent was before the District Court for three separate and distinct offences. The first was an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is relevantly imprisonment for 20 years. There is a standard non-parole period prescribed of 10 years. The second offence was receiving contrary to s188 of the Crimes Act for which there is a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. In respect of this matter the respondent asked the Judge to take into account two further offences contrary to s 188. The third offence was obtaining credit by fraud contrary to s 178C for which there is a maximum penalty prescribed of imprisonment for 12 months. 
     
      
    5 On 16 October 2006 the Judge sentenced the applicant as follows: on the supply offence a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 6 months; in respect of the offence of receiving and taking into account the Form 1 matters, a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 6 months; on the fraud offence a sentence of a fixed term of 12 months. Each of the sentences was suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act upon the respondent entering into a bond. 
     
      
       
        
        The facts 
        
       
      
    6 The facts of each offence can be briefly stated. The police were lawfully intercepting telephone calls made by, or to, the applicant. On 17 June 2004 a co-offender, Erlambang, informed the respondent that he wanted “one thousand lollies” and that he would bring “the paper”. “Lollies” was code for the drug ecstasy. The respondent then called another person, Anderson, and arranged to meet in a hotel car park at about 5 pm. About an hour after this meeting the respondent contacted Erlambang and arranged for him to attend the respondent’s premises. There were further phone calls concerned with arrangements for the supply of the drug. At about 9.30pm the respondent called Erlambang and said, “I’ve got it”. Shortly thereafter Erlambang arrived at the respondent’s premises and was given the drugs. A listening device captured the two of them later counting $14,500. Further conversations between the two indicated that the drug supplied was short by 100 tablets. The next morning the respondent spoke to his supplier and informed him that Erlambang was not happy but added, “I said we’re going to fix them up next time”. The respondent obtained a commission of $500 for his efforts. The amount of drug supplied was 250 grams. The commercial quantity for MDMA is 125 grams. 
     
      
    7 The charge of receiving related to the respondent’s attempts to dispose of some crates of vodka that had been stolen by other offenders, one being Anderson, the person who had supplied the drugs the subject of the first charge. Seven pallets of alcohol worth $90,000 had been stolen from a warehouse on 6 or 7 May 2004. During intercepted telephone calls on 18 May the respondent was heard asking the recipient of the call whether he drunk vodka and indicating that there were 235 boxes at a cost of “a hundred a box”. Later the respondent contacted Anderson and told him that he thought he had arranged the sale for “a hundred a time”. The respondent indicated that he had to lower his commission and Anderson said that he would reduce his own profit to assist. There were further conversations between the persons who had stolen the vodka and the respondent about his ability to sell it. The respondent at one stage told his de facto that he would get $900 from this venture. The planned sale did not proceed and the respondent made calls endeavouring unsuccessfully to secure a purchaser. 
     
      
    8 The two matters taken into account related to the respondent’s involvement with other stolen goods. On 5 March 2004 the respondent asked an associate whether he was interested in purchasing a scissor lift. At one stage police saw the applicant driving a stolen truck with the lift on its tray. The truck was driven to a caravan park in Mt White where the lift was unloaded from the truck to another vehicle and taken to the home of the purchaser. The lift was valued at $18,000. The second offence alleged that the respondent was an accessory after the fact to the receiving of electrical appliances stolen on 31 May 2004. Shortly after the theft the respondent spoke to an associate asking him to hire a van and to leave it at a designated location. This was done and the van was used to transport the stolen goods. Police later stopped the van and property worth over $66,000 was recovered. After the arrest of the driver the respondent rang his associate and advised him of a false story to tell the police. 
     
      
    9 The fraud matter concerned a false document used by the respondent to obtain a loan to purchase a motor vehicle. On 6 March 2004 he telephoned an associate and asked to be supplied with a letter “like last time please”. The respondent later came into possession of a document indicating that he had been employed with a specified company since 1999 and was in receipt of a salary of $725 per week. In fact the respondent was unemployed and in receipt of a disability pension. As a result of the use of this document the respondent obtained credit to the value of $24,815.39 that otherwise would not have been made available to him. 
     
      
       
        
        The subjective case 
        
       
      
    10 The respondent was born on 8 June 1951. He had an extensive criminal record from 1965 to 1981 for offences of dishonesty. He had during that time been sentenced to periods of imprisonment. He was last sentenced to prison in 1985 for the possession of an unlicensed pistol. In 2001 he was fined for hindering the investigation of a serious indictable offence, goods in custody and possessing a radio transmitter. 
     
      
    11 A pre-sentence report revealed that the respondent had explained his earlier criminal lifestyle by the fact that he was rebellious and associated with a poor peer group after 1967 when his stepfather, to whom he was very close, died. He said that his attitude changed after he met his de facto, Ms McLoughlin. They have three children aged 22, 15 and 9 years. The respondent suffered a motor vehicle accident in 1990 that rendered him unfit for work. He and his de facto each received a disability benefit and the family also received an allowance. They lived in a rented house provided by the Department of Housing. 
     
      
    12 In explanation for the offences the respondent told the officer preparing the report that he had been “set up to get me in trouble” and that he had been pressured into offending. He stated that there was a “conspiracy” against him. He said that he did not know that the scissor lift had been stolen. He also explained that he had been led into selling items and would not have done so had he been able to rely upon the judgment of his wife. The officer opined that the respondent was “someone who is easily influenced or manipulated without being able to give due thought to the severity of the consequences”. Because of his attitude to the offences he was assessed as unlikely to require or benefit from supervision. 
     
      
    13 There was a report in evidence from a psychologist. She stated that when she interviewed the respondent he presented as “dazed, confused, and highly agitated and stressed”. She stated that he appeared to be of “dull intelligence”. The respondent said that he could not have found her rooms had it not been for his wife. He told her that since his accident, his memory had been affected, he could not make decisions and he “relies upon others to tell him what to do”. The psychologist concluded: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[The respondent’s] presentation at our interview and objective cognitive assessment indicate that he has significant and measurable cognitive deficits, over a range of tasks involving verbal learning and memory, perceptual organisation, and motor speed and attention. His level of intelligence also shows a relative inferiority in verbal areas of ability compared to nonverbal problem solving. His verb intelligence lies in the lowest 2 percentile of population norms whereas his nonverbal intelligence sits around the low average range………..” 
        
       
      
    14 The respondent had medical problems. He suffered poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hypertension and ischaemic heart disease. He had a laminectomy in 2000, a left shoulder reconstruction in 1990, suffers from Crohn’s disease of the intestine, and was taking anti-depressants to relieve his depression and chronic anxiety. He had chronic pain arising from his back injury suffered in the motor vehicle accident. 
     
      
    15 There was evidence of the respondent’s assistance to the Crime Commission and the Police integrity Commission in relation to an investigation of a former police officer. He had signed an undertaking to give evidence against the officer, although no prosecution had been commenced at the time of sentencing. 
     
      
    16 The applicant’s de facto wife gave evidence before the Judge. She herself was charged with supplying a commercial quantity of MDMA arising from the respondent’s supply of the 1,000 tablets on the basis that she had aided and abetted him in that crime. She was also sentenced to a term of imprisonment that was suspended. She gave evidence as to the effects upon her and her family of the assistance the applicant had given to authorities and the fears that she held for their safety as a result. She indicated that her husband expected to receive a custodial sentence and that he believed he would not survive it. 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown submissions 
        
       
      
    17 The Crown submitted “in the circumstances of this case the suspended sentences were not appropriate or available”. The Crown argued that the Judge erred in deciding in each case to impose a suspended sentence before determining on the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the offence. In that regard the Crown relied upon decisions of this Court as to the manner in which a court should approach sentencing under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act such as R v BCC [2006] NSWCCA 130 in the judgment of Hall J at [51] and following. 
     
      
    18 Next the Crown submitted that the Judge failed properly to apply the principles in Pearce in relation to sentencing for multiple offences in that the Judge gave no consideration to the question of totality before determining to suspend the sentences. The Crown argued that, had he considered the totality of the criminality before him, the Judge would have determined that an overall sentence of more than two years was called for and, therefore, could not have suspended any of the individual sentences. 
     
      
    19 The Crown also submitted that the Judge had erred in giving a discount for the plea and assistance that was “overly generous”. The Judge said in relation to the supply offence 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…….It seems to me that the level of discount which this matter warrants is 25 per cent for the plea and I think it is not unreasonable to consider that the assistance warrants a further discount of 60 to 70 per cent………..” 
        
       
       
      In sentencing for the receiving offence the Judge referred to the “factors I have set out in the supply matter” and, when sentencing for the fraud offence, referred to “the reasons I have set out above” when determining not to impose a period of full-time custody for either offence. It is clear that the Judge must have taken into account a discount of the same proportion when sentencing for each of the offences. 
       
      
    20 The Crown focussed its attack principally upon the sentence for the supply offence submitting that, in light of the standard non-parole period of 10 years, the sentence imposed, as to its term, was manifestly inadequate to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence before any consideration was given to the fact that the sentence was suspended. 
     
      
       
        
        The respondent’s submissions 
        
       
      
    21 Mr Dhanji for the respondent accepted that the sentences were lenient but submitted that they were within the sentencing judge’s discretion. He reminded the Court of the principles governing Crown appeals and set out in his written submissions the often-quoted passage from R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 where Wood CJ at CL summarised those principles. 
     
      
    22 It was submitted that each of the sentences was appropriate. In respect of the supply offence Mr Dhanji relied on the principle of parity. He noted that the co-offender Erlambang was sentenced by the Judge to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. He argued that, after a discount for a plea, the starting point for that sentence must have been 5 years. It was submitted that in the respondent’s case a discount of 60 per cent for the plea and assistance should be applied to that starting point so that 2 years was an appropriate sentence to be imposed upon him. It was pointed out that the respondent’s de facto received the same sentence as the respondent even though she could not rely upon his assistance to the authorities. No Crown appeal has been lodged against either of those sentences. 
     
      
    23 It was argued that, even putting aside the issue of parity, the sentence for the drug offence was not inadequate and that the Judge had not erred in his approach to determining that sentence. It was submitted that, in light of the respondent’s strong subjective case, the sentence of 2 years was within range and the decision to suspend the sentence could not be said to be “unreasonable or plainly unjust”: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 324. 
     
      
    24 It was submitted that there was no breach of the Pearce principle in the approach taken by the Judge. It was argued that it was appropriate for the Judge to consider each sentence individually and determine what the appropriate sentence for each should be and how it should be served. It was submitted that the only relevance of the further offences before the Judge was that they were part of his criminal antecedents: see R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381. 
     
      
    25 In respect of the discretion of the Court not to interfere even if it considers the sentences to be manifestly inadequate, the respondent relies upon an affidavit in which he expresses his fear of reprisals and his belief that he will not be safe while in custody by reason of the assistance he has given. The respondent also complains of the increase in his anxiety caused by the Crown appeal. 
     
      
       
        
        Did the judge err? 
        
       
      
    26 The Judge took, what must be said to be, an unusual course in sentencing the respondent. He approached the matter by dealing with each of the offences separately, as if each represented a completely independent sentencing exercise. For example, his Honour commenced with the supply offence and considered the facts of that offence, the subjective features of the respondent, and then imposed the sentence for that offence before moving on to consider the receiving offence. At one point in his sentencing remarks for the supply offence the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I am aware that he has other offences charged before me and I will come to them later. Nevertheless, I have to deal with this matter at the present and consider what is the appropriate penalty.” 
        
       
      
    27 In my opinion this was an erroneous way of carrying out the task of sentencing the respondent. I do not believe that, in a case where the one offender is being sentenced for a number of offences, it can ever be appropriate to determine the sentence for each offence as if it were the only matter before the court. True it is that the court must decide the appropriate sentence for each offence independently and that the sentence for one offence cannot be increased simply because there happens to be other offences committed by the offender for which he or she is to be sentenced. But it does not follow that it is irrelevant to the determination of the sentence for one offence that the offender is before the court for sentence on other offences. 
     
      
    28 The principle of proportionality prevents a court from increasing a sentence by reason of past offending: McNaughton v R [2006] NSWCCA 242. It also prevents a court from increasing the sentence for one offence simply because the offender has committed other offences for which sentence is to be passed, whether the other offences were committed before or after the offence under consideration. But it is uncontroversial that the fact that an offender has committed offences in the past is relevant to a determination of the sentence to be imposed for the offence before the court: see s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and McNaughton. So too it may be relevant that an offender has committed offences for which he or she has been sentenced at a time after the offence for which sentence is being imposed: R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381. Therefore, it would be illogical that the court could not take into account other offences for which the offender is before the court for sentence. 
     
      
    29 But it is obviously relevant that the offender is before the court for sentence for more than one offence when the penalty for any individual offence is being determined. Clearly it may be a fact or circumstances relevant to the commission of a particular offence that, at or about the time when that offence was committed, the offender committed other offences. It would be relevant, for example, to a finding whether the particular offence was an isolated “fall from grace” or whether it was merely an instance of a course of criminal conduct in which the offender was involved at the relevant time. 
     
      
    30 So in sentencing the respondent for any one offence it was highly relevant that all of the offences and the matters on the Form 1 were committed in a period of about four months and that each offence represented a different aspect of the respondent’s overall criminality in that period. Not only was he engaged in a drug trafficking organisation, but he was also acting as a receiver for certain thieves and further he was also acting dishonestly on his own behalf. The fraud offence was clearly relevant to his claim in respect of all of the offences that he was easily led and imposed upon by others because of his low intellect. 
     
      
    31 The fact that an offender is to be sentenced for more than one offence must also have implications for the sentence for any one offence simply because there are statutory and other limitations upon sentencing orders that can be made. For example, there is a limit upon the amount of periodic detention that can be served by way of accumulation of sentences; see s 67 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The court must before imposing sentence for any one offence have some understanding of what the final sentence will be for all offences simply so that individual sentences can be imposed within available sentencing options. For example, a suspended sentence cannot be imposed where an offender is serving a sentence of imprisonment that has not been suspended: see s 12(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Some limitations will be imposed upon available options simply by reason of the utility of making orders which are on their face contradictory, for example by imposing a sentence of periodic detention on one offence and a sentence of full-time imprisonment on another. 
     
      
    32 It is obvious that, before a court commences to pass sentence for a particular offence, it must have determined the ultimate sentencing outcome for that offence. Neither statute nor case law requires a judge to determine, or pass, a sentence in discrete stages without a decision having been reached as to the final sentencing order. For example R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17, which requires a judge to consider the appropriate sentence before determining how the sentence is to be served, obviously does not require a judge to commence the sentencing remarks without knowing what the final outcome of the sentence will be. It simply requires that, when a court is determining the sentence to be imposed for any offence, it must follow a process of reasoning that is structured consistently with the objects and provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Similarly s 44 of that Act does not require a court to determine the length of the non-parole period without having decided what the balance of the term will be: R v Perez [2004] NSWCCA 218. 
     
      
    33 So when a court is sentencing for multiple offences and before it imposes the sentence for any one offence, it will have considered the outcome for all offences. It will have done so for at least two reasons: firstly, in order to ensure that the court imposes sentences that fall within statutory limitations, that are consistent with sentencing principles and that do not conflict with one another. Secondly it will ensure that the overall sentence imposed reflects the overall criminality of the offences before the court. 
     
      
    34 It is unnecessary in the present case to consider the applicability of the principle set out in Pearce to a situation where a court is imposing suspended sentences. There are obvious cases where the principle cannot literally apply, for example in relation to the imposition of fines because they cannot be accumulated. Nor can suspended sentences be accumulated, at least when they are pronounced, although it might be different if the bonds were revoked: see s 99(c)(ii) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that applies the whole of Part 4 of the Act as if the sentence was being then imposed. 
     
      
    35 Therefore, I have reached the conclusion that the sentencing discretion miscarried by reason of the approach adopted by the Judge in considering the appropriate sentence for each offence in isolation. There can be no argument that at least the supply and the receiving offences each warranted the imposition of a custodial sentence notwithstanding the respondent’s subjective case. The respondent was not so discomforted by his physical condition or so inhibited by his mental disabilities that he could not be an active participant in a number of criminal offences of significant seriousness. Claims that he made to the psychologist and the probation officer about the extent of his physical and intellectual disabilities are simply not borne out by the objective facts of the offences. With respect, the Judge’s finding that the respondent fell within s 21A(3)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in that he was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions, was not open given the offences committed by him and the recorded conversations of his participation in those crimes. 
     
      
    36 Despite his claim of reform since he had met his wife, the simple fact is that the respondent was participating in the business of a receiver and a drug supplier at the time he was being investigated by police. It is clear from the facts that neither the supply offence nor the fraud offence was an isolated aberration. This is not to suggest that the respondent was to be sentenced other than for the offences to which he had pleaded guilty, but the particular offences have to be seen in the context of each other and of what inferences can be drawn from what the respondent said and did. By considering each offence separately and sentencing as if each stood in isolation one from the other, the Judge failed to consider the offences as a course of criminal conduct in which the respondent was involved for a not insignificant period of time.  
     
      
    37 I have no doubt of the correctness of the Crown’s submission that in each case the Judge erred by deciding to impose a suspended sentence before determining what sentence was appropriate for the particular offence. The sentencing remarks for each offence suggest that is so. In each case the Judge merely recited the facts of each offence verbatim from the statement of facts tendered and there was little, or no, attempt to analyse the criminality of the respondent for any of the offences either considered individually or in combination. Yet the Judge could not determine the appropriate sentence without undertaking such a task. However, in my view, it is obvious from the sentence imposed for the fraud offence that the Judge could not have decided the appropriate sentence for that offence before deciding to suspend the sentence: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [26]. The Judge imposed the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence under s 178C yet he could not have concluded that the conduct fell within the worst category of offending even before taking into account the subjective features of the respondent and the appropriate discounts for the plea and assistance. 
     
      
    38 Further the Judge determined that the same sentence was appropriate for the receiving offence as for the supply offence. This was notwithstanding the substantial difference in the maximum penalties for the two offences, the existence of a standard non-parole period for the supply offence, and the very great seriousness with which courts regard offences of supplying drugs. Without any explanation as to how the Judge derived each of the sentences appearing in the sentencing remarks, I can only conclude that he chose to impose in each case the longest sentence that would permit him to suspend the sentence and that was consistent with the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence. 
     
      
    39 It is clear also from what the Judge said about the discount for assistance that he could not have been approaching his task in the appropriate way. The Judge stated that a discount of “60 to 70 per cent” could be granted for assistance without actually deciding what the discount would be. The only explanation is that it did not matter what the precise discount was because the sentences had been predetermined by the decision to suspend them. 
     
      
    40 So far as the specific sentence for the supply offence was concerned it was inadequate even without the order suspending the sentence. As has already been noted, from what was said in the recorded conversations proving the offence it is clear that this was not an isolated incident and the only available inference is that the respondent was in the business of supplying drugs for profit as the middleman between the supplier and the purchaser. I would reject the submission made on his behalf that his criminality was at the “low end of the scale”. In any event there is ample authority that persons at any position in the hierarchy of the supply of drugs should receive significant sentences in recognition of their criminality in performing any role in such a serious criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    41 A non-parole period of 18 months as against a standard non-parole period of 10 years was on its face manifestly inadequate. The Judge did not attempt to apply the authorities of this Court as to how to approach the task of sentencing after a plea of guilty in respect of a standard non-parole period case. This Court has stated on numerous occasions that a judge is not to ignore the standard non-parole provisions just because the offender pleaded guilty, but is to give reasons in accordance with s 54B(3) for departing from the standard non-parole period. This is not to suggest that the standard non-parole period or anything like it was appropriate in the respondent’s case, but there was no attempt to assess the respondent’s criminality with that benchmark in mind. 
     
      
    42 The only reference made to any aspect of the objective circumstances of the supply offence that would have been relevant in determining where in the range of offending the respondent’s conduct lay was a passing reference to the amount of drug involved. The Judge said that one of the factors he could consider in determining not to impose a full-time custodial sentence was the amount of the drug, remarking that it was not at, or close to, the maximum commercial quantity. With respect, if the amount of the drug had been at the level, it would be a case of imposing a sentence of, or above, the standard non-parole period of 10 years. The simple fact is that the amount of drug supplied by the respondent was twice the commercial quantity, which should have indicated that a suspended sentence was inappropriate rather than the converse. 
     
      
    43 With respect, the Judge seems to have accepted assessments of the respondent’s personality without having any regard to the facts of the offences before him. For example, it is impossible to conclude that the respondent was easily led into the commission of the offences. How was this finding consistent with him having arranged to obtain the drug from Anderson and the conversations that followed the finding that the amount supplied was short? How was it consistent with the respondent organising the truck for the receiving of the stolen electrical goods? Where in the fraud offence is there the slightest suggestion that others led the respondent into committing the crime that he initiated for his own benefit? Although this Court generally should give paramountcy to decisions of facts made by sentencing judges, it should not accept them where they are not borne out by the objective facts of the offences committed. As has already been noted, whatever might have been the intellectual and physical disabilities of the respondent, they did not impede him conducting himself as a drug supplier, as a receiver of stolen goods or as a fraudster. 
     
      
    44 I have already commented on the fact that it is impossible to know what discount the respondent received for his plea of guilty and the assistance given because the Judge did not determine what it was. It was apparently somewhere between 85 per cent and 95 per cent, depending upon what discount was given for assistance in addition to the 25 per cent for the pleas. It is obvious that such a combined discount must result in a sentence that is in breach of s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, because it must result in a sentence that is “unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence”. In any event this Court has recently confirmed that a combined discount for the plea and assistance in excess of 50 per cent will be unusual: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19. In this case a combined discount in excess of 55 per cent is unjustified. 
     
      
    45 There is nothing in the subjective circumstances of the respondent, including his assistance to the authorities, that could justify anything but a full-time custodial sentence, and that includes his fears and any risk of reprisals as a result of the assistance he has given or that he is prepared to give in the future. It must be understood that the discount for assistance acknowledges that the offender may be put at risk by the assistance given. In the present case there appears to have been no consideration by the Judge as to why the safety of the respondent required other than a full-time custodial sentence in order to provide him with adequate protection. There was no evidence that the respondent’s life would be any more endangered in prison than outside of it or that reasonable safeguards for the respondent were not, or could not be, put in place within the correctional institutions: cf York v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1919. 
     
      
    46 There is nothing in the affidavit of the respondent or otherwise that in my view justifies this Court in exercising its discretion to refrain from intervening so inadequate were the sentences imposed upon the respondent. 
     
      
    47 The sentencing discretion having miscarried this Court must re-sentence the respondent afresh. In determining the orders I propose I have taken into account that the respondent has been subject to the sentences for a period of about 4 months and the double jeopardy involved in the fact that the respondent now faces full-time custody after being given the benefit of suspended sentences. For that reason I propose that the sentences be backdated by 2 months. There are in my view no special circumstances as the respondent cannot be assisted by the parole service and there is no other reason to reduce the non-parole period except by reason of the accumulation of sentences. 
     
      
    48 I have indicated my view that the sentence for the supply offence was manifestly inadequate even disregarding the order suspending the sentence. I have also noted that the co-offender was given a sentence that was also at least arguably inadequate having regard to the standard non-parole period. The issue of parity arises and is relied upon by the respondent. As this is a Crown appeal and because the co-offender’s sentence was not the subject of a Crown appeal, it seems to me as a matter of discretion that the Court is constrained not to increase the sentence if the order of suspension is quashed. Although this Court is not bound by an inadequate sentence imposed upon a co-offender, I believe that the Court should moderate its response in the present case, in light of the fact that the respondent initially received a sentence that allowed him at liberty in the community. 
     
      
    49 I have departed from the standard non-parole period for the supply offence by reason of the plea of guilty, the role of the respondent in the offence, the assistance given to the authorities in the past and in the future, and to achieve parity with the co-offender. Because this is a Crown appeal the length of the sentences are limited by considerations of double jeopardy. It should be taken however that the respondent has received the benefit of discount for his plea and assistance of about 55 per cent and 15 per cent of that is for future assistance. I have proposed a fixed term for the receiving offence because of the lack of utility in specifying a non-parole period in light of the sentence for the supply offence. The fixed term is the equivalent of the non-parole period and has been reduced by reasons of totality: see Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616. 
     
      
    50 I propose that the following orders be made: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The sentences imposed by Judge Donovan are quashed;

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) from an order by the trial judge dismissing his motion which sought the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. A stay of the proceedings until further order of the court. 
       
      In the alternative: 
       
      2. That the Crown Prosecutor be restrained from further representing the Crown in these proceedings. 
       
      
    2 The applicant has also filed a motion returnable in the Court of Appeal seeking the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. A declaration that the District Court ought have exercised the powers sought in the notice of motion filed in the District Court of New South Wales and dated 21 February 2007. 
       
       
      2. An order staying the District Court of New South Wales in the matter of Regina v MG until a new Crown Prosecutor is briefed. 
       
       
      3. An order prohibiting the District Court of New South Wales from proceeding in the matter Regina v MG until the orders sought in the notice of motion (set out in paragraph 1) are made. 
       
       
      4. An order requiring the District Court of New South Wales to perform its duty and exercise the powers and make the orders sought in the notice of motion (set out in paragraph 1). 
       
       
      5. Such other orders as this honourable court sees fit. 
       
      
    3 The Chief Justice has appointed Bell and Hoeben JJ additional Judges of Appeal so that this bench may dispose of both matters. 
     
      
    4 The applicant’s essential complaint is that a prosecutor other than Ms Margaret Cunneen should be appointed to prosecute his trial. 
     
      
       
      A brief chronology 
       
      
    5 On 30 August 2000 the complainant was subjected to a series of brutal sexual assaults over a lengthy period. The applicant was tried for his alleged participation in the assaults together with three others MC, BS, and MS. A further accused person TS was separately tried and convicted. 
     
      
    6 TS appealed his conviction and by majority, Mason P and Wood CJ at CL, the conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered (Regina v TS [2004] NSWCCA 38). 
     
      
    7 During the course of that appeal the Court examined the very considerable media publicity which had surrounded the trial of the applicant and his co-accused. The Court was made aware that the Crown Prosecutor, Ms Margaret Cunneen, who prosecuted TS’s trial and who was appointed to prosecute the applicant at his first trial and has again been appointed to prosecute his retrial, spoke to the press, including radio and television journalists, immediately following the verdict in the trial of the applicant and his co-accused. She said to them: 
     
      
       
        
        “I commend the quality of the police investigation and the fortitude of the victim.” 
        
       
      
    8 These remarks were broadcast on both radio and television. This Court was critical of the prosecutor speaking to the media about the trial. In his reasons for judgment Sully J said at [113]-[114]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I pause to note that the media transcripts indicate that the Crown Prosecutor in the first trial was heard both on radio and on television to say:  
        ""I commend the quality of the police investigation and the fortitude of the victim"" 
        . It is not entirely clear from the television transcripts whether the Crown Prosecutor actually spoke to camera, but it seems to be a fair inference that such was the case.  
        
       
       
        
        For my own part, I would wish to say plainly that in my opinion a Crown Prosecutor ought never to make to the media any public comment about a trial which he or she has prosecuted; and that I understand that principle to have been, hitherto, well established. The reason for the principle lies in the unique role of the Crown Prosecutor in ensuring that the machinery of criminal justice functions with a proper objectivity and impartiality.” 
        
       
      
    9 The other members of the Court expressly approved the remarks of Sully J saying at [3]: 
     
      
       
        
        “We also agree with Sully J's remarks about the inappropriateness of Crown Prosecutors making comments to the media about trials they are prosecuting or have prosecuted.” 
        
       
      
    10 The present applicant and his other co-accused also appealed their convictions to this Court. On 7 April 2004 the applicant’s appeal was upheld, his conviction was quashed and a new trial was ordered (see Regina v [MC], Regina v [MS], Regina v [MG], Regina v [BS] [2004] NSWCCA 36). The appeals of MS and BS and MC were dismissed. The applicant succeeded in an argument in this Court that evidence of a phone call he had with MC, shortly after the latter had been interviewed by police in relation to the alleged assaults, should not have been admitted at his trial. The trial judge had admitted the evidence of the telephone call but ruled that it was not admitted as evidence of consciousness of guilt, but was available to show “close association” or “deep interest in what MC is talking about or had talked about” or “an association between two people having an interest in the matter which is the subject of the trial.” The difficulties created by the admission of the evidence were compounded by the address of the Crown Prosecutor, Ms Cunneen, when she told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “And the arrangement of course is [MC] doesn’t have to tell [MG] what happened, [MG] knows, and obviously the conversation once he arrives is to get the heads together to make sure what is said is the same thing.” 
        
       
      
    11 The Court of Criminal Appeal accepted that this sentence misrepresented the text of the intercepted conversation. No direction correcting that problem was made by the trial judge. In fact, the Court held that the directions which the trial judge gave exacerbated the situation created by the admission of the evidence against the applicant. 
     
      
    12 Preliminary hearings in relation to the new trial of the applicant commenced in the District Court on 23 August 2004. Following a pre-trial voir dire hearing the trial judge rejected the tender of a photograph of the applicant taken by the police when they were searching his residence. The Crown challenged the trial judge’s ruling and an appeal was heard by this Court on 9 February 2005 when the decision was reserved. On 25 August 2005 the court gave judgment reversing the decision of the trial judge. 
     
      
    13 On 10 March 2005 Ms Cunneen gave the Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture for 2005 to the Newcastle University Law School. We shall relate relevant parts of her address later. The address was reported in the Daily Telegraph and The Australian newspapers of 11 March 2005. Significant portions of the address were repeated with Ms Cunneen stated to be the author in the Weekend Australian published on 12 March 2005. Given the significance of the occasion of the Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture and the controversy associated with the trials about which Ms Cunneen chose to speak, it was inconceivable that her comments would not attract widespread publicity. This occurred. 
     
      
    14 The applicant’s solicitor complained about Ms Cunneen’s address to the Director of Public Prosecutions, The New South Wales Bar Association and the Legal Services Commissioner. The response from the Director of Public Prosecutions, which was dated 18 May 2005, was to note the expressed concerns. The Director indicated that he was “satisfied that Ms Cunneen remains in a position to prosecute this matter and other matters fairly and professionally and I do not propose to alter her briefing arrangements in the [MG] matter.” The Director reminded the applicant’s solicitor of the opportunity for the applicant to make applications to the court. 
     
      
    15 The Legal Services Commissioner determined the complaint and provided that determination to the applicant’s solicitor on 19 June 2006. We shall deal with the detail of the determination later. A copy of the Commissioner’s determination was tendered to the trial judge at which time the confidentiality which would otherwise attach to it pursuant to s 171 of the Legal Profession Act (1987) was waived by Ms Cunneen. 
     
      
    16 Apart from the matters to which we have referred, the trial and appeals of the applicant and his co-accused, including matters of sentence, have attracted considerable publicity. As recently as January and February this year significant publicity was given to the production of a film with the title “Wrong Girl” reported under colourful headlines including “Gang rape film outrage” and “Horror rating for gang rape film’s message.” 
     
      
       
      The Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture 
       
      
    17 A copy of Ms Cunneen’s lecture was in evidence. She commenced by reminding the audience of the great contribution which Sir Ninian Stephen has made to the law. This is followed by a short autobiographical account followed by encouragement to young lawyers to meet the challenges which the law will bring them. 
     
      
    18 Ms Cunneen told the audience that she had been a Crown Prosecutor since 1990 usually prosecuting crimes where there is a complainant, or complainants, who also have families. She remarked on the injury and trauma which crime can occasion to complainants saying that: 
     
      
       
        
        “For some victims the anguish continues in a justice system which can give the impression that it is increasingly focussed on the rights of the accused person to the complete exclusion of the right of the victims, many of whom, on any view of the evidence, have been victims of someone’s crime and have found themselves bound up in the criminal justice system through absolutely no fault of their own.” 
        
       
      
    19 Ms Cunneen acknowledged that a Crown Prosecutor is not the representative of the complainant and referred both to the Director of Public Prosecution Guidelines and the New South Wales Bar Rules, both of which provide that the prosecutor is to assist the court in arriving at the truth by a full and firm presentation of the case; the objective being to do justice between the community and the accused. 
     
      
    20 Ms Cunneen also referred to the New South Wales Charter of Victims Rights – appended to the DPP Guidelines and extracts as the first and foremost of these rights: 
     
      
       
        
        “A victim should be treated with courtesy, compassion and respect for the victim’s rights and dignity.” 
        
       
      
    21 She then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “While New South Wales, which started off as a gaolhouse, has now reached the civilised position of achieving a myriad of protections for the rights of the accused person, the course of some cases through the criminal justice system may leave you to ponder when the undoubtedly innocent (as opposed to the merely presumed innocent), the victims, will have their liberty restored.” 
        
       
      
    22 These words preface a detailed account of the trial of the men accused, including the applicant, some of whom have been convicted, of the sexual assault of Ms C. Understandably, any account of the facts of the assault would evoke great sympathy for Ms C in the terrible ordeal which she suffered. 
     
      
    23 After introductory remarks which acknowledged the increasing sophistication and complexity of the investigation of crime and the consequential increase in the complexity and length of trials, Ms Cunneen proceeded to canvass, in some detail, the facts of the alleged assaults. She included a discussion of the trial of the applicant and the miscarriage of justice which arose from the tender and admission of evidence of the phone call with MC. She said of this evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The admission, and use made, of one piece of evidence was to have a disastrous effect for the unfortunate complainant, whom, on any view of the evidence, had been subjected to an unspeakable ordeal. 
        
       
       
        
        The police arrest MC and interviewed him about several of the Bankstown rapes, A telephone intercept warrant had been obtained and his mobile phone was being monitored. During the interview, MC was given a break and left the police station to obtain some lunch. He telephoned MG and his calls were intercepted and recorded. He is heard to say: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘G…, they’ve f…ed me brother. They know your name, I’ve seen B’s name, everyone’s name. They know everything bro.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          MG replies: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘So what’s gunna happen?’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          MC says: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘I’m at the cop shop.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        They then made arrangements to meet urgently at the library nearby. 
        
       
       
        
        The trial judge ruled that this evidence was admissible to show consciousness of guilt on the part of MC but that it could not be used for this purpose against MG. Nevertheless the evidence was available to show ‘close association’ or ‘deep interest in what MC was talking about’ or ‘an association between two people having an interest in the matter which is the subject of the trial.’ 
        
       
       
        
        All four accused were found guilty by the jury. All four appealed on numerous grounds each. Of the 7 grounds in MG’s appeal he was successful in establishing that the trial judge had erred in allowing telephone intercept evidence against him and erred in his directions about that evidence. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that MG had not, in the phone call, adopted MC’s inculpatory statements or otherwise implicated himself and further, that the judge should have directed the jury, with emphasis, that this was the case and warned them against using the call as indicating MG’s consciousness of guilt.” 
        
       
      
    24 Ms Cunneen’s discussion of the proceedings with respect to the applicant does not conclude with the phone call. She continued with an account of the process of retrial and included a discussion of the Crown appeal to this Court in relation to the identification evidence. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A psychiatrist was called by the defence to challenge the accuracy of the complainant’s recollection. This necessitated the complainant being required to be examined by a psychiatrist called by the Crown, whose opinion was that there was nothing to suggest that her accounts would be inaccurate. The trial judge ruled that the evidence of the psychiatrists as to the reliability of her recollection would be admissible, thereby, it could be thought, taking the emphasis from the credibility of the complainant and casting it upon the relative charisma of the two doctors, who will of course have to be called at the two opposite ends of the trial. The last word, in terms of evidence, will go to the defence psychiatrist who has not examined the complainant either at the time she was raped or at any time since, who will say that in his opinion she should not be believed in relation to her identification of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        The second new defence application raised, for the first time, at retrial, concerned the notes of the counsellor who had spoken to the complainant at the hospital to which she was taken soon after she was assaulted. The hospital counsellor, who accompanied the complainant during the medical examination arranged by investigating police, followed up with several brief phone calls to the complainant in the weeks that followed. The defence sought access to the notes and the Department of Health briefed counsel to oppose the access on the basis that as they were records of ‘a sexual assault communication’, they were privileged under the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
        
       
       
        
        After argument, the trial judge permitted the release, to the defence, of some of the material which he ruled may have been relevant to the timing of her recollection of the many events she had related to the police. 
        
       
       
        
        I understand from Ms C’s father that Ms C will not now attend any medical practitioner or other health worker for any reason whatsoever, fearful that her private medical records will be subpoenaed and come into the hands of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        The third new defence application raised for the first time in 2004 concerned the photograph of the accused used by police in the photoboard. The photo was not used for the photoboard identification process until several weeks later, after the accused’s legal representative had advised the police that the accused would not take part in an identification parade. On 20 October 2004 the trial judge ruled that he would not permit the photograph (and therefore the identification process which used it), to be admitted in the trial. He ruled that the accused, in standing still while the photograph was taken, was making an admission or representation and therefore should have been cautioned before it was taken and told of any purpose for which it may be used in the future. 
        
       
       
        
        The judge ruled that the photograph was unfair pursuant to section 90 of the Evidence Act 1995, improperly obtained pursuant to sections 138 and 139 of the same Act and that the photographing should have been videotaped (as an interview is) pursuant to section 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The Crown had submitted that posing for the photograph did not constitute an admission and that the accused was merely supplying a particular of identification. Interestingly the judge said that if the police had merely extracted a still photo of the accused from the video of the search of the premises and used that, there would have been no problem. For my part I must say that as the accused was wearing a peaked cap with a large jacket hood over the top throughout the search, it may not have provided a very useful image.” 
        
       
      
    25 The detailed discussion concluded with the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “As the identification evidence (which had not been found to be deficient in the earlier appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal) is the lynchpin of the Crown case, the decision has been appealed against by the Crown and the Court of Criminal Appeal is yet to deliver its judgment. This issue is of even greater importance because of the fact that the same photograph was used to identify the accused in a separate earlier trial concerning the gang rape of two other young women taken from Chatswood and assaulted in a Greenacre Park. Even though the accused’s appeal against conviction in that matter was not successful, one can envisage that he may re-open that matter on the strength of the ruling about the photograph in the other case if the Crown appeal in this case fails. So G’s matter limps on.” 
        
       
      
    26 In this passage Ms Cunneen told her audience of the Crown appeal in respect of which the decision was reserved and also spoke of another matter where the applicant was convicted of sexual assault. Viewed in the context of the total address she was complaining that the appeal process may enable the applicant to reopen the other matter and challenge the legitimacy of his conviction. 
     
      
    27 After completing her discussion of the trial and appellate proceedings in relation to the applicant and his alleged co-offenders, Ms Cunneen embarked on a discussion of the adversary system and criminal trials. She firstly drew upon the remarks of Sir Daryl Dawson in Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 682. Ms Cunneen said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Our criminal trials in New South Wales are conducted under the adversary system. Unlike the inquisitorial system of the European model, the object of which is to ascertain the truth, the adversarial system is an enquiry into whether the prosecutor has discharged the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        Sir Daryl Dawson in a judgment of the High Court in  
        Whitehorn v The Queen 
         (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 682 said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘A trial does not involve the pursuit of truth by any means. The adversary system is the means adopted, and the judge's role in that system is to hold the balance between the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations. It is not an inquisitorial role in which he seeks himself to remedy the deficiencies in the case on either side. When a party's case is deficient, the ordinary consequence is that it does not succeed. If the prosecution does succeed at trial when it ought not to and there is a miscarriage of justice as a result, that is a matter to be corrected on appeal."" 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        His Honour said nothing about the fact that if the prosecution does not succeed at trial when it ought to have, there is no appeal. Nor does he address the fact that many criminal appeals result in orders for retrials due to very minor matters which seem most unlikely to have made any difference to the verdict of the jury, the tribunal of fact, which does, after all, have the advantage of seeing the witnesses give their evidence in person. Then the witnesses, including the victims themselves, and the accused, have to endure the whole ordeal again, except that it is longer, because there is cross-examination on any variation in even the most irrelevant detail if it varies even slightly from the way it was described in the first trial. 
        
       
       
        
        If justice, in the criminal jurisdiction, means that the innocent are acquitted and the guilty are convicted, the adversarial system may seem routinely to achieve the former but rather often to fail with the latter. 
        
       
       
        
        Its methods often seem, to observers, incompatible with justice. Helen Garner, in her latest book,  
        Joe Cinque’s Consolation  
        said, (at page 159): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘One of the props of the adversarial system, I began to see, is a curious charade that memory is a clear, coherent narrative, a stable and unchanging source of information, so that any deviation from a witness’s original version of an event can be manhandled to look like unreliability, or the intent to deceive … Thus I saw how a Crown witness of what seemed to be transparent sincereity and desire to do right … could go to water under the sustained onslaught of a defence cross-examination.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The most fundamental aphorism of our criminal law is that it is better that 100 guilty men go free than one innocent man stands convicted. In this I believe whole-heartedly. Wrongful conviction is truly a prosectuor’s worst nightmare. The good news is that there has never been a time when it has been less likely to occur in this State.” 
        
       
      
    28 There can be no doubt that these remarks by Ms Cunneen related to the circumstances of the complainant in the applicant’s trial. She had already remarked on the “disastrous effect for the unfortunate complainant” of the decision by this Court to quash the applicant’s original conviction. Her comment on the need for retrials “due to very minor matters which seem most unlikely to have made any difference to the verdict of the jury” can only be understood as a comment, inter alia, on the retrial of the applicant. 
     
      
    29 Ms Cunneen continued with a discussion of the complexities of a modern criminal trial and the need for prosecutors to exercise care in the evidence which they tender. In that discussion she raised the question whether some of the rules as to the admissibility of evidence mean that “public confidence in the courts is now being eroded by the perception that the pendulum has swung rather too far in the direction of the protection of the rights of the accused person.” She questioned whether fairness in the criminal process equates “increasingly, in the courts, to a decision in favour of the defence and against the community.” She illustrated her point by reference to an informal exchange with counsel outside a court room in the precincts of the courts at Darlinghurst. 
     
      
    30 By reference to other matters she has prosecuted, that is matters not involving the applicant, Ms Cunneen emphasised the important part which she believes a plea of guilty can play in the restoration of the health of complainants and their families and the rehabilitation of offenders. 
     
      
    31 She concluded her address with the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The investigating and prosecuting authorities of this State have endured decades of refinement and have assumed stringent controls to ensure absolute transparency, full disclosure and, at every level, fairness towards accused persons. Yet I am informed that in some law schools the teaching of criminal law revolves around the supposed epidemic of the conviction of the innocent. This is very old-fashioned teaching. 
        
       
       
        
        What I wish to challenge you to do, in your practice of the criminal law, is to bring your sense, your humanity and your conscience with you. Justice isn’t achieved by ambush, trickery, dragging proceedings out in a war of attrition with witnesses. It’s achieved by honesty, balance and proportion. As lawyers, you have a power. Be good with it.” 
        
       
       
      Further publicity 
       
      
    32 We have already referred to the fact that Ms Cunneen’s address attracted significant publicity. The newspaper articles were tendered. One of those articles identified its source as Australian Associated Press (“AAP”)and is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “She was raped 25 times by 14 men over six hours, but now the victim of one of Sydney’s worst gang rapes refuses to seek any medical help. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim, known only as Ms C, fears her records will fall into the hands of her accused rapists and the lawyers representing them, the case’s Crown Prosecutor said last night. 
        
       
       
        
        ‘I understand from Ms C’s father that Ms C will not now attend any medical practitioner or other health worker for any reason whatsoever,’ said during her Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture at the University of Newcastle. 
        
       
       
        
        ‘(Ms C is) fearful that her private medical records will be subpoenaed and come into the hands of the accused.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Cunneen said the trial involving Ms C had been hijacked by technicalities in her attackers favour. ‘Justice isn’t achieved by ambush, trickery, dragging proceedings out in a war of attrition with witnesses,’ she said. ‘It’s achieved by honesty, balance and proportion.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Cunneen who rose to prominence during the gang-rape trials, said lawyers had become obsessed with helping criminals avoid jail by finding minor loopholes to appeal jury decisions. 
        
       
       
        
        ‘There seems to be a fashion among some in the criminal justice system for a kind of misplaced altruism that it’s somehow a noble thing to assist a criminal to evade conviction,’ Ms Cunneen said. ‘What must not be lost in the rhetoric of the criminal law and our zeal to afford every possible protection to accused persons is the fact that every time a guilty person is acquitted, the law in a sense has failed the community it exists to serve.’ 
        
       
       
        
        She said appeals on minor matters that would have made little difference to the original verdict were frequently leading to retrials in which victims were forced to relive their ordeals. And she said cross-examiners were often too eager to pounce on the most minor variations of evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Perhaps it’s time for us to consider whether public confidence in the courts is now being eroded by the perception that the pendulum has swung rather too far in the direction of the protection of the rights of the accused person,’ she said.” 
        
       
      
    33 On the same day an article was published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph which contained extracts from Ms Cunneen’s address. On the following day, 12 March 2005, substantial portions of her address were published in the Weekend Australian. Under Ms Cunneen’s “by-line”, with the caption “Balance: Every time a guilty person is acquitted, Cunneen says, the law has failed the community,” the following extracts were published:

       Just say not guilty, bro 
        
       By Margaret Cunneen 
       
       
      Confidence in our courts could be eroded by a perception that the pendulum has swung too far towards protecting the rights of the accused at the expense of victims, argues … 
       
       
        
        THE trials in which I am briefed involve people accused of murder, sexual assaults and armed robberies. They are trials involving crimes where there is usually a victim or victims. The victims have families who are also victims. 
        
       
       
        
        This is particularly so in cases of homicide but is also manifestly the case when someone has been seriously injured or traumatised. For some victims, the anguish continues in a justice system that can give the impression that it is focused on the rights of the accused to the exclusion of the rights of the victims. 
        
       
       
        
        Conversely, defence counsel have a private duty in that they must seek to protect the interests of their clients to the best of their skill and diligence. 
        
       
       
        
        May I bring you up to date on the plight of Ms C, the victim of gang rape in Bankstown [in southwestern Sydney] in August 2000 by 14 men. Ms C was sexually assaulted 25 times in four locations over six hours and was subjected to the gratuitous degradation of being hosed down in a dark, deserted industrial estate on a winter's night. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown case included covert physical and electronic surveillance, telephone intercepts, mobile telephone records giving precise locations of accused persons at relevant times and telephone records establishing association between suspects. The evidence gathered in the course of these areas is valuable because it can support the evidence of the complainant that a particular person was the person responsible for the sexual assault. 
        
       
       
        
        More thorough investigations can, however, have the effect of increasing the complexity of trials. In each additional area of evidence there may be argument about whether it is fair to admit it, whether it has been illegally or improperly obtained and whether its probative value outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. In joint trials, an area of contention will be whether a particular piece of evidence is admissible against only one, or more than one, of the accused, and what can be done to ensure that no prejudice flows to those against whom it is not admissible.  
        
       
       
        
        Where more evidence is tendered and trial judgments made as to admissibility, more avenues of appeal inevitably arise. From a complainant's perspective, it must seem ironic when a successful appeal arises from an area of evidence that would not have existed in a sexual assault case that had been less thoroughly investigated. 
        
       
       
        
        In the case of Ms C, four accused were tried together, BS, MS, MC and MG. One of the four accused tried together, MC, maintained he had sexual intercourse with Ms C, in the company of other men, on the day in question, but that it had been consensual. His car and the locations described by him were consistent with MsC's account. 
        
       
       
        
        She claimed that the man in the passenger seat next to MC had a ponytail and had raped her too. She identified MG from a photoboard as ""the passenger in the red car"". MG and MC were close friends. There were mobile phone calls from relevant locations on the day of and shortly before the rapes. MG, whom police surveillance showed in the passenger seat of MC's red car, wearing a ponytail, on several occasions in the weeks after the rapes, denied any involvement in the offences. The admission, and use made, of one piece of evidence was to have a disastrous effect for the unfortunate complainant, who, on any view of the evidence, had been subjected to an unspeakable ordeal. 
        
       
       
        
        The police arrested MC and interviewed him about several of the Bankstown rapes. His mobile phone was being monitored. During the interview, MC was given a break and left the police station for lunch. He telephoned MG and his calls were intercepted. He is heard to say: ""G…, they've f…ed me, brother. They know your name, I've seen B's name, everyone's name. They know everything, bro."" 
        
       
       
        
        MG replies: ""So what's gunna happen?"" 
         
        MC says: ""I'm at the cop shop."" 
        
       
       
        
        The trial judge ruled that this evidence was admissible to show consciousness of guilt on the part of MC but that it could not be used for this purpose against MG. Nevertheless, the evidence was available to show ""close association"" between two people having an interest in the matter. 
        
       
       
        
        All four accused were found guilty. All four appealed on numerous grounds. Of the seven grounds in MG's appeal, he was successful in establishing that the trial judge had erred in allowing telephone intercept evidence and erred in his directions about that evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        The Court of Criminal Appeal held that MG had not, in the phone call, adopted MC's inculpatory statements or otherwise implicated himself. 
        
       
       
        
        The retrial began in August 2004 when several issues were raised by the defence that had not been the subject of any concern in the previous trial or appeal. 
        
       
       
        
        A psychiatrist was called by the defence to challenge the accuracy of the complainant's recollection. This necessitated the complainant being examined by a psychiatrist called by the Crown, whose opinion was that there was nothing to suggest that her accounts would be inaccurate. The trial judge ruled that the evidence of the psychiatrists as to the reliability of her recollection would be admissible, thereby, it could be thought, taking the emphasis from the credibility of the complainant and casting it on the two doctors. 
        
       
       
        
        The last word, in terms of evidence, will go to the defence psychiatrist, who had not examined the complainant either at the time she was raped or at any time since, who will say that in his opinion she should not be believed in relation to her identification of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        The second new defence application raised at retrial concerned the notes of the counsellor who had spoken to the complainant soon after she was assaulted. The hospital counsellor followed up with several phone calls to the complainant in the weeks that followed. 
        
       
       
        
        The defence sought access to the notes and the health department briefed counsel to oppose the access on the basis that, as they were records of ""a sexual assault communication"", they were privileged. 
        
       
       
        
        After argument, the trial judge permitted the release, to the defence, of some of the material that he ruled may have been relevant to the timing of her recollection of the many events she had related to the police. 
        
       
       
        
        I understand from Ms C's father that MsC will not now attend any medical practitioner or other health worker for any reason whatsoever, fearful that her private medical records will be subpoenaed and come into the hands of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        Each additional trial about the same events yields slight variations in accounts, particularly of complex events involving numerous individuals, cars, locations and offences. 
        
       
       
        
        This leads to lengthier cross-examinations, particularly for the complainant. In this series of cases, Ms C may be able to look forward to the completion of her ordeal of giving witness to these events by the fifth anniversary of their occurrence. The appeals, of course, will go a lot longer. If justice, in the criminal jurisdiction, means that the innocent are acquitted and the guilty are convicted, the adversarial system may seem routinely to achieve the former but rather often to fail 
          
        with the latter. Its methods often seem, to observers, incompatible with justice. Modern prosecutors are now constantly on their guard to ensure that no piece of evidence is of a type that may lead to the risk of wrongful conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        The criminal law now has a patchwork of detailed controls on confessional evidence and evidence that is found to have been illegally or improperly obtained which has developed and been applied ever more rigorously over many years. These developments have been made in the spirit of the duty of courts to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. It has often been said by the High Court, in decisions disallowing a portion or class of evidence in a criminal case, that it is contrary to the public interest to allow public confidence to be eroded by a concern that the court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice. Perhaps it is time for us to consider whether public confidence in the courts is now being eroded by the perception that the pendulum has swung rather too far in the direction of the protection of the rights of the accused person. 
        
       
       
        
        Should we question whether fairness equates to a decision in favour of the defence and against the community, which has a legitimate right to have criminal activity duly recorded, punished and the offender rehabilitated in his own interests and those of his fellow citizens? What must not be lost in the rhetoric of the criminal law and our zeal to afford every possible protection to accused persons is that every time a guilty person is acquitted the law, in a sense, has failed the community it exists to serve. 
        
       
       
        
        Just to utter this unassailable proposition is almost a heresy because it involves looking behind that stalwart of the criminal law that one is innocent until proven guilty. This legal act of faith is in danger of becoming a legal fiction. 
        
       
       
        
        There seems to be a fashion among some in the criminal justice system for a kind of misplaced altruism that it is somehow a noble thing to assist a criminal to evade conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        What good does it do a person, in 2005, to get away with a serious crime? There is no remorse, no introspection, no rehabilitation. For some, there may be a feeling of relief and a determination never to find oneself in the same predicament again. What though of the rest, whose respect for the criminal law is now even lower, having seen it fail and who are emboldened by having defeated it? Obviously the community is in danger from these people. If they offend again, isn't someone accountable, apart from themselves? 
        
       
       
        
        Fear of oppression by the state in criminal proceedings has an honourable and perfectly explicable history. Its genesis is a backlash against barbaric practices that have been gradually ameliorated over hundreds of years -- trial by ordeal, burning at the stake, capital and corporal punishment. Then, there were no second chances. Now there are. 
        
       
       
        
        No court, and no prosecutor, wants to see an offender with any chance of leading a law-abiding life in the future being crushed by an onerous penalty that will leave no hope for the future.

      The Bar rules and Prosecution Guidelines 
       
      
    34 The New South Wales Bar Rules were made under s 57A of the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW). They now derive from s 702 of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW). They apply to any barrister who appears for the Crown in criminal proceedings. Under the heading, Advocacy Rules, are gathered a number of principles which must be followed by barristers, including Rule 20, which provides a prohibition on barristers expressing their personal views in relation to any material evidence or material issue in the case. 
     
      
    35 Under a general heading Integrity of Hearings Rules 59, 60 and 61 provide obligations of a general nature relating to all barristers. Rules 59 and 60 are relevant to the present proceedings. 
     
      
    36 Bar Rule 59 relates to publication by a barrister of material concerning current proceedings and is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        Rule 59 
        
       
       
        
        “A barrister must not publish, or take steps towards the publication of, any material concerning current proceedings in which the barrister is appearing or has appeared, unless: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the barrister is merely supplying, with the consent of the instructing solicitor or the client, as the case may be: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) copies of pleadings or court process in their current form, which have been filed, and which have been served in accordance with the court’s requirements; 
           
          (ii) copies of affidavits or witness statements, which have been read, tendered or verified in open court, clearly marked so as to show any parts which have not been read, tendered or verified or which have been disallowed on objection; 
           
          (iii) copies of the transcript of evidence given in open court, if permitted by copyright and clearly marked so as to show any corrections agreed by the other parties or directed by the court; 
           
          (iv) copies of exhibits admitted in open court and without restriction on access; or 
           
          (v) copies of written submissions, which have been given to the court, and which have been served on all other parties; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) the barrister, with the consent of the instructing solicitor or the client, as the case may be, is answering unsolicited questions from journalists concerning proceedings in which there is no possibility of a jury ever hearing the case or any re-trial and: 
         
          
          (i) the answers are limited to information as to the identity of the parties or of any witness already called, the nature of the issues in the case and the nature of the orders made or judgment given including any reasons given by the court; 
           
          (ii) the answers are accurate and uncoloured by comment or unnecessary description; and 
           
          (iii) the answers do not appear to express the barrister’s own opinions on any matters relevant to the case.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    37 Bar Rule 60 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “60. A barrister will not have breached Rule 59 simply by advising the client about whom there has been published a report relating to the case, and who has sought the barrister’s advice in relation to that report, that the client may take appropriate steps to present the client's own position for publication. 
        
       
      
    38 Particular provision is made by the Rules for the obligation of prosecutors. Under the heading “Prosecutor’s duties” the Rules impose obligations on a prosecutor in the discharge of that role in a particular case. We have included them below. Some of those obligations relate directly to activities carried out in public in the court room, where they can be supervised by the judge. Others relate to activities and decisions made by the prosecutor in the course of the trial, but which may not take place in open court. Of these, the most significant is the obligation which a prosecutor has to ensure that the court is given the benefit of the “whole picture” and not just material which assists the Crown case. We have reproduced the relevant portions of the Rules: 
     
      
       
        
        “62. A prosecutor must fairly assist the court to arrive at the truth, must seek impartially to have the whole of the relevant evidence placed intelligibly before the court, and must seek to assist the court with adequate submissions of law to enable the law properly to be applied to the facts. [ 
        Amended Gazette No. 66 of 20 June 1997 p 4558 
        ] 
        
       
       
        
        63. A prosecutor must not press the prosecution's case for a conviction beyond a full and firm presentation of that case. 
        
       
       
        
        64. A prosecutor must not, by language or other conduct, seek to inflame or bias the court against the accused. 
          
        cf. Ex parte Bread Manufacturers, Re Truth and Sportsman  
        (1937) 37 S.R. (N.S.W.) 242 per Jordan CJ at 248-50, and  
        Attorney-General v. Times Newspapers  
        [1974] A.C. 273 per Lord Diplock at 313 18 
        
       
       
        
        65 A prosecutor must not argue any proposition of fact or law which the prosecutor does not believe on reasonable grounds to be capable of contributing to a finding of guilt and also to carry weight. 
        
       
       
        
        66. A prosecutor must disclose to the opponent as soon as practicable all material (including the names of an means of finding prospective witnesses in connexion with such material) available to the prosecutor or of which the prosecutor becomes aware which could constitute evidence relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused, unless: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) such disclosure, or full disclosure, would seriously threaten the integrity of the administration of justice in those proceedings or the safety of any person; and 
           
          (b) the prosecutor believes on reasonable grounds that such a threat could not be avoided by confining such disclosure, or full disclosure, to the opponent being a legal practitioner, on appropriate conditions which may include an undertaking by the opponent not to disclose certain material to the opponent’s client or any other person. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        66A. A prosecutor who has decided not to disclose material to the opponent under Rule 66 must consider whether: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the defence of the accused could suffer by reason of such non-disclosure; 
           
          (b) the charge against the accused to which such material is relevant should be withdrawn; and 
           
          (c)  
          the accused should be faced only with a lesser charge to which such material would not be so relevant. see, e.g.,  
          Anderson  
          (1991) 53 A Crim R 421 per Gleeson CJ at 449, 453 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        66B. A prosecutor must call as part of the prosecution’s case all witnesses: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) whose testimony is admissible and necessary for the presentation of the whole picture; 
           
          (b) whose testimony provides reasonable grounds for the prosecutor to believe that it could provide admissible evidence relevant to any matter in issue; 
           
          (c) whose testimony or statements were used in the course of any committal proceedings; 
           
          (d) from whom statements have been obtained in the preparation or conduct of the prosecution’s case; unless: 
           
          (e) the opponent consents to the prosecutor not calling a particular witness; 
           
          (f) the only matter with respect to which the particular witness can give admissible evidence has been dealt with by an admission on behalf of the accused; or 
           
          (g) the prosecutor believes on reasonable grounds that the administration of justice in the case would be harmed by calling a particular witness or particular witnesses to establish a particular point already adequately established by another witness or other witnesses; provided that: 
           
          (h) the prosecutor is not obliged to call evidence from a particular witness, who would otherwise fall within (a)-(d), if the prosecutor believes on reasonable grounds that the testimony of that witness is plainly untruthful or is plainly unreliable by reason of the witness being in the camp of the accused; and 
           
          (i) the prosecutor must inform the opponent as soon as practicable of the identity of any witness whom the prosecutor intends not to call on any ground within (f), (g) and (h), together with the grounds on which the prosecutor has reached that decision. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        67. A prosecutor who has reasonable grounds to believe that certain material available to the prosecution may have been unlawfully obtained must promptly: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) inform the opponent if the prosecutor intends to use the material; and 
           
          (b) make available to the opponent a copy of the material if it is in documentary form. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        68. A prosecutor must not confer with or interview any of the accused except in the presence of the accused's representative. 
        
       
       
        
        69. A prosecutor must not inform the court or the opponent that the prosecution has evidence supporting an aspect of its case unless the prosecutor believes on reasonable grounds that such evidence will be available from material already available to the prosecutor.  
        
       
       
        
        70. A prosecutor who has informed the court of matters within Rule 69, and who has later learnt that such evidence will not be available, must immediately inform the opponent of that fact and must inform the court of it when next the case is before the court. 
        
       
       
        
        71. A prosecutor must not seek to persuade the court to impose a vindictive sentence or a sentence of a particular magnitude, but: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) must correct any error made by the opponent in address on sentence; 
           
          (b) must inform the court of any relevant authority or legislation bearing on the appropriate sentence; 
           
          (c) must assist the court to avoid appealable error on the issue of sentence; 
           
          (d) may submit that a custodial or non-custodial sentence is appropriate; and 
           
          (e) may inform the court of an appropriate range of severity of penalty, including a period of imprisonment, by reference to relevant appellate authority.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The Prosecution Guidelines 
       
      
    39 The Prosecution Guidelines of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are issued pursuant to s 13 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. When furnished to a prosecutor, that prosecutor is “subject to the guidelines” s 15(2). They apply to any legal practitioner representing the interests of the Crown. 
     
      
    40 Guideline 2 provides a general statement of the Role and Duties of a Prosecutor. The Guideline stresses that “it is essential that it be carried out with the confidence of the community in whose name it is performed.” 
     
      
    41 Guideline 3 provides that a prosecutor must “act impartially and fairly according to law.” Guideline 18 provides obligation of disclosure. Guideline 19 provides for the relationship between prosecutors and victims of crime. 
     
      
    42 Guideline 32 provides for media contact. Relevant portions of the guidelines are: 
     
      
       
        
        “The functions of the ODPP bring it into contact with the media (which expression includes public reporters and commentators of all kinds). This cannot and should not be avoided as the public have a right to (and should) know what is happening publicly in the criminal justice process. 
        
       
       
        
        However, there is a need to ensure that prosecutors are aware of the limits of their professional obligations and of the rights of others and are sensitive to the way in which their comments and conduct may be reported. 
        
       
       
        
        No public comment concerning matters referred to the ODPP for advice is to be made without the Director’s approval. 
        
       
       
        
        Jury trials require that the evidence be presented in a way that makes it (for the most part) immediately accessible to the media. In committal proceedings in the Local Court that usually will not be the case because of the use of written statements by witnesses. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        All legal practitioners (solicitors and barristers) are bound by Bar Rule 59 of the Barristers' Rules (see  
        Appendix B 
        ) which provides as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        This rule should be read carefully and understood. 
        
       
       
        
        For the purposes of Rule 59, in proceedings in which ODPP lawyers, Crown Prosecutors or private counsel appear, the Director is the ""client"". In special cases where particular sensitivity may be required (and legal practitioners should exercise judgment so as to identify such cases) there may be a need to refer to the Director for instructions on how to proceed; but generally the instructions are as follows. 
        
       
       
        
        1. There is no general obligation to provide information to the media. 
         
        2. There must be compliance with Bar Rule 59, except for the following matters. 
         
        3. Notwithstanding Bar Rule 59, the names and addresses of victims and addresses of other witnesses who are to be or have been called in court proceedings should not be supplied to the media. Information already given in open court (including names and addresses) may be confirmed. Care should also be taken in any case to ensure that the identities of witnesses such as prisoners, informers and others who are giving evidence at some personal risk are kept confidential (so far as is possible) and are not disclosed to the media. 
         
        4. Not withstanding Bar Rule 59, true copies of open exhibits (including paper Photographs and prints, but excluding videotapes and audiotapes of recorded interviews, re-enactments, demonstrations and identifications and digital photographs and recordings) may be inspected by the media after being admitted (if convenient 
        ). 
        
       
       
        
        It is permissible and appropriate if requested by the media for an officer to give his or her name and indicate that the prosecution is being conducted by the ODPP. 
        
       
       
        
        It is not appropriate to discuss with the media the likely result of proceedings or the prospect of appellate proceedings being instituted, a matter being discontinued or an  
        ex officio 
         indictment being filed. 
        
       
       
        
        It is not appropriate to comment to the media on the correctness or otherwise of any determination of a court. 
        
       
       
        
        In trials, rulings on evidence and all matters in the absence of the jury (where one is to be or has been empanelled) should not be commented upon, other than to remind the media that they should not be reported during the trial.  
        
       
       
        
        Discretion should be exercised in relation to sensitive material (eg. medical reports, pre-sentence reports) or material produced under compulsion, where it may be more appropriate to direct inquiries to the court. Medical (including psychiatric and psychological) reports on offenders and victims should not be made available to the media by the prosecution.” 
        
       
      
    43 The obligation not to comment to the media on the correctness of any determination of a court is significant in this case 
     
      
       
      Ms Cuneen’s address and the Bar Rules and Prosecution Guidelines. 
       
      
    44 During the course of her address Ms Cunneen referred to portions of the Bar Rules and DPP Prosecution Guidelines. She was clearly aware of them, and had brought them to mind when preparing her address. Notwithstanding that she was aware of the guidelines she either deliberately, or without sufficient reflection, breached them. 
     
      
    45 The combination of Bar Rule 59 and the Prosecution Guidelines prohibit publication by a prosecutor, or the taking of steps towards publication of any material concerning current proceedings in which the barrister is appearing or has appeared. Ms Cunneen breached the Rule both in relation to the first trial of the applicant, his appeal and subsequent retrial. Her address included an account of the telephone conversation admitted at the first trial but rejected on appeal.  
     
      
    46 When introducing the account of the applicant’s trial and appeal process Ms Cunneen speaks of “the merely presumed innocent” (the full text is at [23] in which she includes the appellant, the inference being that he is in fact guilty. That inference is reinforced by her comments on the outcome of criminal appeals which she said “result in retrials due to very minor matters which seem most unlikely to have made any difference to the verdict of the jury.” This remark follows soon after her discussion of the appellate process which ordered the retrial of the applicant, giving rise to the inevitable inference that the retrial was unnecessary and that the applicant is guilty. 
     
      
    47 The Prosecution Guidelines contain additional specific obligations concerning a prosecutor’s relationship with the media. In particular “comment to the media on the correctness or otherwise of any determination of a court” is “not appropriate.” During the course of her address (the passage is repeated in the publication in the Weekend Australian) and immediately following an account of the circumstances of the applicant’s trial and retrial, Ms Cunneen says “If justice, in the criminal jurisdiction, means that the innocent are acquitted and the guilty are convicted, the adversarial system may seem routinely to achieve the former but rather often to fail the latter.” This can only be construed as reflecting Ms Cunneen’s view that the applicant is guilty. 
     
      
    48 When the applicant’s solicitor’s complaint was considered by the Legal Services Commissioner he found that Bar Rule 59 had been breached and that, if brought before the Tribunal, “it is reasonably likely that … Ms Cunneen would be found guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct.” The Commissioner accepted that Ms Cunneen did not provide the text of her address to AAP. The report in the Australian of 11 March 2005 shows AAP as the source. However, the position is otherwise in relation to the article in the Daily Telegraph. As we have indicated the article in the Weekend Australian of 12 March was published under Ms Cunneen’s name. The Commissioner does not comment on the source of the material for the latter two publications. 
     
      
    49 On the hearing of this application the Crown submitted that the address by Ms Cunneen should be accepted as a legitimate attempt by her to raise serious matters of principle in relation to the administration of the criminal law in an academic forum. It was argued that Ms Cunneen was entitled to put her views on matters of public interest, supported by reference to decisions of the courts. It was submitted that her address was balanced, considering both sides of the issues which she raised. 
     
      
    50 We regret that we cannot accept this description of the address. There is no doubt that Ms C has suffered a terrible ordeal, the impact of which has been exacerbated by the trial and appellate process. Ms Cunneen is quite entitled on an appropriate occasion to draw attention to that ordeal and suggest systemic reform which may ameliorate the problems. But Ms Cunneen’s address went considerably beyond those matters. As we have indicated in our view Ms Cunneen was telling the listener that in her opinion the applicant was guilty and that, although his appeal was successful, it succeeded on minor matters the jury having correctly determined the applicant’s guilt. Although her address was made to an audience comprised of many law students, it was a public occasion on which she chose to speak about trials which attracted considerable publicity. It was inconceivable that, even if she herself took no steps to bring the address to the attention of the press, others would not do so. 
     
      
    51 We also accept that on an appropriate occasion Ms Cunneen was entitled to discuss the relative merits of the adversarial and inquisitorial system of justice. However, in her address she made plain that she was of the opinion that in the case of the applicant the adversarial system had failed, favouring the interests of the applicant over those of the complainant. 
     
      
    52 The Legal Services Commissioner determined that although Ms Cunneen had breached Bar Rule 59 it “was in no way deliberate, being a technical contravention of a complex rule deriving from an error of judgment.” He determined to dismiss the complaint under s 155(3)(b) of the Legal Profession Act 1987. 
     
      
    53 It is not for this Court to review the decision of the Commissioner. However, in our opinion the Rule and Guideline which Ms Cunneen breached are not complex. Her obligations were clear. She was to refrain from publishing material concerning the appellant’s trial, appeal or retrial. The Court of Criminal Appeal had reminded her that she was not to comment to the media on any trial. Notwithstanding that reminder she spoke out on an occasion when she must have realised that there was a real possibility that she would be reported. 
     
      
    54 The Bar Rules and Prosecution Guidelines embody the obligations of a prosecutor which have evolved over time. Although given statutory force they have been developed from practices sanctioned by the courts and have been designed to ensure that an accused person receives a fair trial. The overriding principle is that a prosecutor has a duty to act fairly. Any breach of the Rules or Guidelines by a prosecutor, particularly when the trial process is not complete, may bring into question the integrity of a trial prosecuted by that prosecutor. 
     
      
       
      The decision of the trial judge 
       
      
    55 The applicant originally applied to the trial judge for relief on 13 February 2007. However, his Honour declined to hear the matter and an application was made to this Court. That application was discontinued when the Crown indicated that it would join with the applicant in a submission that the trial judge had jurisdiction to deal with the matter. 
     
      
    56 A further application was heard by the trial judge. It was refused. His Honour gave detailed reasons. 
     
      
    57 The trial judge commenced by reciting the fact that the prosecutor (Ms Cunneen) had prosecuted the accused at his first trial and was later heard to comment on the quality of the police investigation and “the fortitude of the victim” on radio and television. This comment was made after the conclusion of the trial of alleged co-offenders. His Honour referred to Ms Cunneen’s address to the University of Newcastle Law School and found that the “remarks of the present Crown Prosecutor were widely published”, in particular her remarks about the misplaced altruism of some defence counsel received significant exposure in the media. 
     
      
    58 His Honour records the submissions of the applicant which in summary were: 
     
      
    · The Crown Prosecutor has shown such a lack of objectivity that the impartiality of the criminal justice system based on anonymous crown prosecutors presenting on behalf of the State would be compromised if the prosecutor continued to prosecute the trial. 
     
      
    · Because the Crown Prosecutor has effectively given a “public character reference” to the police and the complainant and furthermore is recognised as an “expert commentator in the field” the applicant may because of the pre-trial publicity be denied a fair trial. The balance between the interests of the accused and the community had been irreparably upset by the pre-trial publicity given to the Crown Prosecutor’s remarks (see Jago v The District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23). 
     
      
    59 It was agreed before his Honour that a trial judge in the District Court has the power to order a stay of a trial in the exercise of an implied power to prevent an abuse of process. 
     
      
    60 Having recited counsel’s submissions his Honour turned his mind to the test which should be applied when determining the application. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I consider that the test to be applied in the present circumstances is whether a fair-minded reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that the present Crown Prosecutor should be prevented from prosecuting the accused, see  
        Regina v Khazaal  
        2006 NSW SC 1353. 
        
       
       
        
        There is a duty on a court once an indictment is presented to try any accused person. Section 7 of the  
        Director of Public Prosecutions Act  
        of 1986 provides that the principal function and responsibilities of the Director of Public Prosecutions are, inter alia, to institute and conduct on behalf of the crown prosecutions (whether on indictment or summarily) for indictable offences in the Supreme Court and the District Court. 
        
       
       
        
        The function of the Director of Public Prosecutions so far as conducting prosecutions, are conducted by a crown prosecutor. Section 5 of the  
        Crown Prosecutors Act  
        of 1986 states that the functions of a crown prosecutor are to conduct and appear as counsel in proceedings on behalf of the Director. 
        
       
       
        
        In considering an implied power of the court I have taken into account what was stated by the Court of Appeal in  
        John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited and Anor v District Court of New South Wales  
        2004 New South Wales Court of Appeal at 324, where it was said that the test of implication is a test of necessity. It was stated by the Court of Appeal that the court has powers which are necessary to enable it to act effectively. 
        
       
       
        
        The court does not have power in relation to appointing a crown prosecutor to conduct proceedings on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. That is a power which the Director of Public Prosecutions has. 
        
       
       
        
        The court, as previously stated, has a duty and is obliged to try an accused person on an indictment presented against that person. It is for the crown to adduce evidence in any trial of an accused person upon which a jury, properly directed, can find whether the crown has proved the case against an accused person beyond reasonable doubt. It is for the trial judge to ensure that an accused person has a fair trial. 
        
       
       
        
        The trial judge, and as I have stated the trial is at present listed before me, has the power, and I consider ought to address the jury in this case, that a fair trial can only occur if the jury determines whether or not the crown has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt on evidence properly adduced before it.” 
        
       
      
    61 His Honour then proceeded to consider the matters relevant to the application of the test which he had formulated. After recognising the role of a Crown Prosecutor in adducing evidence at the trial sufficient for a jury properly directed to prove the case against an accused person beyond reasonable doubt, his Honour stated that “it is for the trial judge to ensure that an accused person has a fair trial.” His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I consider that a jury ought be warned at the commencement of a trial that they ought not take into account any information they may have gleaned from any pre-trial publicity in relation to an accused person, and are to determine whether or not the crown has proved its case on evidence before it, and that evidence alone. 
        
       
       
        
        In the circumstances of this case I also consider that a jury ought be advised that they should not connect the accused with any offences on 30 August of 2000 by reason of the racial origin of the accused or the nature of the offences, or of any prior association with other persons in relation to events on 30 August 2000. 
        
       
       
        
        Bearing in mind what the Court of Appeal stated in  
        John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited and Anor v District Court of New South Wales  
        I do not consider that it is necessary in the effective administration of justice to stay the proceedings for the limited time, that is until such time as the Director of Public Prosecutions appoints another Crown Prosecutor. I consider that any perceived problems in relation to a fair trial can be properly addressed by me, the trial judge. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst, because of pre-trial publicity, members of the jury might become aware of the actual name of the Crown Prosecutor, I am not satisfied that a fair minded reasonably informed members of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that the present Crown Prosecutor should be prevented from prosecuting the accused. The court will at all times endeavour to retain the anonymity of the Crown Prosecutor. I consider that the direction that would have to be given in relation to submissions by the crown and in opening address, that that is not the evidence upon which the crown relies, and the jury must determine whether or not the crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence and evidence alone adduced before them, would obviate any risk arising if perchance the name of the Crown Prosecutor came to the knowledge of the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        That would be the case I consider even if a member of the jury was aware of the name of the Crown Prosecutor although again I will be careful to indicate to the jury in waiting that if any member has knowledge of any personality in the court, including the Crown Prosecutor or representatives of the defence, or even myself, they should come forth and indicate same prior to any empanelling of the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        I accordingly dismiss the motion before me.” 
        
       
      
    62 His Honour also determined the second prayer in the motion finding that there had been no conduct by the Crown Prosecutor “in these proceedings to date before me which shows that it would be necessary for the court to restrain the Crown Prosecutor to enable the court to act effectively in the trial of the accused.” 
     
      
       
      Submissions on this application 
       
      
    63 The applicant recognised that when rejecting the applicant’s application the trial judge exercised a discretion. The applicant carries the onus of establishing that a stay or the other relief sought should be granted. His counsel accepted that the decision of the trial judge will only be set aside by this Court if error can be demonstrated: House v R (1936) 55 CLR 499. 
     
      
    64 The applicant submitted that his Honour erred. In summary the submissions were: 
     
      
    · The applicant submitted that although his Honour considered whether the trial process could be effectively managed, and concluded that it could, the trial judge failed to consider whether the conduct of the Crown Prosecutor and the media reporting of her conduct and statements had the consequence that a reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that a trial of the applicant prosecuted by Ms Cunneen would not be fair. The applicant stressed that although his Honour was satisfied that by application of the conventional process and directions justice may be done nothing could cure the fact that the trial would not be seen to be just. By reason of the Crown Prosecutor’s conduct it was submitted that a trial of the applicant which she prosecuted would be seen to lack the “objectivity and impartiality” identified by Sully J as fundamental to the proper functioning of the criminal justice process. 
     
      
    · A fair minded observer would not only conclude that by reason of her conduct a trial prosecuted by Ms Cunneen would not appear to be fair but the situation was aggravated by the fact that the applicant, through his solicitor, had formally complained about her conduct to the relevant bodies. It was submitted that his Honour failed entirely to have regard to this fact. 
     
      
    · The trial judge accepted that there was a risk that the trial may be unfair but that it was a risk which his Honour could manage. It was submitted that rather than rely on the management of the trial, with the risk that a miscarriage of justice may occur requiring yet another trial another prosecutor should be appointed. The trial would inevitably be attended by strong emotional tensions accompanied by constant and sensational media reporting demanding particular discipline of counsel if that atmosphere was not to infect the trial itself. 
     
      
    · His Honour erred by determining that the decided cases including civil trials were of no relevance. The applicant submitted that if the court could exercise control over counsel appearing in a civil proceeding in order to ensure a fair trial, that power was more readily available to protect the fair trial of a citizen charged with an indictable criminal offence. 
     
      
       
      Discussion 
       
      
    65 It is fundamental to our legal system that an accused person is entitled to a fair trial according to law: see Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 56. As Deane J, in Jago, recognised the notion of fairness “which has inspired much of the traditional criminal law of this country defies analytical definition.” Although relevant general propositions may be formulated and examples from past experience identified, an “essentially intuitive judgment” is involved. In Subramaniam v R (2004) 211 ALR 1 the High Court in a joint judgment said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may now also be accepted however that the categories of factual situations which may call for a consideration of the possibility of abuse of process in criminal proceedings are not closed  
        Walton v Gardiner  
        (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393; 112 ALR 289 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ; see also  
        Jago v District Court (NSW)  
        (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 31; 87 ALR 577 at 581-2;  
        Barton v R  
        (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 95-6; 32 ALR 449 at 458-60. As Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said in  
        Walton v Gardiner  
        (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393; 112 ALR 289 at 298, the inherent power of a superior court to stay proceedings on the ground of ‘abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality, may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Fairness or unfairness has been said to defy ""analytical definition"" and to ""involve an undesirably, but unavoidably, large content of essentially intuitive judgment""  
        Jago v District Court (NSW)  
        (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 57; 87 ALR 577 at 601. Deane J in  
        Jago  
        (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 57; 87 ALR 577 at 601 posed some examples of unfairness: default or impropriety on the part of the prosecution in pre-trial procedures, or the concealment of evidence from an accused person that may have assisted his or her defence. Others may include conviction on evidence truly not probative; compulsion upon an accused to incriminate himself or herself; the exaction of involuntary confessions or  
        R v Swaffield  
        (1998) 192 CLR 159; 151 ALR 98 failure to hold committal proceedings  
        Barton v R  
        (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 100-1; 32 ALR 449 at 462-4; the absence of legal representation of an indigent person facing serious criminal proceedings  
        Dietrich v R  
        (1992) 177 CLR 292; 109 ALR 385; and, unreasonable delay.” 
        
       
      
    66 There is more than one interest involved in the trial of a person accused of committing a crime. The Crown has an interest in prosecuting an alleged breach of the law, the accused has an interest in being tried according to law and, as Toohey J said in Jago, there is a “public interest that charges of serious offences be disposed of but that they be disposed of at a hearing which is fair and not oppressive to the person charged” (p 72). 
     
      
    67 An accused is entitled to be tried by a tribunal that is both independent and impartial. The origin of this principle was explained in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2001) 205 CLR 337 where their Honour’s said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Fundamental to the common law system of adversarial trial is that it is conducted by an independent and impartial tribunal. Perhaps the deepest historical roots of this principle can be traced to Magna Carta (with its declaration that right and justice shall not be sold 
          
        ( 
        Holdsworth,  
        A History of English Law 
        , 6th ed (1938), vol 1, pp 57-58)) and the Act of Settlement 1700 (UK) (12 and 13 Wm 3, c 2) (with its provisions for the better securing in England of judicial independence (cf as to the colonies  
        Terrell v Secretary of State for the Colonies  
        [1953] 2 QB 482 at 492-493, per Lord Goddard CJ)). It is a principle which could be seen to be behind the confrontation in 1607 between Coke CJ and King James about the supremacy of law (Holdsworth,  
        A History of English Law 
        , 2nd ed (1937) vol 5, p 430). It could be seen to be applied when Bacon was stripped of office and punished for taking bribes from litigants (Holdsworth,  
        A History of English Law 
        , 2nd ed (1937) vol 5, p 430). Many other examples could be drawn from history. It is unnecessary, however, to explore the historical origins of the principle. It is fundamental to the Australian judicial system.” 
        
       
      
    68 Application of the principle is relatively uncomplicated when the suggestion is of actual bias in a judicial officer or juror. It is more complicated when the suggestion is that the judicial officer or juror is affected by apprehended bias. In that case “the governing principle is that … a judge is disqualified if a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. That principle gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done” p 344. 
     
      
    69 The joint judgment said of the principle “that even the appearance of departure from it is prohibited lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined” p 345. 
     
      
    70 A fair trial requires that not only must justice be done but it must be seen to be done. The appearance of a just trial is as important as its actuality. Without the community’s confidence the system of justice will be diminished to the detriment of the rule of law. 
     
      
    71 Courts have on occasions intervened in a civil trial to deny a party counsel of their choice in order to protect the integrity of the judicial process. In Grimwade v Meagher (1995) 1 VR 446 Mandie J restrained counsel from appearing for a plaintiff in a civil trial when he had previously appeared to prosecute the defendant in separate criminal proceedings. Mandie J concluded that there was “a real and sensible risk of a lack of objectivity” by counsel which gave rise both to a risk of unfairness to the defendant in the civil trial and concern for the integrity of the judicial process and the administration of justice. His Honour concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “A fair minded reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice required that the first defendant be prevented from appearing in the said action because of the real risks of lack of objectivity and of conflict of interest and duty … "" p 455 
        
       
      
    72 The relevant principles were comprehensively considered by Brereton J in Kallinicos & Anor v Hunt & Ors (2005) 64 NSWLR 561. In that case his Honour restrained a solicitor who was likely to be a witness on a controversial issue from acting for a defendant in a civil suit. After a review of the authorities his Honour identified the inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to control its processes in aid of the administration of justice. His Honour determined that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The test to be applied in this inherent jurisdiction is whether a fair minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that a legal practitioner should be prevented from acting, in the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration of justice, including the appearance of justice [76].” 
        
       
      
    73 In R v Khazaal [2006] NSWSC 1353 Whealy J was required to consider the application of these principles in relation to defence counsel at a forthcoming criminal trial. Whealy J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is ample authority to support the proposition that the Court has an inherent jurisdiction to protect the integrity of the judicial process. The principle has often been called in aid in circumstances where a solicitor has acted for two parties on a previous occasion, and is then called upon to act for one of those parties against the other. More often than not, it will arise because of the fact that the solicitor possesses confidential information which may be used adversely to the interests of the former client. Other instances have turned, not so much on the protection of confidential information, but on the Court’s concern to ensure that justice and appearance of justice be done ( 
        Black v Taylor 
         (1993) 3 NZLR 403). In  
        Kallinicos & Anor v Hunt & Ors 
         [2005] 64 NSWLR 561, the Court ordered that a solicitor cease to act for the defendants in a civil suit. This was because the solicitor was likely to be a material witness on a controversial issue of substance; and his evidence and the propriety of his conduct would come under scrutiny, such that he would be in a position in which his interests, the interests of his former client and his obligations to the Court might well be in conflict.  
        
       
       
        
        In that case, Brereton J made a thorough review of the authorities on the point. After examining differences between authorities in New South Wales, Victoria and the United Kingdom, his Honour summarised the current position in New South Wales at para 76 (citations omitted). 
        
       
      
    § However, the Court always had inherent jurisdiction to restrain solicitors from acting in a particular case, as an incident of its inherent jurisdiction over its officers and to control its processes in aid of the administration of justice. 
     
      
    § The testimony to be applied in this inherent jurisdiction is whether a fair minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that a legal practitioner should be prevented from acting, in the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration of justice, including the appearance of justice. 
     
      
    § The jurisdiction is to be regarded as exceptional and is to be exercised with caution. 
     
      
    § Due weight should be given to the public interest in a litigant not being deprived of the lawyer of his or her choice without due cause. 
     
      
    § The timing of the application may be relevant, in that the cost, inconvenience or impracticality of requiring lawyers to cease to act may provide a reason for refusing to grant relief. 
     
      
       
        
        See also  
        Spincode v Look Software Pty Limited 
         [2001] 4 VR 501 at [58]. The categories may overlap because in some cases the possession of confidential information may give the lawyer an unfair or improper advantage such that it would compromise the integrity of the judicial process for him to continue to act. 
        
       
       
        
        A case which may be more useful in the context of the present motion is  
        Grimwade 
        . The first defendant had been retained as senior counsel to prosecute the plaintiff in relation to certain alleged criminal offences involving commercial dishonesty. The prosecutor appeared in the committal proceedings, during an aborted first trial and in a second trial of exceptional and unusual length. The plaintiff was convicted at the conclusion of this trial but successfully appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal where it was decided that a third trial should not be ordered. In handing down its judgment, the Court of Criminal Appeal was critical of the conduct of the prosecutor at the second trial. The first defendant was retained as senior counsel for the plaintiffs in civil proceedings involving related issues. Sir Andrew Grimwade sought an order restraining the first defendant from appearing for those other persons in the civil proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        After collecting and discussing the principles in a number of earlier authorities, Mandie J said at 452: - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘I would respectfully adopt all of the above quoted statements of principle. In my view it cannot be doubted that this Court likewise has an inherent jurisdiction to ensure the due administration of justice and to protect the integrity of the judicial process and as part of that jurisdiction, in an appropriate case, to prevent a member of counsel appearing for a particular party in order that justice should not only be done but manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done. The objective test to be applied in the context of this case is whether a fair minded reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice required that counsel be so prevented from acting, at all times giving due weight to the public interest that a litigant should not be deprived of his or her choice of counsel without good cause.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Mandie J came to the conclusion that a fair-minded and informed observer would apprehend a real risk that the former prosecutor would, albeit unintentionally, lack the objectivity required of counsel in order to perform his duty to his client and to the Court. His Honour held that, “in the unique, extraordinary and highly exceptional circumstances”, the former prosecutor should be restrained from appearing. 
        
       
       
        
        It is agreed between the parties that the  
        Grimwade 
         test should be applied to the circumstances of this matter.” 
        
       
      
    74 In Szabo (2000) 112 A Crim R 215 the Court of Appeal in Queensland considered an appeal from a person convicted after trial of burglary and rape. Defence counsel had not disclosed to the appellant that he had previously had an intimate relationship with the prosecutor for which there was a reasonable possibility of renewal. 
     
      
    75 Thomas JA records the submission by the appellant that the principles of the test of apparent bias should be applied, not only to decision makers but also to counsel appearing for a party at the trial. However, his Honour comments that the authorities dealing with apparent bias “do not automatically accommodate” to the case the court was required to consider. Instead his Honour looked to the power of the court to set aside a conviction when it considers that there had been a miscarriage of justice. De Jersey CJ agreed with the reasons of Thomas JA.  
     
      
    76 Davies JA differed from the majority accepting that the appropriate test was “whether a fair minded person, in the position of either the appellant or a member of the public, might reasonably apprehend, that because of defence counsel’s relationship with the prosecutor or its consequences, the appellant was deprived of a fair trial Livesey v NSW Bar Association (1983) 151 CLR 288 at 294-295; Webb & Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 53; 265 [15]”. 
     
      
    77 All members of the court agreed that the appellant’s conviction should be quashed. Although hesitant to intervene, Thomas JA ultimately concluded that the “importance of maintaining full confidence in the integrity and impartiality of those entrusted with the administration of justice, and in particular counsel” should inform the test to be applied [80]. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of this application 
       
      
    78 In this state trials on indictment are prosecuted by barristers appointed by the Director of Public Prosecutions to perform that role in a particular case. In order to protect the integrity of the trial process and ensure that it is not only fair, but seen to be fair, evidentiary and procedural rules have been provided by statute and adopted by the courts. They include discrete obligations which are imposed upon a crown prosecutor. We have already discussed those obligations. 
     
      
    79 In Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 Deane J exposed the independent nature of the prosecutor’s function in a trial under the adversary system. One important element of that role is that it is for the prosecutor to decide which witnesses should be called. Deane J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Under the adversary system which operates in a criminal trial in this country, it is for the Crown and not the judge to determine what witnesses are called by the Crown. That is not to say that the Crown is entitled to adopt the approach that it will call only those witnesses whose evidence will assist in obtaining a conviction. Prosecuting counsel in a criminal trial represents the State. The accused, the court and the community are entitled to except that, in performing his function of presenting the case against an accused, he will act with fairness and detachment and always with the objectives of establishing the whole truth in accordance with the procedures and standards which the law requires to be observed and of helping to ensure that the accused's trial is a fair one. The consequence of a failure to observe the standards of fairness to be expected of the Crown may be insignificant in the context of an overall trial. Where that is so, departure from those standards, however regrettable, will not warrant the interference of an appellate court with a conviction. On occasion however, the consequences of such a failure may so affect or permeate a trial as to warrant the conclusion that the accused has actually been denied his fundamental right to a fair trial. As a general proposition, that will, of itself, mean that there has been a serious miscarriage of justice with the consequence that any conviction of the accused should be quashed and, where appropriate, a new trial ordered (Criminal Law Consolidation Act, s. 353; Reg. v. Clewer (1953) 37 Cr App R 37, at pp. 39-40). If there be exceptions to that general proposition, they do not presently occur to me.” 
        
       
      
    80 The duties of a prosecutor were considered by the Court of Appeal of Victoria in Cannon & Anor v Tahche (2002) 5 VR 317.  
     
      
    81 It will be apparent that there are two interests which the law must consider. One is the right of an accused person or litigant to a fair trial. That interest will be protected so that the trial is conducted according to law and is decided by a tribunal free of bias. The law will also ensure that the trial process appears to the ordinary fair minded person to be fair. Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.  
     
      
    82 This Court has recently had occasion to consider the appropriate behaviour of a crown prosecutor in the course of a trial. Many of the decisions are collected in Livermore v R (2006) NSWCCA 334. Central to the obligations of a crown prosecutor during a trial is that he or she “fairly and impartially exhibit all the facts to the jury” R v McCullough (1982) 6 A Crim R 274. 
     
      
    83 However, because of the special role of crown prosecutors in the criminal justice system they are subject to obligations beyond the court room, both before and after any trial. The relevant Bar Rules and Prosecution Guidelines have been made with the object of ensuring that crown prosecutors conduct themselves in a manner which will ensure the integrity of the criminal justice system. A breach of them may diminish public confidence in that system. In an exceptional case it may be necessary for the courts to intervene to ensure that public confidence is maintained. 
     
      
    84 The trial judge said that he would apply the test of whether a fair minded reasonably informed member of the public would consider that the proper administration of justice required that Ms Cunneen be removed as the prosecutor. However, his Honour did not, in our opinion, consider all of the factual matters which required consideration in the application of that test. We accept that the trial judge does have a capacity to control the course of the trial and, to some extent the conduct of counsel including the prosecutor. However, as recent experience in this Court demonstrates, there have been occasions when prosecutors have fallen short of the standard of conduct required of them in court, resulting in a miscarriage of justice, requiring an order for a new trial. These problems usually have their source in the excessive zeal of the prosecutor, who in an endeavour to persuade the jury of the accused’s guilt leaves aside the fairness and detachment required. 
     
      
    85 We have previously concluded that Ms Cunneen breached both Bar Rule 59 and the Prosecution Guidelines. She both published material concerning a current trial and commented in a forum, where the media would be likely to take up her comments, on the correctness of judgments of the court. The breaches were either deliberate or made without adequate reflection as to the obligations of a crown prosecutor. 
     
      
    86 The statements which Ms Cunneen made have a number of consequences. They demonstrate a lack of detachment from the case she was required to prosecute. There is no difficulty in Ms Cunneen privately holding the view that the applicant is guilty. However, her public expression of that view displayed partiality and potentially compromised her capacity to fairly prosecute on behalf of the Crown. It had the consequence that a fair minded person might reasonably conclude that her conduct of the prosecution would be directed to vindicating her publicly expressed view. When a prosecutor on a public occasion expresses the view that a person is guilty, although they have not been tried according to law, the later prosecution of that person by that prosecutor tends toward oppression which is the antithesis of a fair trial. 
     
      
    87 The difficulty created by a breach of Bar Rule 59 when an advocate publicly speaks of the merit of a client’s case before trial may not be so acute in ordinary civil litigation. Even then the Rule prohibits such statements in order to ensure the appearance of detachment and objectivity. The position is significantly different when a prosecutor breaches the Rule. As we have outlined a crown prosecutor is afforded a unique role in a criminal trial. He or she has the carriage of the Crown case and has the responsibility of making decisions as to the evidence which is placed before the court. Unlike some other jurisdictions, and in particular, the inquisitorial system a judge has little if any role to play in the evidence produced at the trial see R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563. 
     
      
    88 That responsibility must be approached with fairness and detachment with the objective of establishing the truth. If, by reason of their prior conduct, a crown prosecutor has demonstrated that in a particular case they may not be able to discharge their obligations in that manner the legitimacy of the prospective trial will be compromised. This is not to say that in a particular case those obligations will not be appropriately discharged, but a reasonable observer would conclude that they may not be. 
     
      
    89 That risk is more acute in this case. As we have indicated the applicant’s solicitor complained, inter alia, to the Legal Services Commissioner about her conduct. Although the complaint was dismissed and described as an error of judgment, the Commissioner found that, if the matter came before the Tribunal, Ms Cunneen would be likely to be found guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct. 
     
      
    90 There could be no doubt that a judge who had been the subject of a serious complaint by a litigant to the NSW Judicial Commission could not sit in judgment of a case brought by that person. Similarly as the obligation resting upon a prosecutor is one of fairness and detachment, the fact that a complaint was made to the Commissioner which was not frivolous or vexatious, would give rise to a concern in the mind of a reasonable person that the Crown Prosecutor may not maintain the detachment required if the accused is to have a fair trial. 
     
      
    91 That is not to say that in any case where complaint is made about a prosecutor that person must stand aside. Spurious complaints made for ulterior purposes must always be a possibility. Each case requires its own consideration. 
     
      
    92 There are further matters. By speaking publicly as she did Ms Cunneen revealed her considerable sympathy for the complainant in her ordeal. That Ms Cunneen, or any person, should hold those views is understandable. However, by publicly expressing them, and at the same time mounting an argument that the criminal justice system was both weighted inappropriately in favour of accused persons and imposed unacceptable burdens on complainants, Ms Cunneen discarded the prosecutor’s obligation of detachment. 
     
      
    93 In the course of argument in this Court the Crown submitted that it was imperative that Ms Cunneen prosecute the applicant’s retrial. The complainant was said to be “still psychologically vulnerable and thus still needs to maintain the continuity of the prosecutor at the trial.” Later it was submitted that the complainant’s “well being might be dependent on the confidence she has in the particular Crown Prosecutor.” 
     
      
    94 There are various mechanisms by which the community seeks to ameliorate the harm occasioned to victims of crime and restore their health if it has been damaged. These include the Witness Assistance Service in the Office of the Director. The need for those mechanisms cannot be underestimated or their contribution to the lives of victims undervalued. However, it is not for the Crown Prosecutor to take a public role in supporting the complainant as against the accused at a criminal trial. Where this occurs any reasonable person would seriously doubt whether the process is fair. 
     
      
    95 This case cannot be determined by consideration of the trial judge’s ability to control the actions of the Crown Prosecutor in court. It requires consideration of whether a reasonably informed fair minded person would conclude that, if prosecuted by Ms Cunneen, the trial of the applicant would be fair. In our opinion, because of her public statements that person would inevitably conclude that she may not discharge her obligations with appropriate fairness and detachment. Accordingly, in the unusual circumstances of this case if Ms Cunneen were to prosecute the applicant’s trial, justice would not be seen to be done. 
     
      
    96 It is not without significance that if Ms Cunneen does not prosecute the applicant’s trial the Director will be able to appoint another prosecutor from any number of experienced and competent prosecutors. The evidence before this Court indicates that the complainant will not give oral testimony. The transcript of her evidence at the previous trial will be tendered. If we had any doubt whether the present circumstances justified the intervention of this Court these further matters would lead us to resolve them in favour of intervention. 
     
      
       
      Relief 
       
      
    97 The Court of Criminal Appeal exercises an appellate jurisdiction with respect to any interlocutory judgment or order (s 5F(3)). An order with respect to a stay of proceedings in a criminal trial is such an order. Whether the District Court has power to restrain a prosecutor from appearing at a trial and, if so, whether the exercise or failure to exercise that power is reviewable by the Court of Criminal Appeal raises questions of some difficulty which need not be determined. An order staying the trial, unless prosecuted by a different prosecutor, is all that is necessary in the present case. 
     
      
    98 Although the nature of any relief available from the Court of Criminal Appeal exercising jurisdiction pursuant to s 5F may be unclear the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to control the process of any trial to ensure that it is fair is undoubted. We have previously discussed the relevant authorities.  
     
      
    99 If it were necessary we are of the opinion that, exercising the powers of the Court of Appeal, this Court could restrain a crown prosecutor from prosecuting a particular trial. Before that could be considered the prosecutor should be joined as a party to the proceedings. 
     
      
    100 However, the concern of this Court is confined to ensuring that the trial of the applicant is fair and will be seen to be fair. That object can be achieved by a temporary stay of the trial. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted and the appeal upheld. 
       
      2. Order that the trial of the applicant be stayed until a Crown Prosecutor other than Ms Cunneen is appointed to prosecute the trial.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Jacqueline Moreira appears for sentence today after having been committed for sentence on a charge of being an accessory after the fact to an attempted armed robbery. 2 The offender and her then partner went to a florist’s shop. Unbeknownst to the offender her partner intended to rob the florist when he went inside. Whilst there he presented a pair of scissors to the proprietor. She not unnaturally became frightened and called out to her husband, who was also working in the shop. When the victim’s husband came from the rear of the shop the offender’s partner ran away. As he was leaving the shop it became apparent to the offender that he had done something wrong. It was her action in then attempting to assist him by driving away from the area which forms the basis of the present charge. In fact the offender was unable to start her car, although she tried for sometime, and eventually both she and her partner ran away. The offender later returned to her car after calling the NRMA. 3 The attempted armed robbery was a serious offence involving the presentation of a weapon, although that offender gave up as soon as he was confronted by the victim’s husband. He received from his Honour Judge Geraghty, a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of twelve months with a head sentence of two and a half years. When the present offender appeared before his Honour he remanded her on a s 11 bond, conditional on the offender residing at a treatment program run by the Salvation Army. His Honour apparently did this because of material suggesting that the offender appreciated a link between her offending and her drug addiction and because the offender was in the middle of obtaining treatment and counselling for her drug addiction. I say his Honour apparently did this because no remarks on sentence have been placed before me.4 I am told that attempts were made to have this matter placed before his Honour Judge Geraghty so that he could proceed to finally sentence the offender in the light of the new material which has become available since Judge Geraghty put the offender on the s 11 remand. However, the registry were less than helpful when Mr Elks who appears for the offender attempted to make those arrangements. Of course it should have gone before his Honour Judge Geraghty. Not only did he sentence the principal offender, but much more importantly it was he who decided to put this offender on the s 11 bond. 5 I will ask that these remarks on sentence are placed before the registry so that this does not happen again. When I was first alerted to this issue I did consider adjourning the matter so that his Honour could proceed to sentence the offender but this would work hardship towards the offender who deserves to know as soon as possible what her punishment would be. Accordingly I decided to deal with the matter myself. As it turns out the appropriate outcome is not a matter of controversy with both Mr Elks and the Crown agreeing on the sentence that should be imposed. 6 I received an updated presentence report today which shows that the offender completed the Cello Farm program late last year. She has continued to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings and she receives assistance to remain drug free. The author of the presentence report says that the offender is committed to remaining drug free and considers that the Salvation Army saved her life through the treatment program which she attended. 7 At one stage she was living with her parents who support her, but is now living independently of them with her two and a half year old daughter on the Central Coast. 8 This is a case where the offender needs to be punished for what she did, a matter which she herself recognises. It is also the case where the offender has achieved, rather than just promised, a substantial measure of rehabilitation. She is to be congratulated for the attitude that she has taken, both towards her past and her future. 9 In the presentence report it appears that the offender considered it appropriate that she be given a community service order placed with the Salvation Army so that she could repay that organisation the debt that she considers she owes them. It is a matter of some fortune that I consider that that is the appropriate way of dealing with this matter, as do both Mr Elks and theCrown. 10 The offender is ordered to perform 300 hours community service. For the purpose of the administration of the order you are to report to the Wyong office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days from today. I recommend that if possible you are placed with the Salvation Army in order to perform your community service with them. It is a condition of your community service that you undergo testing including regular urinalysis and that you do not use any form of illegal drugs during the period that the community service order remains in force. 11 Ms Moreira what I’ve just done is put you on a community service order. You have to perform the work that is directed of you and very importantly you have to remain drug free. You will be tested regularly in order to ensure that you are. If you are found to have used drugs, that will be a breach of the community service order and you can be brought back before me, not Judge Geraghty but me, and I will sentence you afresh for the crime you committed, you understand?12 OFFENDER: Yeah.

     HEADNOTE 
     
     
      
    FactsThe appellant was found guilty by a jury of eight counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). An offence under s 97(1) carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 20 years. His Honour, Judge Dodd, sentenced the appellant to a total effective sentence of 12 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 10 years. The offences had been committed in the company of another offender, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years 3 months for these and other offences.  
     
      
    The appellant appeals against his conviction on the basis that an irregularity occurred during the course of the jury’s deliberation when the jury found a syringe in the pocket of the appellant’s jacket which was an exhibit in the case and that his Honour erred in failing to discharge the jury. The appellant also sought leave to appeal against his sentence. In particular, the appellant contended that his Honour erred in failing to correctly apply the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), failing to impose individual sentences in respect of each offence and that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive having regard to the principles of totality, parity and the “general tariff” for sentences for the offences of which the appellant was convicted. 
     
      
    Held: On conviction Per Beazley JA (Hislop J agreeing): (i) When an irregularity has occurred in the course of the jury’s deliberation a court must ask itself whether it can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdicts, and that the jury would have returned the same verdict if the irregularity had not occurred. This question is to be answered in light of the directions which the trial judge gave when the irregularity came to the judge’s attention.

      R v Lansdell  
      (NSWCCA, 22 May 1995, unreported) 
      
    (ii) The directions given by his Honour were adequate and there was no error in not discharging the jury. Hulme J dissenting:  
     
      
    (iii) The system recognises that there are bounds beyond which a jury cannot be expected, or asked to, to go. For this reason, the criminal appeal courts have developed the notion that no direction to the jury could have cured the damage. Implicit in this is the recognition that there are occasions when the legal system accepts that a jury will not, or cannot, be expected to, comply with the directions of the trial judge. The circumstances here fell within that exceptional category. As a result, no directions were capable of overcoming the prejudice which arose from the presence of the syringe.  
     
      
      R v Lansdell  
      (NSWCCA, 22 May 1995, unreported);  
      R v K  
      (2003) 59 NSWLR 431 
      
     (iv) Even if error is found, s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides that the Court may dismiss an appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. The evidence against the appellant on the charges of which he was convicted was so compelling that conviction was inevitable. Therefore, it is appropriate to apply the proviso of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act.

      (2001) 208 CLR 593; [2001] HCA 72 
      
    Held: On sentencePer Beazley JA (Hulme and Hislop JJ agreeing): 
     
      
    (v) When sentencing the appellant, s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) required his Honour first to set the term of the sentence and then set the non-parole period in imposing sentence in respect of each offence. His Honour correctly applied s 44 when imposing sentence.  
     
      
    (vi) The foundation for the concept of parity of sentencing co-offenders lies in considerations of fairness and whether a legitimate sense of grievance is engendered by comparison of the offender’s sentence and that of any co-offender. Having regard to the equal involvement of the appellant and his co-offender in the commission of the offences and to their individual overall circumstances, the appellant could not have a legitimate sense of grievance in relation to his sentence.

    (viii) In this case, the trial judge sentenced separately for each offence. However, his Honour imposed an escalating scale of sentence, which although not wrong in principle, resulted in a manifestly excessive sentence.

    (ix) While an understanding of sentences imposed by courts for the same offence by different offenders is necessary to promote consistency, the court is ultimately to consider the sentence to be imposed on the individual offender.

    (x) As there was no significant difference in the seriousness of each offence, the individual sentences imposed of 7 years, 8 years and 9 years respectively for counts 2 and 5, 6-8 and 9 and 10 were not to be accounted for by the fact of accelerating criminality, and revealed error in the sentencing process.

    (xii) The extent of the partial accumulation of sentences imposed by his Honour contributed to the overall effective sentence imposed being manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    (xiii) The trial judge was not obliged to find special circumstances because of the accumulation of sentences.

    Per Hulme J dissenting:(xiv) In R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; [1999] NSWCCA 111, the court provided a guideline as to the appropriate sentence for offences having a number of identified characteristics. Having regard to the differences between the appellant’s circumstances and those identified by the court, it is impossible to say that the sentences for counts 2 and 5 are manifestly excessive. The circumstances of the appellant were substantially worse and require a higher sentence for each offence. (xv) In sentencing the appellant the trial judge fell into error in finding that there was no evidence that the appellant committed the offences for the purpose of obtaining funds to fund a drug addiction. 
     
      
    (xvi) The sentences of 8 and 9 years imposed on counts, 6-8 and 9 and 10 respectively were outside the legitimate exercise of his Honour’s discretion. The offences the subject of these counts were too far from a “worst case” of offences under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) to justify such a penalty.

     QING AN v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 25 October 2004, Qing An (the appellant) was found guilty by a jury of eight counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act). An offence under s 97(1) carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years.  
     
      
    2 The offences occurred between 16 August 2002 and 1 September 2002. Each involved the robbery of cash and personal effects, such as watches, mobile phones and jewellery from massage parlours in various locations in Sydney. The offensive weapon used in three of the offences (being Counts 1, 2 and 5) was a knife. The offensive weapon in the remaining five offences (being Counts 6-10) was an imitation pistol.  
     
      
    3 The appellant had been charged with a total of ten offences. He pleaded not guilty to each offence and was tried by a jury before his Honour Judge Dodd in the Sydney District Court. During the course of the trial, his Honour directed verdicts of not guilty in respect of Counts 3 and 4. The guilty verdicts were returned on the remainder, as I have indicated. His Honour Judge Dodd sentenced the appellant to a total effective sentence of 12 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 10 years (although in his Remarks on Sentence his Honour stated he had sentenced the appellant to a total aggregate sentence of 13 years 3 months). 
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals against his conviction on the basis that an irregularity occurred during the course of the jury's deliberation and that the trial judge erred in failing to discharge the jury.  
     
      
    5 The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    6 The appeal and application for leave to appeal against sentence were filed out of time. The appellant seeks an extension of time in relation to each.  
     
      
    7 All but one of the offences were committed in the company of John Shaopeng Yin (Yin). Yin pleaded guilty to the offences, which were charged differently to those laid against the appellant, and was sentenced by her Honour Judge Tupman in the Parramatta District Court on 10 December 2003, to a term of imprisonment of 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years 3 months. It will be necessary to return to Yin’s sentence as the appellant claims that there was a lack of parity as between his sentence and that imposed on Yin so as to give rise to a legitimate sense of grievance.  
     
      
       
      Application for extension of time 
       
      
    8 On 20 March 2006, the appellant filed a notice of application for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal and to file an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The application was accompanied by a letter from his solicitors. Subsequently, the contents of that letter have been amplified in an affidavit of Camilla Taylor, solicitor. Ms Taylor, in effect, provides a chronology of the steps taken in relation to the bringing of an appeal following the appellant’s conviction. In brief, those steps involved the filing of a notice of intention to appeal, lodged on 20 December 2004 and a request shortly thereafter to the District Court of New South Wales requesting a transcript. Only a portion of the transcript was provided, requiring a follow-up letter. On 22 March 2005, senior counsel was briefed to advise on the prospects of success.  
     
      
    9 In July 2005, senior counsel advised that there was a jury irregularity. In his advice, senior counsel drew attention to the fact that certain material was not included in his brief, including trial exhibits and the outcome of a series of interlocutory applications. Senior counsel advised that the latter material might reveal further grounds for appeal. Ms Taylor said that a decision was taken that the appeal would be filed, notwithstanding the absence of material, and that the grounds of appeal would be revisited at a later time, should that become necessary.  
     
      
    10 At some time between July and October 2005, and I infer, closer to October, senior counsel advised that he was not able to complete the matter due to his work load. Thereafter, following a grant of legal aid in October 2005, alternate senior counsel was briefed. In February 2006, that senior counsel informed the appellant’s solicitors that he was unable to complete the work due to his busy work load. The matter was then returned to the original senior counsel briefed in the matter. In February 2006, senior counsel prepared grounds of appeal in relation to the jury irregularity alone, as the material previously sought from the District Court remained outstanding. However, the notice of appeal was then filed, notwithstanding the absence of this material, which was received some time later.  
     
      
    11 The appellant had 28 days in which to appeal against conviction and to make an application for leave to appeal against sentence: the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (the Criminal Appeal Act), s10(1)(a). The solicitors filed a notice of intention to appeal on 20 December 2004. This was 28 days outside the 28 day time period specified in s 10(1)(a). Thereafter, appropriate steps were taken to obtain the relevant material necessary for the purposes of preparing the Notice of Appeal. However, there was no evidence before the Court of any steps taken to follow up senior counsel briefed to draft the Notice of Appeal. Likewise, once the brief was returned by the first senior counsel and a second senior counsel briefed, there was no evidence of steps taken to seek to ensure that the Notice of Appeal was drafted promptly. Nor is there any evidence in this case of communication with the appellant advising the appellant of the present status of the matter, or from the appellant requesting advice as to what the present status was. Overall, save for the filing of the notice of intention to appeal and the application for transcript, the approach taken to filing the appeal documents might properly be described as dilatory.  
     
      
    12 Having said that, the cause for the delay was very much the failure of both senior counsel to attend to the brief promptly. Had it not been for the fact that the notice of intention to appeal was filed within a time that was likely to attract the exercise of the Court’s discretion to extend the time, and that the request for the transcript was made within a reasonable time, I would have been inclined to refuse the extension of time. However, given that those steps were taken in a time that does not attract censure, and taken in conjunction with the fact that the appeal raised an arguable question, I would extend the time in which to file the appeal and the application for leave to appeal against sentence until 20 March 2006. 
     
      
       
      Appeal against conviction 
       
      
    13 The trial commenced on 5 October 2004. The jury commenced deliberating on Friday 22 October 2004, and returned the following Monday, 25 October 2004, to continue their deliberations.  
     
      
    14 The jury had with it in the jury room a grey-coloured suit jacket (Exh U), which was identified by witnesses at the trial as being like the jacket worn by the appellant during some of the robberies. The jacket had been seized from the appellant's home when it was searched at the time of the appellant's arrest on 25 October 2002.  
     
      
    15 The appellant had given evidence in his defence. During the course of his evidence he was asked about the jacket. He said that he and his brother had purchased the jacket from a store called, as he could remember it, ""Boys to Men"" at Fairfield, ""seven, eight months or one year before I was arrested"". He said that both he and his brother wore the jacket because they were both the same height. In his cross-examination, the appellant agreed that in August 2002, when the offences were being committed, his brother was in Melbourne.  
     
      
    16 Prior to 11am on the morning of 25 October 2004, the trial judge informed the Crown Prosecutor and the solicitor for the accused that he had been advised by the Court Officer that the jury had informed him that ""when they'd upended the jacket … a syringe fell out"".  
     
      
    17 The appellant's solicitor thereupon made an application for the discharge of the jury. He said that it was “highly prejudicial” to have such an item before the jury; that there was no evidence of anything relating to a syringe, nor was there any evidence of an illness that related to the use of a syringe that might have explained its presence. He submitted that it would have become embedded in the mind of the jury that the appellant may be involved in drugs and that the jury might then deduce that the appellant had a motive for the robbery.  
     
      
    18 The application was opposed by the Crown Prosecutor. He acknowledged that the syringe did not form any part of the evidence tendered by the Crown and that it was only the jacket that had been tendered in the Crown case. He also noted that there had been no evidence that the appellant was in any way using drugs and that the only evidence in the trial in relation to drugs was that the appellant had heard ""on the grapevine"" that his co-accused Yin was possibly a drug user. He submitted that the matter could properly be dealt with by an appropriate direction. The Crown Prosecutor outlined the direction which he submitted would suffice, including that the jury were not to speculate as to why the syringe was in the jacket. He suggested that the trial judge could give a number of reasons why it was not proper to speculate, including the fact that the syringe could have belonged to somebody else or it could have been used, for example, for proper medical purposes.  
     
      
    19 The appellant's solicitor resisted the proposition that the irregularity could be dealt with by a direction to the jury. He pointed out that there were not many medical conditions in which people legitimately self-medicate using a syringe except perhaps, diabetes; that drug users and drug addicts are rated lowly in public perception; and, relevantly, that given the evidence relating to Yin's drug use, the finding of the syringe in the pocket of the appellant's jacket linked Yin and the appellant in a way that no evidence during the trial had done so far.  
     
      
    20 The trial judge decided that the prejudice that was potentially caused by the finding of the syringe in the jacket could be cured by an appropriate direction to the jury and thus gave the following direction: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Members of the jury thank you. I've brought you back into court because I need to address a matter which has arisen this morning. You have quite rightly brought to the attention of the Court through the court officer that you found a syringe, which I gather fell out of the jacket which is exhibit U. I've had the syringe identified for the purpose of the court record and it's marked as MFI 14. I have certain things to say to you about that find by you. And therefore I'd ask you to listen very carefully to what I now have to say to you about that.  
         
         
        Simply put you must ignore that find. I know that might be difficult to do. It's very easy for me to say, but in your deliberations about this case you must ignore it. But I can't leave it just at that. I should in fairness to you give you an explanation as to why I say that. The first reason why I say that is that it is not evidence in this case. It was not part of the tender, by the Crown, of that jacket. It was never intended to be part of the tender by the Crown of that jacket and certainly not consented to as part of the tender by Mr Little on behalf of the accused. I should just say Mr Little is not able to be present in court right now, but his instructing solicitor, Mr Watterson, is here on his behalf representing the accused at the moment. So for that reason, as a matter of law, I direct you to ignore that finding of the syringe.  
         
         
        Secondly, it never was any part of the Crown case against the accused that anything connected with a syringe, and this syringe in particular, should be in evidence. I have to be realistic, it may have occurred to some of you that this syringe has been used or could be used in relation to drug use. It has never been part of the Crown case that the accused was a drug user or was connected with drug use or that any of the crimes alleged against him had any relationship to drug use. That has never been part of the Crown case and therefore in particular you must put that out of your minds. You must not speculate about that or any other possible reason for the syringe being in the jacket or with the jacket, I don't know exactly where it was. But you must put that or any other speculation out of your minds.  
         
         
        It is possible of course for syringes to be used legitimately for self-medication in respect of some medical conditions. You've heard that the accused was in fact ill during the period that these armed robberies took place. That of course is one possible explanation, if indeed it was his. There is absolutely no evidence, however, that it was his or that he ever knew that it was there. It's possible that someone else may have put the syringe in that jacket, either before the police seized it or afterwards for that matter. I don't make any allegation about anyone else, but it is possible that someone may have put the syringe with the jacket or in the jacket by mistake after it was seized by the police. They go to police stations, and are kept in police stations where there are many exhibits in many prosecutions kept. And it's just possible, as I say I make no allegation against anybody, but it's just possible that the syringe was placed with the jacket after it was seized. 
         
         
        Members of the jury I've just gone through a number of possibilities of speculation as to how that syringe may have got with the jacket. I've done that not to encourage you to speculate about it, but to direct you not to speculate about the reasons and to illustrate why speculation would be wrong and would be futile in the circumstances of this case. And therefore as I say I stress and direct you that you must not speculate about where that syringe came from or why it was there, whether the accused knew it was there or not or anything to do with that syringe. You must put it completely out of your minds. It has absolutely nothing to do with this case and it must form no part of your consideration in relation to any of the charges in this case. Mr Crown anything further?"" 
        
       
      
    21 In this appeal, senior counsel for the appellant and the Crown agree as to the principles to be applied when an irregularity has occurred in the course of the jury's deliberation. The relevant principle was stated in R v Marsland (NSWCCA, 17 July 1991, unreported). In that case, a forensic report received into evidence made an allegation of sexual misconduct by the appellant against another person in respect of which the accused had been tried and acquitted. The jury asked a question as to the identity of the other person and as to the reason why that person had not given evidence. The trial judge declined to discharge the jury, but directed them that the second person had nothing to do with the matter and the reference had been an error. Gleeson CJ, which whom Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J agreed, said (at 14): 
     
      
       
        
        ""The tender of the document with the name [of the other person] on it was an irregularity and the question we must ask ourselves is whether we can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdicts, and that the jury would have returned the same verdicts if the irregularity had not occurred."" 
        
       
      
    22 His Honour considered that the irregularity would not have affected the verdicts, given that the trial judge had given a clear direction and there was no reason to doubt that the jury would have taken the direction at face value. His Honour considered it important that there was nothing else of any kind before the jury that would have given them any indication of who the other person might have been. 
     
      
    23 The test stated in Marsland was adopted by this Court in R v K (2003) 59 NSWLR 431; [2003] NSWCCA 406. In R v K, Wood CJ at CL (with whom Grove and Dunford JJ agreed), at [71] considered that it was relevant in the result in Marsland that the irregularity had come to light and was dealt with before verdict and had been the subject of a clear, express direction to the jury, that was considered sufficient to overcome the prejudice. R v K, on the other hand, involved an irregularity that came to light after the jury had given its verdict.  
     
      
    24 That had also been the situation in R v Rudkowsky (NSWCCA, 15 December 1992, unreported). In that case, handbags had been tendered in evidence but it was later discovered that one of the bags contained several sheets of writing bearing what appeared to be the handwriting of the victim. The Crown conceded that the sheets of writing would not have been included in the tender had their presence been known. The material was clearly prejudicial. Gleeson CJ (with whom Cripps JA and McInerney J agreed), in holding that the appeal should be allowed due to the extremely prejudicial potential of the material, said at 6: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant was entitled to be tried and to have his guilt determined according to law. In determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice in a case such as the present it is important to bear in mind that in this context the word ‘justice’ means justice according to the law. It is not for this Court to decide for itself after perusing the evidence whether we agree with the jury's verdict. Nor is it for this Court to decide whether, even if the irregularity had not occurred, it is likely or even probable that the jury would have reached the same conclusion. We are not here to decide whether the jury’s conclusion was correct. We are not here to decide whether or not the appellant received a fair trial and whether or not his conviction was one entered in accordance with the legal rules that govern the trial of a person in a case such as the present. 
         
         
        However, as has been pointed out by counsel for the Crown, the circumstances that there has been shown to have been an irregularity in the trial does not necessarily mean that the conviction must be quashed and there must be a new trial. It is common ground in this appeal that the test to be applied is that which was stated in the case of  
        R v Marsland 
        , that is to say, whether we can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdict and that the jury would have returned the same verdict if the irregularity had not occurred. That, it is accepted on both sides, is the test to determine whether in the events that have happened in a case like the present, there has been a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    25 As I have indicated, there was no dispute as to the correct principles to be applied. The Crown submitted that the application of the principles gave rise to a number of considerations, namely: the nature of the irregularity; the relevance of the irregularity to the issues before the jury; whether the material was prejudicial; and the extent of the prejudice. Given those considerations, the question was what was called for in the proper exercise of the discretion; namely, a discharge of the jury, or appropriate directions to the jury. That last matter in turn raised the question whether the directions given were adequate. 
     
      
    26 The Crown accepted that the syringe should not have been before the jury. It bore no relevance to the issues in the case and there was no evidence to suggest that the appellant was a drug user, or otherwise had any involvement with drugs. The Crown also accepted that the presence of a syringe or its possession by the appellant, was not capable of lending any support for the prosecution case. In particular, it was not part of the prosecution case that the appellant was motivated to commit the robberies by drug addiction or any other association with drugs. 
     
      
    27 The appellant submitted, however, that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial.  
     
      
    28 Although there was no evidence that the appellant was associated with drugs and the Crown did not advance any motive for the robberies, there was evidence that the appellant had dealt with or had in his possession some of the items taken in the robberies. In particular, there was evidence about pawning a Longines watch on two occasions, about ‘John’ having an urgent need for money, of himself needing money and of suggestions of John’s drug addiction. John, of course, is the co-offender Yin. It is likely that it was these “threads” of evidence, to which if the finding of the syringe was added, gave rise to the appellant’s solicitor’s concern that the syringe more directly linked the appellant with Yin who, to the jury’s knowledge, had pleaded guilty. It is necessary to refer to that evidence in more detail, so as to be able to better gauge whether a direction, and in particular, the direction given by the trial judge, could adequately deal with any prejudice.  
     
      
    29 During the course of the ERISP between the appellant and Detective Senior Constable Davey on 25 October 2002, the appellant was asked questions about the Longines watch. He was informed by Detective Senior Constable Davey that the watch was stolen from Mr Dong and was pawned at the Fairfield Loan Office nine days after the robbery. He was asked whether he knew anything about the watch, but gave no audible reply. He said, however, that he had pawned things at the Fairfield Loan Office, but gave no audible reply as to whether he had pawned the watch. He did say that he had bought quite a few things from the person whom he called John. He said he thought he had bought a men’s Longines watch from John, but he had “hocked” it. He said he had also bought a ladies Longines watch, but he had that at home. The appellant conceded, eventually, that he remembered pawning the men’s Longines watch. He said he bought it for ""a hundred bucks or fifty dollars"". He said that he didn't have the money to pay for the watch on him and that ""[John] needed money so I bought him, I hocked it and gave him the money"". He said that he thought the watch was worth ""a few hundred dollars, five, six hundred"".  
     
      
    30 In the course of the robbery the subject of Count 1, Mr Dong, the receptionist at the premises gave evidence that a Longines watch was stolen from him. In his evidence, the appellant said that he had purchased the watch from a person by the name of John. The appellant said he knew John from work, when he had been looking for work at the appellant's brother's company. He said he did not know this person by any name other than John and that he had worked with him over a two and a half to three month period. In cross-examination, the appellant identified Yin from a photograph as being the person he knew as John.  
     
      
    31 The appellant said that he had worked with his brother ""four, five days a week"" from June until July and after that worked two or three days a week until somewhere in mid-August. He said that after having stopped working sometime around 14 or 15 August for his brother, he assisted a neighbour for a couple of days. He said, however, he was not really working, just giving him a bit of instruction as to cutting the gyprock board as he was ""a bit sick at the time"".  
     
      
    32 The appellant was cross-examined about his purchase of the Longines watch and the subsequent ""hocking"" of it to the Fairfield Loan Office. He gave a version consistent with his answer in the ERISP. He added, however, that John had needed money urgently when he came around and that John had driven him to the Fairfield Loan Office and that he, the appellant, had gone in alone and, having hocked the watch, gave the money to John. He was asked why he didn't suggest to John that he go to the loan shop himself. The appellant responded, ""I don't know. He asked me for help so I thought I was just doing a favour for him, that's all"". He said he was not aware of any reason why John couldn't have gone up and hocked the watch himself. He also said that John often borrowed money from him, ""twenty dollars here, fifty dollars there"". He said that at the time he bought the watch from John, he had heard something about John using drugs, but he wasn't ""100 per cent sure"". He agreed, however, that at the time he bought the watch, a situation had developed on the building site where John worked, of things going missing. He said that notwithstanding that, he was not concerned about taking a watch from ""a person like that"" and hocking it for him. The appellant said that he didn't think about it at the time, because he took his word for it that the watch was his and that the ladies watch was his girlfriend's. He had not, however, seen him wearing a watch.  
     
      
    33 The evidence established that the appellant had redeemed the watch, but pawned it on a second occasion. He was asked in re-examination what he wanted to do with the watch after he had pawned it on each occasion. He said that he was going to keep it at the time because John had told him that it was his watch. However, the appellant paid the interest to redeem the watch from the pawnbroker and his reason for pawning it the second time was because he ""needed the money on that day"". He said that he left it there on the second occasion although he had intended to go back and get it later on.  
     
      
    34 The appellant also gave evidence about being sick and therefore not working during the period of mid-August to early September. His evidence was that he was at home during this time. There was evidence about the use of the appellant’s mobile telephone number during this period which revealed that there were no calls made from his mobile phone during an approximate two-hour period between 2.25pm and 4.16pm on 25 August 2002. It was suggested to him that the reason for the suspension of calls during that period was because he was engaging in the robbery of premises at Sans Souci, being the robbery the subject of Count 6. The appellant said that he was at home sick and could not even get out of bed at that time. He said he was being treated by a doctor, called Dr Tan, and ""some kidney specialist"". He also said that John, or a friend of his, could have had his phone on that occasion. 
     
      
    35 There was also substantial evidence about the use of the appellant's mobile phone number to make calls, both to the premises at which robberies occurred shortly before the robberies, except for the robbery at Five Dock (Count 1), as well as to Yin. The appellant denied that he was responsible for the frequent telephone calls to Yin, saying that he rarely rang him.  
     
      
    36 I have already referred to the principles that apply when an irregularity has occurred in the course of a jury’s deliberation. An examination of the authorities in which an appeal has been brought to quash a guilty verdict in circumstances where there has been an irregularity in the jury's deliberations, indicate that there are a variety of appropriate responses, depending upon the nature of the irregularity, its relevance to the issues in the trial and the circumstances in which the irregularity arose.  
     
      
    37 Thus, in R v Olivier (NSWCCA, 15 September 1993, unreported), the Court was concerned with a case where the trial judge had refused to discharge the jury following the discovery that the jurors were in possession of non-evidentiary material. In that case, the appellants were co-accused in respect of charges of assault with intent to rob and malicious wounding. The non-evidentiary material comprised maps that had markings on them indicating various landmarks that had been referred to throughout the case. The maps appeared to have come from the pages of a street directory. There were six photocopies of the same pages of the street directory, causing the observation to be made that that number of copies would suggest one set for every two jurors. The markings were in different hands.  
     
      
    38 When this matter was brought to the attention of the trial judge, his Honour raised it with the Crown and defence counsel. Defence counsel requested the judge to question the jury as to how they came to be in possession of the material and what use had been made of it. The trial judge refused that application. Defence counsel then specifically indicated that he did not propose to make an application for a discharge, nor did the Crown make any application for a discharge.  
     
      
    39 The trial judge then brought the jury back and gave them further directions. In those directions, the trial judge observed that had the jury requested to be provided with material showing the various places that had been referred to in evidence, he would have suggested to counsel that such material might have been helpful and ought to be provided. He indicated, however, that as that had not been done, he would retain the maps to which they had had access and he directed them that they must entirely disregard those items and confine their deliberations to the evidence which had been placed before them. 
     
      
    40 On appeal, the accused were represented by different counsel. It was submitted that the direction to the jury to disregard the maps was insufficient and that the trial judge had erred in not questioning the jury as to the use that had been made of the maps and, in particular, as to whether any of the jurors had used the maps for the purposes of having a view of the relevant locality. It was submitted that his Honour's refusal to make enquiry of the jury provided a basis for “serious disquiet” as to the jury's verdict. Finlay J, with whom Handley and Sheller JJA agreed, stated at [43] that the test to be applied where there was an irregularity was whether: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… this Court can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdict and the jury would have returned the same verdict if the irregularity had not occurred."" 
        
       
      
    41 Finlay J referred to the statement of Gleeson CJ in Rudkowsky referred to above. His Honour considered, however, that the case was not like Rudkowsky, where the jury had before it inadmissible and highly prejudicial written material which was of such a nature that the irregularity was held to have denied the appellant a fair trial. In Olivier, by contrast, his Honour categorised the material before the jury as being ""benign"" and observed that it had been dealt with promptly by appropriate directions. In that circumstance, his Honour held that no error had been disclosed in the trial judge's exercise of discretion in declining to interrogate the jury. 
     
      
    42 The question in Olivier did not relate to the discharge of a jury. R v Lansdell (NSWCCA, 22 May 1995, unreported) however, provides a closer factual comparison to the circumstances in this case. There, the appellant had been charged with offences of using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension and attempting to induce a person to be called as a witness to give false evidence. The facts relating to the first charge were that, during the course of a high-speed police chase, the appellant produced a shotgun from the window of the car of which he was the driver. There was conflicting evidence as to where the gun was located immediately after the chase. The appellant's wife gave evidence that the gun was usually contained in a striped bag and there was evidence that such a bag was located by the police on the front seat of the appellant's vehicle. There was also evidence that during the course of the police chase, there had been a collision and glass had shattered into the front of the appellant's car.  
     
      
    43 It was the appellant's case, given in an unsworn statement, that the gun was in the boot of the vehicle, so that he could not have produced it during the course of the police chase as the Crown case alleged. He made no mention of the striped bag in his unsworn statement.  
     
      
    44 On the eighth day of a twelve day trial, the trial judge and counsel became aware, as a result of a question from the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the [striped] bag is evidence, is contents of the bag evidence?” 
        
       
       
      that there were three fragments of glass in the striped bag. The trial judge gave a direction to the jury that the fragments were not part of the evidence, that there was no evidence how they came to be in the bag and that the jury should not speculate on that matter. In  
      Lansdell 
      , there was no application to discharge the jury. The issue, for the Court of Criminal Appeal, was whether the direction given by the trial judge in the terms I have indicated was adequate. 
       
      
    45 Gleeson CJ, with whom Finlay J agreed, observed that “the evaluation of the potential seriousness of the irregularity, absent the direction given by the trial judge, is not entirely easy"". The glass had been found in the bag prior to the completion of the evidence. By the end of the trial, there were at least four different versions of the location of the gun and the bag and, by the end of the trial, the question whether the bag was in the front seat of the car was not of particular significance. What was important, on the defence case, was that the gun had been concealed in the boot. It was not the defence case that the gun was in the striped bag. 
     
      
    46 It had not been suggested during the trial that the glass in the bag had come from a broken window in the car or could be used to support an inference as to the location of the bag at any material time. There was no evidence as to how or when the fragments of glass got into the bag, nor was there any attempt to connect them with any of the glass in the car. 
     
      
    47 Gleeson CJ considered that there was a danger that, without any direction from the trial judge, the jury, or individual members of the jury, might engage in a speculative process of reasoning leading to a conclusion that not only was the bag on the front seat of the car, but the gun was also on the front seat and not in the boot. The significance of the danger of there being such a speculative line of reasoning was arguably even more pronounced because, at the time that the glass was found in the bag, the appellant had not given his unsworn statement which formed the basis, on the appellant’s case, for the irrelevance of the location of the bag and the focus upon the location of the gun. 
     
      
    48 Gleeson CJ observed that the trial judge’s direction was framed specifically in response to the question asked by the jury. His Honour considered that that was appropriate because it would have been dangerous to embark upon an explanation of the evidentiary significance, or lack thereof of the glass, given that at that stage the evidence was incomplete and it was not known what the defence case would be. His Honour agreed with the observation of Simpson J as to the test to be applied when an irregularity occurs. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… an irregularity having occurred, the question for this Court is whether we are satisfied that it did not affect the verdicts, and that the jury would have returned the same verdicts if the irregularity had not occurred.”  
        
       
       
      The Chief Justice added: 
       
       
        
        “That question is to be answered in the light of the direction which the trial judge gave when the irregularity came to his attention.” 
        
       
      
    49 His Honour observed that criminal trials and appeals are conducted upon “certain assumptions”, one of which was that juries both understand and follow directions given by trial judges. He observed that it frequently happens that inadmissible material is placed before the jury and, sometimes, such material has potential to cause considerable prejudice to an accused. Ordinarily, in that circumstance, the problem is addressed by the giving of an appropriate direction. His Honour recognised, consistently with the test that he said applied, that there were occasions when a trial judge or an appellate court might conclude that no direction could adequately protect an accused person, and that the only proper course was to discharge a jury. The Chief Justice was of the view that this case did not fall into that category and found that the direction given by the trial judge was adequate in all the circumstances. As I have said, Finlay J agreed. However, Simpson J held that the direction was not adequate.  
     
      
    50 In my opinion, the direction given by his Honour was appropriate and sufficient. His Honour, in clear language, directed the jury that the syringe was not evidence in the case and its presence was to be ignored. He cautioned them that it had never been part of the Crown case that the appellant was in any way connected with drugs and that any such thought must be put out of their minds. They were directed not to speculate as to how the syringe came to be in the jacket. His Honour indicated that there were other possible explanations for the use of a syringe, including legitimate self-medication, but that there was no evidence that it had been used by the appellant for that reason, or that he even knew that the syringe was in his jacket. His Honour indicated that there could have been a variety of reasons why the syringe came to be in the jacket, including having been placed there by mistake after it was seized by the police. His Honour reiterated the importance of not speculating and that this syringe had nothing to do with the case.  
     
      
    51 Although there was evidence that the co-accused was possibly a drug user, it was not part of the Crown case that the appellant was a drug user or had a motive related to drugs for the commission of the crimes. In those circumstances, I consider that the direction given by his Honour was adequate. The authorities are clear that it is a matter for the discretion of the trial judge as to what course to take when an irregularity has occurred. The authorities are also clear that appropriate directions may, in certain circumstances, be sufficient. Given the directions to the jury in this case, I am of the opinion that his Honour did not err in dealing with the matter in that way. I am satisfied that the presence of the syringe did not affect the verdicts, and that the jury would have returned the same verdicts if the irregularity had not occurred. The jury gave due consideration to their task. This is apparent, amongst other things, from the fact that the jury brought the syringe to the court’s attention.  
     
      
    52 There was significant identification evidence before the jury. That included photographic evidence identifying the appellant, as well as descriptions of what the appellant was wearing, which included the jacket. That jacket was of a very particular style, described in the evidence as a “Mao” jacket which was grey in colour. It was readily identified by the witnesses. There was also a significant body of coincidence evidence, including numerous telephone calls from the mobile phone that was found on the appellant at the time of his arrest, to the premises that were robbed in the days immediately preceding the robbery. That occurred in respect of all premises other than for the robbery at Five Dock (Count 1 on the indictment). There was also evidence of many telephone calls from the appellant’s mobile to Yin. The appellant himself gave evidence of an association with Yin including some knowledge of a suggested drug habit. There was also evidence of pawning expensive goods cheaply, allegedly because Yin wanted a small amount of money.  
     
      
    53 In short, the direct identification evidence, taken in conjunction with the coincidence evidence made this a strong Crown case. There was no evidence or suggestion that the appellant was a drug user or had a motive for the crime. Juries are given directions on the basis that those directions will be followed. To the extent the syringe may have had the potential for prejudice, I am satisfied that such potential was overcome by the trial judge’s directions.  
     
      
    54 For the reasons that I have indicated, I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    55 The appellant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 12 years 3 months with a non-parole period of ten years. The individual sentences imposed by his Honour are conveniently set out in the following table:

           1

           4.5 years 
           
         
         
          
           
           2 & 5 
           
          
           
           7 years 
           
          
           
           5.25 years 
           
         
         
          
           
           6-8 
           
          
           
           8 years 
           
          
           
           6 years 
           
         
         
          
           
           9 & 10 
           
          
           
           9 years 
           
          
           
           6.75 years 
           
         
        
       
      
    56 The appellant contends that his Honour erred in the sentencing process on the following grounds: first, in failing to apply the provisions of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) correctly; secondly, in failing to impose individual sentences in respect of each offence; and thirdly, in that the sentences were manifestly excessive having regard to principles of totality, parity and the “general tariff” for sentences of this type. The appellant further contends that his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances.  
     
      
       
      Incorrect application of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       
      
    57 Section 44, as it applied in respect of these offences provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, a court is required: 
         
         
         (a) firstly, to set the term of the sentence, and 
         
         
          
          (b) secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    58 The alleged error was said to flow from his Honour’s comment in his Remarks on Sentence that he had come to the view “that the minimum term to be served is ten years, with the head sentence effectively being 13 years and 3 months”.  
     
      
    59 It was suggested that this comment indicated that his Honour had in mind the provisions of s 44 as they were as at the date of sentence, which provided that when sentencing an offender, the Court is first required to set a non-parole period, and then to set the balance of the term. The terms of s 44 which applied at the date of these offences and which thus applied to the sentences to be imposed provided that the Court was first to set the term of the sentence and then to set the non-parole period. 
     
      
    60 In my opinion, this ground has not been made out. Section 44 relates to the sentence that is imposed for each offence. When imposing the sentence in respect of each offence, his Honour correctly applied s 44. His Honour’s comment about which complaint is made related to the total effective sentence and minimum term he had considered should be imposed. That has nothing to do with the proper application of s 44. I should add that although senior counsel did not abandon this ground, it was not otherwise argued on the hearing of this appeal.  
     
      
       
      Failure to impose individual sentences in respect of each offence 
       
      
    61 In imposing the sentences in respect of the eight Counts, his Honour first dealt with Count 1, imposing a sentence of six years and a non-parole period of four and a half years. His Honour then “grouped” the remaining Counts in the following way. First, in respect of Counts 2 and 5, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of  
        each  
        of the second and fifth Counts in the indictment you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment for seven years to date from 25 October 2002 and to expire on 24 October 2009. I set a non-parole period of five years and three months to date from the commencement of the sentence and to expire on 24 January 2008. I do not find special circumstances. You are eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of a non-parole period.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    62 He then dealt with Counts 6, 7 and 8: 
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of Counts 6, 7 and 8, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment for eight years to date from 25 October 2004 and to expire on 24 October 2012. I set a non-parole period of six years to date from the commencement of the sentence and to expire on 24 October 2010. I do not find special circumstances. You are eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    63 His Honour then dealt with Counts 9 and 10: 
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of Counts 9 and 10, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment for nine years to date from 25 January 2006 and to expire on 24 January 2015. I set a non-parole period of six years and nine months to date from the commencement of the sentence and to expire on 24 October 2012. I do not find special circumstances. You are eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    64 The appellant submitted that his Honour (other than in respect of Count 1) did not differentiate between the offences in each grouping. It was submitted that in those circumstances, his Honour failed to impose an individual sentence in respect of each offence as required by s 44. The appellant submitted that by failing to set out the sentences one after the other and impose sentences separately in respect of each offence, it was not possible to properly examine the sentence that had been imposed in respect of each individual offence. It was submitted that this undermined the recent trend towards transparency in sentencing: see Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048; [2005] HCA 25 at [39].  
     
      
    65 The Crown submitted that his Honour’s approach is an accepted practice in sentencing for multiple offences and is adopted to avoid the sentencing process becoming too cumbersome and also to be able to better deal with the principle of totality.  
     
      
    66 There may be circumstances in which such an approach is appropriate. However, I do not consider that it is appropriate in a case such as the present where the number of offences is not so numerous that to deal with them individually would be cumbersome. Indeed, in a case such as the present, involving eight offences, six of which were committed on separate occasions, there is a danger in failing to deal with each offence separately in that the criminality involved in the individual offences may be overlooked or become lost in the attempt to assess the totality of the seriousness of the offences.  
     
      
    67 As was pointed out in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57 “totality” is considered after the individual sentences are imposed. In Pearce, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said (at [45]): 
     
      
       
        
        “A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.” 
        
       
       
      Their Honours had observed earlier in the same paragraph: 
       
       
        
        “To an offender, the only relevant question may be ‘how long’, and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error.” 
        
       
      
    68 Pearce, however, does not prescribe a mandatory approach. In Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616; [2004] HCA 15 Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ said at [26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the joint judgment in  
        Pearce 
         recognises the currency of [ 
        Mill v The Queen  
        (1988) 166 CLR 59; [1988] HCA 70] by referring to the principle of totality which it reiterates. The joint judgment in  
        Mill 
         expresses a preference for what should be regarded as the orthodox, but not necessarily immutable, practice of fixing a sentence for each offence and aggregating them before taking the next step of determining concurrency.  
        Pearce 
         does not decree that a sentencing judge may never lower each sentence and then aggregate them for determining the time to be served. To do that, is not to do what the joint judgment in  
        Pearce 
         holds to be undesirable, that is, to have regard  
        only 
         to the total effective sentence to be imposed on an offender. The preferable course will usually be the one which both cases commend but neither absolutely commands. Judges of first instance should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected.” (Original emphasis) (Footnote omitted) 
        
       
      
    69 Nonetheless, I consider that this was a case to which the approach in Pearce was particularly apt and that the danger adverted to in the joint judgment was real.  
     
      
    70 The Crown submitted, however, that it was apparent from the Remarks on Sentence that there was no error as alleged. The Crown pointed out that in the Remarks on Sentence, his Honour sentenced the appellant “in respect of each” of Counts 2 and 5 (emphasis added). However, his Honour did not repeat that terminology in respect of Counts 6, 7 or 8, or in respect of Counts 9 and 10. The Crown submitted that the omission of the word “each” in respect of the second and third grouping of offences was a simple omission and that the word “each” should be implied before the other counts and that there was no failure to sentence in respect of each offence. The Crown submitted that a correct reading of his Honour’s remarks was that his Honour intended to make the sentences in each group concurrent with each other and for there to be partial accumulation as between each group of offences.  
     
      
    71 There is sense in the submission that the absence of the word “each” in respect of the second and third groups was a mere omission as it would be curious for the trial judge to decide to group sentences and then treat groupings in a different way when there was no apparent reason to do so.  
     
      
    72 There was one aspect of his Honour’s sentencing remarks, however, that might indicate that his Honour may have failed to sentence individually within each group, namely, the manner in which his Honour grouped the sentences.  
     
      
    73 The first grouping was in respect of Counts 2 and 5. Those two Counts could logically be referred to together, as they involved the same incident (and his Honour said he sentenced in respect of each of them). However, the grouping of Count 6 with Counts 7 and 8 is not so logical. Counts 7 and 8 could logically be referred to together, as those charges related to the robbery at premises at Matraville, the separate charges relating to the robbery from two different persons present at the premises at the time. However, Count 6 was a charge relating to a robbery at Sans Souci a day before the robbery at Matraville. Likewise, Counts 9 and 10 were not connected. The robberies subject of these offences were on different occasions and at different locations. 
     
      
    74 On the other hand, his Honour acknowledged the requirement to sentence individually in accordance with Pearce and an appellate Court should not lightly ignore a clear statement by a trial judge as to the process he followed. On balance, I have concluded that his Honour sentenced the appellant in respect of each offence. 
     
      
    75 This part of his Honour’s sentencing remarks does, however, raise a different matter for consideration. After referring to the need to sentence in respect of each offence, his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I also need to allocate increased penalties in respect of those offences occurring later in time as the offences were committed and rather than adopt a global approach to sentencing which would be in error as discussed in the Court of Criminal Appeal decisions in  
        Gorman 
         [2002] NSWCCA 516 and  
        Swadling 
         [2004] NSWCCA 421. Accordingly the sentences I am about to impose will as to some of them have differing terms of imprisonment and differing terms of non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    76 Gorman was a very different case from the present. It was concerned, principally, with the correct application of Pearce, where a number of offences (in that case sexual offences), were committed on the same victim during a single but extended period of time. In Swadling, Smart AJ, with whom Hodgson JA agreed, reviewed the principles that were to be applied when sentencing for multiple offences. His Honour pointed out that in that case, the trial judge (who, incidentally, was Dodd DCJ, who appears to have been conscious of the matters raised by the Court in Swadling), had not undertaken an analysis of the individual offences, but had appeared to adopt a global approach contrary to Pearce and Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59; [1988] HCA 70. In re-sentencing, Smart AJ, when considering the numerous counts as they occurred later in the sequence of offending, referred to the criminality of the offender as “mounting” and applied successive increases of six months imprisonment above that imposed on the previous sentence. 
     
      
    77 In R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152; [2000] NSWCCA 292 Wood CJ at CL (Beazley JA and Greg James J agreeing) considered at [37] that  
     
      
       
        
        “[h]aving regard to the individual seriousness of the offences charged in these counts, the accelerating outbreak of unlawfulness on the part of the respondent, and the inconsistencies in sentence identified [the trial judge had undervalued] the degree of criminality displayed …” 
        
       
       
      and imposed sentences that were appellably lenient. In re-sentencing, his Honour explained the imposition of an enlarged sentence imposed in respect of the last of the seven counts of which the respondent had been convicted as being to mark, amongst other considerations,  
      “the accelerating, and ultimately the total criminality”. 
       
      
    78 Dodd DCJ appears to have considered that he was required to allocate increased penalties in respect of those offences occurring later in time. I do not consider there is any such principle, although there may be circumstances where such an approach is warranted, provided that in doing so the principles stated in Pearce are not overlooked. 
     
      
    79 Here his Honour imposed an escalating scale in respect of the sentences on a basis that appears only to have had regard to the dates upon which the sentences were committed rather than to the seriousness of the individual offences. This resulted in a significant disparity between the first sentence imposed of six years and the last of nine years when there were very little differences in the offences. That disparity has resulted in sentences which, in circumstances where the offences were of similar objective seriousness, cannot be reconciled merely by reference to accelerating criminality and indicates error. The error could be characterised as a failure to correctly apply Pearce or alternatively that the escalating sentences imposed resulted in the overall effective sentence being manifestly excessive. 80 Before determining what, if anything, should flow from the error, I will deal with the other issues still to be determined. I should also comment at this stage that the appellant did not complain about error arising from the escalating scale of sentences imposed. I will deal with this later.  
     
      
       
      Were the sentences manifestly excessive? 
       
      
    81 The appellant submitted that the effective term of imprisonment and the non-parole period in this case were manifestly excessive in that the sentencing judge had failed to take proper account of the principle of totality, had failed to give proper effect to the principle of parity in relation to the sentences imposed on the co-offender, Yin, and that the total effective head sentence and the non-parole period were manifestly excessive, when regard was had to sentences usually imposed in respect of multiple armed robberies. Each of these arguments needs to be dealt with separately. In dealing with the question of manifestly excessive sentences, it needs to be kept in mind that the maximum penalty is 20 years and the appellant was convicted on 8 counts. It is convenient to first deal with the question of parity. 
     
      
       
      Parity 
       
      
    82 The appellant’s co-offender, Yin, was sentenced by her Honour Judge Tupman on 10 December 2003 in respect of seven substantive offences, with five matters being taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Her Honour observed that the totality of the charges with which she was dealing was six armed robbery charges, five aggravated armed robbery charges and one charge of aggravated assault with intent to rob. 
     
      
    83 The seven substantive charges involved three charges of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act and four charges of aggravated armed robbery contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act. The first three offences dealt with by Judge Tupman corresponded to the offences in Counts 1, 2 and 5 on the appellant’s indictment. The fifth and sixth charges against Yin were Counts 10 and 9 respectively charged against the appellant. However, the fifth and sixth charges against Yin were laid under s 97(2) which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The appellant was charged under s 97(1) in respect of those offences. As I have already said, an offence under s 97(1) carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    84 Further, one of the offences with which the appellant was charged namely Count 7, was taken into account on a Form 1 in Yin’s case. Yin also had two matters on a Form 1 corresponding to Counts 3 and 4 on the appellant’s indictment in respect of which there were verdicts by direction. The remaining matters on the other Form 1 in the appellant’s case were charges that related to the robbery from individuals at the massage parlours, where the robbery of the massage parlour itself constituted the principal charge.  
     
      
    85 It is not apparent from the Remarks on Sentence by Judge Tupman, nor from the transcript of the appellant’s trial nor the Remarks on Sentence of Judge Dodd, why the appellant and Yin were not charged in the same way for the same offences. 
     
      
    86 In respect of the charges that were common to the appellant and Yin, there was no difference in the objective criminality of their individual offending. The trial judge considered that their respective roles were equal. He later said that the appellant’s “overall criminality is somewhat less that that of Yin”. Presumably his Honour was referring in his Remarks on Sentence to the additional offences in respect of which Yin was being sentenced.  
     
      
    87 The subjective circumstances of the appellant and Yin were somewhat similar. Both were in their twenties: the appellant was born on 17 June 1974 and was thus 28 at the time of the offences. Yin was aged 26 at the time of sentence. Both were born in China. The appellant came to Australia in 1985 when he was 10 or 11. It is not apparent from Judge Tupman’s Remarks on Sentence when Yin came to Australia, although it appears that it was when he was a child. Both have a history of drug abuse. In Yin’s case, Judge Tupman found that the commission of the crimes was motivated by his addiction to heroin. However, Judge Dodd rejected that was a motive in the case of the appellant. Whilst it could be surmised that that was a motive, having regard to the appellant’s drug addiction, no evidentiary basis was established to interfere with that finding. In this regard, it should be borne in mind that the appellant, on sentence, continued to maintain his innocence.  
     
      
    88 Both had criminal histories. The appellant had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment in 1993 on five counts of robbery whilst being armed, in respect of which he was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 18 months. His Honour Judge Dodd stated that in that circumstance, the appellant had committed the present offences knowing that he was exposed to a significant penalty. Given the convictions for armed robbery, his Honour was not prepared to extend leniency to the appellant in respect of the present charges. Yin also had a criminal history dating back to 1996, and which involved serving sentences of imprisonment. Her Honour Judge Tupman did not consider Yin had good prospects of rehabilitation, mainly due to his drug dependency. Her Honour found that he was remorseful and contrite.  
     
      
    89 Judge Tupman allowed Yin a 25 per cent discount for the pleas of guilty. Were it not for the discount, the effective total sentence that would have been imposed on Yin was 14 years. That was reduced to 11 years for the pleas. The effective total non-parole period was 8 years 3 months. Her Honour found special circumstance, as she had partially accumulated the sentences. 
     
      
    90 Judge Dodd, in considering the question of parity, noted that Yin had pleaded guilty to offences of a more serious nature in some instances, although they were the same offences committed in company with the appellant. His Honour also observed that Yin had been given a discount for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty. He observed that, undoubtedly, Yin’s pleas of guilty were also taken as some indication of remorse or contrition which was absent in the appellant’s case, the appellant, as I have said, continuing to maintain his innocence even upon sentence. His Honour considered that the prospects of rehabilitation were not good. He found that the there was no evidence that the appellant had committed the offences to fund his drug addiction. Indeed, his Honour considered the evidence was “all the other way”.  
     
      
    91 The question of parity in this case is somewhat complicated by the different manner in which the appellant and Yin were charged. Yin was charged, in respect of a number of matters, with the more serious offence of robbery with a dangerous weapon: s 97(2). The offence under s 97(1) is, relevantly, robbery with an offensive weapon. Section 97(2) carries a higher maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment as compared to 20 years under s 97(1). There is the added difficulty that the number of charges is different. Yin was charged with seven offences in respect of which he pleaded guilty, while the appellant was convicted of eight counts. Yin then had a further five matters taken into account on a Form 1. In sentencing Yin in respect of the principal offences to which the Form 1 matters attached, the Court was required to impose a heavier penalty than would otherwise have been the case had he been sentenced only in respect of the principal offence: see Attorney-General's Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146; [2002] NSWCCA 581; R v Timmis [2003] NSWCCA 518. There were also, in the case of Yin, two separate offences under s 97(2) in respect of which the appellant was not involved. However, there was one offence (Count 6 (Sans Souci)) in respect of which Yin was not charged.  
     
      
    92 The following table compares the offences and respective sentences imposed for Qing and his co-offender, Yin. It should be observed that in Yin’s case Tupman DCJ only set a non-parole period in respect of the last count. Where an offence was charged under s 97(2) that has been stated. The reference to the ‘notional sentence’ in the table is a reference to the sentence that would have been imposed but for the plea of guilty.

    93 If comparison is made with the “notional sentence” imposed on Yin it is apparent that the sentences imposed for the common offences were approximately the same. The comparison cannot be precise, for the reasons I have already mentioned, including the use of the Form 1 procedure. Thus, in relation to Counts 7 and 8 (the Marrickville offences), the appellant was sentenced to total sentences of 16 years whereas Yin was sentenced to a “notional” term of eight years in respect of his involvement in those offences, the equivalent matter to Count 7 being dealt with on a Form 1. The effective sentence was the same, however, as his Honour Judge Dodd ordered that Counts 7 and 8 be served concurrently. The one exception where the sentence is not comparable relates to Count 10. This disparity may arise because of his Honour’s “escalation” of the sentences in the manner to which I have already referred, although Tupman DCJ also appears to have escalated the sentences although not to the same extent and the higher sentences imposed in respect of some of the later offences may be explicable because of the necessity to have regard to the Form I offences.  
     
      
    94 The two judges approached accumulation a little differently, but that is a process that principally (although not solely) relates to totality. Were it not for the plea of guilty, Yin would have received a longer effective sentence than the appellant, namely a sentence of 14 years. That indicates that Yin’s sentence was more severe than the sentence imposed on the appellant, although it must be remembered that Yin was charged with an offence that did not involve the appellant, and had offences taken into account on a Form 1, not involving the appellant.  
     
      
    95 The foundation for the concept that there should be parity in sentencing of co-offenders lies in considerations of fairness and whether a legitimate sense of grievance is engendered by a comparison. “Parity” is not simply a technical concept and while comparison of individual sentences is appropriate, so is comparison of the total effective sentence imposed for co-offending. Once that is done, it is apparent that the appellant could not have a legitimate sense of grievance. Accordingly, I would reject the submission that there was not parity as between the sentences imposed on the two co-offenders. 
     
      
       
      Comparable sentences 
       
      
    96 The appellant next contends that if regard is had to comparable sentences imposed for offences under s 97(1), it will be apparent that the sentences imposed on him were manifestly excessive. It was submitted that this was particularly so, given the sentencing judge’s finding that the offences were in the “mid-range of seriousness for such offences”.  
     
      
    97 In R v El-Andouri [2004] NSWCCA 178, the Court (Tobias JA, Kirby and Bell JJ) referred to a number of cases involving sentencing for multiple armed robberies. Those cases disclose a range of sentences from 18 years, with a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months: see R v Merritt [2000] NSWCCA 365, which involved one Count of robbery armed with a sawn-off rifle in circumstances where the victim was wounded, to a number of cases where a head sentence of 12 years was imposed, with non-parole periods of between 6 and 9 years. The analysis undertaken by the Court was not exhaustive, the Court only giving consideration to the total effective sentence imposed. It is also relevant that a number of the cases were Crown appeals. 
     
      
    98 While an understanding of sentences imposed by other courts for the same offence committed by different offenders is necessary to promote consistency in sentencing, care has to be taken not to rely upon a limited sample. Whilst the analysis undertaken in El-Andouri is of some assistance, at the end of the day the Court is required to consider whether the sentences imposed here were manifestly excessive. If so, error is established, requiring the appellant to be re-sentenced. Alternatively, if some other error has been demonstrated, the Court may only re-sentence if some other sentence is warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act: s 6(3). 
     
      
    99 At this point, something should be said about the individual sentences imposed by his Honour. In R v Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; [1999] NSWCCA 111, in a guideline judgment in respect of offences under s 97(1) (being the offence involved here), this Court held at [162] that a sentence of 4 to 5 years was appropriate in circumstance where the following factors were involved: a young offender with no or little criminal history; a weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; a limited degree of planning; limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; a victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; a small amount taken; and a plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.  
     
      
    100 The Court pointed out that the individual circumstances of the commission of the offence and of the offender may mean that a lesser or a greater sentence would be appropriate. 
     
      
    101 This case is more serious than the “common “ circumstances referred to in the guideline judgment in that there was no plea of guilty and the appellant had a prior criminal history with one period of imprisonment of 4 years with a minimum term of 18 months.  
     
      
       
      Totality 
       
      
    102 The appellant submitted that the offending in this case occurred during a short space of time so as to be part of a relatively short crime spree, although he accepted that the various robberies could not be considered as part of one act of criminality. However, he submitted that the effect of the partial accumulation of sentences, with a lapse of 3 years 3 months between the commencement of the first and the last sentences, resulted in a sentence that was excessive. As I understand the appellant’s submission, no complaint was made about the fact of partial accumulation, only its extent. In my opinion, this submission should be accepted.  
     
      
    103 When regard is then had to the sentence imposed here, I am of the view that the sentences imposed by his Honour, in respect of all but Count 1, were manifestly excessive. Likewise, the total effective sentence was manifestly excessive. I have already adverted to this above. The sentence imposed in respect of Count 1 was within a range of sentences that could appropriately be imposed. However, as there were no significant differences in the criminality involved in the various sentences, as I have already discussed, there was no reasonable basis upon which the offence in Count 1 attracted a sentence of 6 years whereas the offences in, for example, Counts 9 and 10, attracted sentences of 9 years. It is almost undoubted that his Honour’s error arose from his understanding that he was required to impose an escalating scale of sentences and did so with a degree of escalation which resulted in the latter sentences being manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    104 The next question is whether a sentence of 7 years for each of Counts 2 and 5 is manifestly excessive. It is between approximately 30 and 40 per cent greater than the basic range referred to in Henry, although this case is more serious because of the appellant’s prior conviction for five counts of robbery being armed. In my opinion, when regard is had to the fact that there was no difference of note in the seriousness of the offences, it would be inconsistent to treat the other offences differently unless to take into account the acceleration in the offending. Given that I consider that it is a borderline as to whether a sentence of 7 years is within an appropriate range, I am of the opinion that internal consistency within the sentencing process is such that some other sentence is warranted in law: see the Criminal Appeal Act s 6(3). This conclusion is subject to my view that some regard has to be had to the appellant’s accelerating criminality, but not to the extent considered by his Honour. I give effect to this view in the sentences that I consider should be imposed on re-sentence. 
     
      
    105 I consider sentences of 8 and 9 years to be outside the available discretionary range. However, I am of the opinion that some regard should be had to the acceleration in the appellant’s offending over the short period involved and that should be reflected in the sentence imposed for the last offence.  
     
      
       
      Special circumstances 
       
      
    106 The trial judge did not find special circumstances. His Honour acknowledged that because of the appellant’s youth and also because of his drug addiction and his attempts to overcome that addiction, it would be open to do so. He considered, however, that given the manner in which he proposed to structure the sentences, it was neither necessary nor desirable to alter the statutory ratio of non-parole period to the head sentence.  
     
      
    107 In the original written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant, it was suggested that his Honour should have accepted that the appellant’s offending was motivated by his drug addiction for that reason and should also have found special circumstances. There was no direct evidence to support that submission and his Honour did not err by finding to the contrary. However, there is no doubt that the appellant had a drug addiction problem at the time of the offence from which it might be inferred that that at least explained his offence and might have been the motivation for it. For myself, I do not consider it necessary to decide that question, and the evidence is that he has taken positive steps to overcome it. His attempts have appeared to have been successful.  
     
      
    108 The appellant also submitted that his Honour should have found special circumstances given that his Honour had imposed cumulative sentences. Reference was made to R v King [1999] NSWCCA 251 at [11] per Wood CJ at CL (Greg James J agreeing); R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58 at [61]; R v Street [2005] NSWCCA 139; R v Hung Lo 159 A Crim R 71; [2005] NSWCCA 436. In R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85, Spigelman CJ at [18] expressed a doubt as to whether the mere fact of accumulation was a special circumstance, but did not decide the point.  
     
      
    109 These cases do not stand for the proposition that the fact that there has been an accumulation of sentences constitutes or may constitute a special circumstance. Rather, the point considered in these cases arose either because the sentencing judge had found special circumstances but had failed to structure the total sentence so as to give effect to that finding or because the structure of the sentences skewed the proportion between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence.  
     
      
    110 Thus, in Hung Lo, which involved sentencing on two counts of supplying heroin, the sentencing judge had found special circumstances and set non-parole periods in respect of the two Counts that were 66.6 per cent of the head sentence. However, the effect of accumulating the sentences resulted in a proportion of the aggregate non-parole period relative to the aggregate head sentence of 82 per cent.  
     
      
    111 A similar problem had arisen in Street. Spigelman CJ also commented upon this issue in Baker, where the Chief Justice said at [18]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It does not appear to me that the mere fact of accumulation is [a special circumstance]. However, the consequence of accumulation on a minimum term may be, as indeed it would have been in this case, to significantly attenuate an additional term for the other offence. It is not necessary to finally decide this point.” 
        
       
      
    112 In Simpson Hunt CJ at CL examined the problem that sometimes arose when cumulative sentences were imposed and concluded (at 61) that he was satisfied that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… special circumstances may also exist in the appropriate case where a court is imposing a series of cumulative sentences, so that it can ensure a proper proportion between the total minimum term and the effective additional term – even if it is only to produce an effective additional term equal to, or roughly equivalent to, one-third of the total minimum term which the prisoner is to serve.” 
        
       
      
    113 In my opinion, his Honour Judge Dodd was not obliged to find special circumstances either because of the appellant’s drug addiction or because of accumulation. It is apparent from his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence that he directed his mind to the question of special circumstances and determined not to make such a finding. It does not appear that any submission was made to his Honour that an accumulation of sentences ought to be considered in relation to special circumstances. But in any event, the disproportion that sometimes occurs when cumulative sentences are imposed did not occur in this case, undoubtedly because the longest sentences were imposed on the last two counts.114 In my opinion, no error has been shown in his Honour’s failure to find special circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Should this Court re-sentence? 
       
      
    115 The appellant accepted that, even if some error had been shown in the sentencing process, an appellate court would not interfere unless some other sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That statutory provision applies to each sentence, not simply the effective total sentence: Pearce at [49]. For the reasons I have given, I consider that some other sentence is warranted in law in respect of all but Count 1. 
     
      
    116 In approaching the task of re-sentencing I adopt the Remarks on Sentence of the trial judge, to the extent that they record the particular circumstances of each crime, the objective criminality of the crimes and the appellant’s personal circumstances. I also have regard to the question of parity, being of the opinion that in this case, parity requires a lesser overall sentence to that which would have been imposed upon Yin but for the pleas of guilty, given Yin’s additional criminality in relation to the offence with which he was charged and in respect of which the appellant was not involved. I agree with and adopt the trial judge's assessment that the appellant and Yin were both equally responsible in the commission of these crimes. 
     
      
    117 In this case, although there are multiple offences, they are not so numerous as to make the approach discussed in Pearce inappropriate. In adopting that approach, I propose to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence and to then consider questions of concurrency and totality. 
     
      
    118 As I have said previously, there was little difference in seriousness between the offences. The value of the money and goods stolen varied slightly, but the amount and/or value of the goods stolen was not large, the largest sum stolen being about $1,600. To the extent there was a difference, it was the weapon used. In the earlier offences the weapon used by the appellant was a knife, whereas in the later offences it was a pistol or replica pistol. In this regard, the trial judge did not make a finding as to whether the gun was a replica or not. It was not submitted by either the appellant or the Crown that the use of one or other weapon should impact on the seriousness of the offence. There are cases where this might be so. In this case, however, in the absence of any distinction being drawn in respect of the weapon used, I consider that an approach that the sentences should reflect that the offences were of approximately equal seriousness should have been be applied, subject to regard being had to the appellant’s “accelerating criminality”: see Bavadra discussed above. 
     
      
    119 Although I have held that Judge Dodd was not in error in declining to find special circumstances, I am of the opinion that because of the partial accumulation of sentences and the fact that the appellant has shown that he has been taking steps to overcome his drug addiction so that his prospects of rehabilitation are better than considered by the trial judge, it is appropriate to make such a finding. 
     
      
    120 I propose that fixed terms of imprisonment be set for all counts save for Count 10. When regard is had to totality, I am of the opinion that the appellant should be sentenced to a total effective term of 10 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months. I propose that the sentences be partially accumulated by 6 months. I propose a non-parole period of 4 years in respect of Count 10 to take account of my view that when regard is had to the totality of the sentences imposed and when special circumstances are taken into account, the appellant should be sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 10 years 6 months and a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months. 
     
      
    121 Accordingly, I would propose the following: 
     
      
       
      1. Extend the time in which to file a Notice of Appeal against conviction and Notice of Leave to Appeal against sentence to 20 March 2006; 
       
       
      2. Dismiss the appeal against conviction; 
       
       
      3. Grant leave to appeal against sentence; 
       
       
      4. Allow the appeal against sentence in part; 
       
       
      5. Confirm the sentence imposed upon the appellant in respect of Count 1. Otherwise quash the sentences and re-sentence as follows (for convenience I will also set out the sentence in respect of Count 1): 
       
       
      Confirm the sentence in respect of Count 1 as follows:  
      The appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 6 years to commence on 25 October 2002 and to expire on 24 October 2008 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to commence on 25 October 2002 and to expire on 24 April 2007. 
       
       
      Re-sentence in respect of Count 2 as follows:  
      The appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 6 years to commence on 25 April 2003 and to expire on 24 April 2009 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to commence on 25 April 2003 and to expire on 24 October 2007. 
       
       
      Re-sentence in respect of Count 5 as follows:  
      The appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 6 years to commence on 25 October 2003 and to expire on 24 October 2009 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to commence on 25 October 2003 and to expire on 24 April 2008. 
       
       
      Re-sentence in respect of Count 6 as follows:  
      The appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 6 years to commence on 25 April 2004 and to expire on 24 April 2010 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to commence on 25 April 2004 and to expire on 24 October 2008. 
       
       
      Re-sentence in respect of Count 7 as follows:  
      The appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 6 years to commence on 25 October 2004 and to expire on 24 October 2010 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to commence on 25 October 2004 and to expire on 24 April 2009. 
       
       
      Re-sentence in respect of Count 8 as follows:  
      The appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 6 years to commence on 25 April 2005 and to expire on 24 April 2011 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to commence on 25 April 2005 and to expire on 24 October 2009. 
       
       
      Re-sentence in respect of Count 9 as follows:  
      The appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 6 years to commence on 25 October 2005 and to expire on 24 October 2011 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to commence on 25 October 2005 and to expire on 24 April 2010. 
       
       
      Re-sentence in respect of Count 10 as follows:  
      The appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 7 years to commence on 25 April 2006 and to expire on 24 April 2013 with a non-parole period of 4 years to commence on 25 April 2006 and to expire on 24 April 2010. 
       
      
    122 HULME J: I have had the advantage of perusing the judgment of Beazley JA which contains a summary of much of the evidence given during the course of the Appellant’s trial. So far as possible I shall avoid repetition. 
     
      
    123 Like her Honour, I would extend the time for appeal but dismiss the Appellant’s appeal against his conviction. However, I am unable to agree that the syringe found by the jury in the Appellant’s coat would not have had much prejudicial value. In my view that prejudicial value was likely to be very high. 
     
      
    124 Furthermore, although when the existence of the syringe was bought to the trial Judge’s attention, His Honour directed the jury in terms about which no legitimate complaint can be made and I am a firm believer in the proposition that juries can and do decide cases upon the basis of instructions given to them, it has been recognised that there are exceptions to that general situation. As Simpson J said in R v Lansdell (Unreported, CCA 22 May 1995) 
     
      
       
        
        “The system necessarily places a great deal of faith in the ability of a jury to accept, and follow, the directions of a trial judge, even in circumstances where it might appear to the jury that they are asked to act against the dictates of common sense. Equally, however, the system recognises that there are bounds beyond which a jury cannot be expected, or asked, to go. For this reason, the criminal appeal courts have developed the notion encapsulated in the commonly used phrase ""no direction to the jury could have cured the damage … ."" Implicit in this notion is the recognition that there are occasions when the legal system accepts that a jury will not, or cannot be expected to, comply with the directions of a trial judge.  
        
       
      
    125 Gleeson CJ, in whose judgment Finlay J concurred, made observations to like effect. See also R v K (2003) 59 NSWLR 431 at [78]. 
     
      
    126 The circumstances here fell within that exceptional category. In my view, no directions were capable of overcoming the prejudice which arose from the presence of the syringe in this case. 
     
      
    127 I acknowledge that it was physically possible for the offender John Yin (sometimes referred to as “John Ying”), about whom there was evidence that he was or may have been a drug addict and with whom the evidence showed the Appellant had some significant connection, to have placed the syringe in the Appellant’s coat either at a time the coat was borrowed or otherwise. I acknowledge also that there were other possible explanations for the presence of the syringe. However, so strongly does the presence of a syringe in a coat pocket indicate the likelihood that the owner of the coat is a drug addict that I do not believe that the jury could have put the topic out of their mind. Particularly is this so given the evidence as to John Yin’s addiction, that John Yin was a friend or associate of the Appellant and that the Appellant had limited employment and had been sufficiently short of money at one stage to be pawning a watch. 
     
      
    128 In my view once the syringe was found by the jury, the only proper course for Judge Dodd to take was to acquiesce in the application that the jury be discharged without verdict. 
     
      
    129 However, even if error is found, the proviso to Section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act enables this court to dismiss an appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. I am persuaded that that is the situation and the court should exercise its power under that proviso. In my view the evidence against the Appellant on the charges of which he was convicted was so compelling that conviction was inevitable. 
     
      
    130 The charges upon which the Appellant was convicted arose from the robbery of persons who happened to be present at the relevant times at six brothels -  
     
      
       
        
        On 16 August 2002 at Five Dock 
         
         
        On 23 August 2002 at Narwee 
         
         
        On 25 August 2002 at Sans Souci 
         
         
        On 26 August 2002 at Matraville 
         
         
        On 29 August 2002 at Rydalmere 
         
         
        On 1 September 2002 at Ultimo 
        
       
      
    131 In each case there were two offenders and one or more weapons in the form of knives or pistols (whether imitation of otherwise). In the case of the offences at Narwee, Matraville and Ultimo, each was preceded by one or more calls from a phone which contained a SIM card used by the Appellant and in the case of offences at Sans Souci and Rydalmere by a previous attendance of one or both of the offenders. In the case of all of the offences, persons present at the premises were tied up. With the possible exception of the robbery at Five Dock, the victim of which, Mr Dong, gave inconsistent accounts in this regard, on each occasion one offender was noticed to be taller than the other. The Appellant acknowledged that John Yin was the taller of the two.  
     
      
    132 The modus operandi involved in all offences was such as to strongly suggest, if not compel, the conclusion that they had at least one common author. The evidence before the jury that John Yin had pleaded guilty to offences of armed robbery on 16, 23, 26, and 29 August and 1 September 2002 involving Mr Dong, Ms Kunthanong, Ms Kwong, Mr Yuan, Ms Lu and Ms Chow provided yet further evidence in that regard in relation to those offences. 
     
      
    133 There was uncontested evidence that the Appellant had on 25 and again on 30 August 2002 pawned a Longines watch stolen during the course of the robbery on 16 August 2002. In an ERISP the Appellant said he had bought the watch from John Yin. The Appellant didn’t have money at the time, Mr Yin needed some, so the Appellant bought the watch, pawned it and gave the purchase price $50 or $100 to Mr Yin. In evidence the Appellant could give no explanation for why he didn’t suggest to Mr Yin that the latter pawn the watch. It is not unfair to say that the Appellant’s explanation for his transactions involving the watch, more detail of which appears in the reasons of Beasley JA, is absurd and his dealing with it provides strong evidence of his involvement in the first of the robberies. 
     
      
    134 Asked in an ERISP which occurred on 25 October 2002 about use of the SIM card to which reference has been made, the Appellant agreed he had had sole use of the SIM card for the last “two, three, four months”. However, he went on to say that sometimes at work someone would pick up “a” – it may be inferred he meant his – phone and use it. A little later, after John Yin was mentioned, the Appellant said Mr Yin used his phone a lot either at work or when he visited the Appellant at home and sometimes took it away for a while. 
     
      
    135 Called to give evidence during his trial, the Appellant was unable to name the persons apart from John Yin who used his phone. 
     
      
    136 While it might be going too far to describe the Appellant’s statements and evidence as to the use of his phone by others as absurd, it is fair to say that both in what he said and in the manner of his telling it, the Appellant’s accounts appeared as inherently improbable. Unless one accepts the Appellant’s statements as to others using his phone and draws the inference that that use extended to making the calls to the Narwee, Matraville and Ultimo brothels shortly before the robberies there occurred, the fact that those calls were from a phone that included the Appellant’s SIM card provides strong evidence of his involvement in the robberies at those premises. 
     
      
    137 Other evidence against the Appellant included that of a number of persons who had been at the brothels at the time of the robberies and who identified photographs of the Appellant as depicting one of the robbers. However, the strength of this evidence of identification varied significantly from one witness to another and it is necessary to consider what each said and also any other matter that might be thought to have any possibility of a significant impact on the jury’s assessment of the weight of the identification evidence. It may be noted that Mr Dong, Ms He, Ms Lu, Ms Chow and Mr Dao were shown copies of one photograph of the Appellant and Ms Kanthanong, Ms Kwon and Mr Yuan were shown copies of a different photograph. There is a substantial difference between the photos. It was common ground that the photographs picked out by these witnesses as photographs of the Appellant were in fact of him. 
     
      
    138 Mr Dong was a receptionist at the Five Dock premises on the occasion of the robbery there. On 20 November 2002 he was shown two series of photographs by police officers. 
     
      
    139 During his perusal of the first series of photographs, he rejected a number of pictures fairly quickly saying, “these ones are not, definitely”. However, there was appreciable hesitation while he looked at two other photographs. As between these two he said there was “more percentage this picture” and later when referring to the second, “I don’t think this is the one, because too many spots (later referred to as “chicken pox”) on there”. Later again when asked, “What percentage would you, would you say likely this person is the person” (sic), he said “80%” and “if the guy is real, I can say 100%. It’s a picture. The real percent is 100%. It’s the picture”. There was certainly no immediate identification such as to suggest confidence in the result. In evidence Mr Dong said that the reason he had picked out this photograph was that it was of the crew-cut man who robbed him. Other evidence showed that at about the time, Mr Yin did not have a crew cut but the Appellant did. 
     
      
    140 When shown the second set of photographs and even before he had seen them all, Mr Dong picked out one and said “this one for sure”. Later, when reminded that he had said 80% during the course of his consideration of the first set of photographs and asked about the photograph he had identified in the second set, he said “same as that, 80%. Even more, maybe 5, maybe 85%. But the picture is the picture.” And later “I can’t 100%, 80%, 85%.” 
     
      
    141 According to a Sergeant Davey who gave evidence – and this appears to have been common ground - the photograph Mr Dong identified in the second group was of John Yin.  
     
      
    142 It should be mentioned also that at one stage Mr Dong said that one of the men was shorter than he himself was. Later and somewhat inconsistently Mr Dong also said both were of the same height.  
     
      
    143 A Ms Kanthanong was present at the robbery on 23 August 2002. She was shown a series of photographs on 3 October 2002 and picked out one as the shorter of the two men involved in the robbery. During the course of her identification attempt, the person interpreting for her said “must be this one” and “number 16, this one 80%”. However, the selection of those two passages from the totality of the transcript of Ms Kanthanong’s identification is very misleading. When either that totality is considered or the video recording of the identification exercise is seen, it is apparent that Ms Kanthanong’s identification was very, very indefinite. 
     
      
    144 A Ms Kwong was also present at the 23 August 2002 robbery. On 3 October 2002 she was shown 3 folders of photographs and picked out one photograph. She confirmed these matters during a later video recording and that the photograph she had picked out was numbered 16. In evidence she said that the person depicted was the shorter of the two offenders.  
     
      
    145 A Ms He was present at the 25 August robbery. On 14 November 2002 she was shown a series of photographs and, as her actions demonstrate, very firmly identified 2 as those of the persons who had participated in the robbery. One was of the Appellant and assuming there has been no interference with the order of photographs in Exhibit H, this was, according to Ms He, a photograph of the shorter of the 2 robbers.  
     
      
    146 Asked as to the certainty of her identification, when seeing the photographs Ms He said 200% in the case of the Appellant and 100% in the case of the taller offender. In evidence she said that she was 100% sure in the case of the shorter man but could not be 100% sure in the case of the taller man. 
     
      
    147 The second photograph identified by Ms He was, according to Sergeant Davey, not of Mr Yin. (It should be remembered that Mr Yin had not pleaded guilty to an offence on the day the robbery at Ms He’s premises occurred.) 
     
      
    148 Mr Zhou was Ms He’s husband. He gave evidence of 2 men attending at the Sans Souci premises 2 days before the robbery, of some short conversation and of the men then leaving, as if they were customers tired of waiting. Shown a series of photographs on 14 November 2002, he identified a photograph of the Appellant, saying in the witness box that it depicted the shorter of the 2 men who had so attended. The transcript of the audio tape of Mr Zhou’s consideration of the photographs – the video tape equipment malfunctioned – records Mr Zhou as saying, “I am not sure, but it resembles”, that he would be more sure if he could see the height of the person and, asked how similar the person in the photograph was to the person spoken to at the brothel, Mr Zhou said, “Just the face, 70 or 80%”.  
     
      
    149 Mr Xuan was the owner of the brothel at Matraville. He was there on the day of the robbery at those premises. On 10 October he attended a police station and looked at a bundle of photographs. He set aside two photographs and said and in his manner indicated that he was 100% sure one was a photograph of the short robber but not 100% sure the second photograph was of the taller robber. As has been said, the photograph identified as that of the shorter robber is a copy of a photograph of the Appellant. 
     
      
    150 Sergeant Davey gave evidence that the second photograph was not of Mr Yin. Certainly the person depicted looks very different from the person identified by Sergeant Davey as Mr Yin in Exhibit D 
     
      
    151 A Ms Lu was present at Rydalmere on 29 August 2002. On 20 November 2002 she was shown 2 sets of photographs. Out of the first set she selected one. In summary she said that the photo looked a bit like the younger and taller robber and the robber with short hair – other evidence indicated that that description fitted the Appellant – did not appear at all in the first set.  
     
      
    152 Ms Lu was then shown a second set of photographs. After putting about 6 or to one side, she reacted to the next as if she instantly and definitely recognised the person depicted. She then considered a few more and also put them aside. However much of the transcript of the questions and answers, all via an interpreter, that followed the apparent recognition is in terms calculated to cast doubt on the firmness of that recognition. It includes expressions, “seems like this person”, “look like that person”, “If I can see the real person then … I can say” and “I just feel that he is that person”. Nevertheless at a later stage when she was asked “How strongly do you feel that this is the person?”, she is recorded as replying “I think this picture is the same” and “…this guy I would say the similarity over 90%”. Between the question and first of these answers there were 8 exchanges between the interpreter and Ms Lu and 3 exchanges between the first and second answers. She then added, “Because there is differ, obvious difference between real people and picture, and you can’t, you can’t seen his height”. 
     
      
    153 In evidence she said that she selected the photograph because she recognised the person as the shorter man who robbed her. In should also be mentioned that in evidence Ms Lu said the shorter person had a gun although in her statement she attributed the only gun to which she referred as held by the taller robber. 
     
      
    154 Ms Chow was present on 1 September 2002 at the Ultimo brothel and described the robbery there. On 18 November 2002 she was shown 3 sets of photographs, much but not all of the conversation being interpreted. Out of the first set she selected one saying “this one is 70% I guess” and referred to the person depicted as that “short person”. She then asked to see more pictures, indicating she had not seen enough and that if there is someone else (in further pictures) who was similar, then there would be a waste of time. Shown a second set she again put aside one photograph saying that it was of the taller person. She did not pick out any photograph from a third set.  
     
      
    155 Saying “100%, not sure, I have to look again” Ms Chow did so, then remarking, “I am sure. 1000%”. 
     
      
    156 In evidence, Ms Chow said that she looked through the photographs she was shown and selected two, one the taller man and one the shorter man. Shown a group of photographs in court, which may have been one of the set but which certainly contained fewer than the totality of those Ms Chow saw at the police station, she identified one bearing her signature as that of the shorter man.  
     
      
    157 Included in the items stolen on 29 August from Ms Lu was a mobile phone. A Mr Dao gave evidence of having purchased a mobile phone at the end of August from a man at a club who had 2 phones to sell. On 11 December 2002 Mr Dao was shown by police a series of photographs and selected one. During the course of the interview Mr Dao said that the photo looked like the person who sold him the phone but he was not sure and in order to make sure the police should look at the video recordings at the club. Asked how sure he was that the photo was of the man who sold him the phone Mr Dao said 80 to 90%. Asked to write something on the selected photo to identify it, Mr Dao wrote words to the effect “He looks like the one who sold me the phone”. There was evidence that the phone purchased by Mr Dao was shown by police to Ms Lu but, I think, no evidence to indicate that it was hers.  
     
      
    158 In summary the eyewitness evidence identifying the Appellant as a participant in the robberies was as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        Five Dock Mr Dong 80% likelihood 
        
       
       
        
        Narwee Ms Kanthanong very, very indefinite 
         
         Ms Kwong no reservations 
        
       
       
        
        Sans Souci Ms He 100% likelihood  
         
         Mr Zhou 70-80% likelihood 
        
       
       
        
        Matraville Mr Xuan 100% likelihood 
        
       
       
        
        Rydalmere Ms Lu varying between “I feel” and 
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
                
                almost certainty 
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Ultimo Ms Chow 100% 
        
       
      
    159 Considered in isolation some parts of this evidence clearly have their weakness. However when regard is had to the totality and to the other aspects of the evidence to which reference has been made, the case against the Appellant in respect of each of the charges was compelling. In these circumstances, it is appropriate to apply the proviso to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act – see Wilde v R [1987-1988] 164 CLR 365 at 372; Festa v R [2001] 208 CLR 593. 
     
      
       
       
      Application for Leave to Appeal against Sentence 
      
    160 The effective sentence imposed on the Appellant was for a total period of 12 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 10 years. He had been acquitted on counts 3 and 4 and the individual sentences imposed were:- 
     
      
       
        
      Count 
       
        
        1. Imprisonment for 6 years including a non-parole period of 4½ years both such periods to commence on 25 October 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        2 & 5 Imprisonment for 7 years including a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months both such periods to commence on 25 October 2002. 
         
         
        6, 7 & 8 Imprisonment for 8 years including a non-parole period of 6 years both such periods to commence on 25 October 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        9 & 10 Imprisonment for 9 years including a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months both such periods to commence on 25 January 2006. 
         
        
       
      
    161 The effective sentence of 12 years and 3 months seems to reflect some error in his Honour’s maths. In his remarks on sentence his Honour observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I have taken into account the necessity to consider totality and in assessing the questions of concurrence and cumulation, I have come to the view that the minimum term to be served is ten years with the head sentence effectively being thirteen years and three months. That is not precisely a ration of 75% but near enough to it.”  
        
       
      
    162 The property stolen in the offences was respectively as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        1. A Longines wrist watch, a mobile telephone and $600. 
        
       
       
        
        2. A gold coloured wrist watch and $120. 
        
       
       
        
        5. A mobile telephone and $100. 
        
       
       
        
        6. $850. 
        
       
       
        
        7. A necklace 
        
       
       
        
        8. 2 mobile phones and $1,500 
        
       
       
        
        9. A gold chain and pendant and a gold ring. 
        
       
      
    163 I agree with Beazley JA that leave to appeal should be given notwithstanding the Appellant is out of time. I also agree with her Honour that Judge Dodd did not err in the form in which he imposed sentence. His Honour followed the procedure required by s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, as it applied to the Appellant’s offences, of first setting the term of the sentence and then setting the relevant non-parole period. 
     
      
    164 I thirdly agree with her Honour’s conclusion that the Appellant’s complaint of lack of parity with the sentences imposed on the co-offender Yin is not made out. 
     
      
    165 I fourthly agree with her Honour that Judge Dodd erred in thinking that he was required to escalate the sentences he imposed in respect of the later offences simply because they were later.  
     
      
    166 I fifthly agree with her Honour that to group the offences for the purposes of sentence, as Judge Dodd did, was to risk error. However, that course is not inappropriate at times, including those when a sentencing judge has to deal with a substantial number of offences. Beazley JA has taken the view that in the circumstances of this case, eight offences, that course is not justified. In this I disagree with her Honour because whether the course of grouping is to be followed is largely a matter of discretion, and in my view, eight charges is a sufficient number to entitle a judge to take the course Judge Dodd did. 
     
      
    167 I turn to the length of the sentences Judge Dodd imposed. In R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 this Court provided a guideline as to the appropriate sentence for offences having a number of identified characteristics, viz. - 
     
      
       
      “(i) Young offender with no or little criminal history. 
       
      (ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 
       
      (iii) Limited degree of planning. 
       
      (iv) … 
       
      (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.”  
       
      
    168 The guideline was a head sentence in the range of 4 to 5 years. As a guideline, that range was indicative only – see at [29] - and even then it was but a starting point when the circumstances accorded with those assumed. Other or different factors were liable to operate so as to increase or reduce a sentence from the range indicated – see at [169]. 
     
      
    169 The circumstances here were substantially worse and required a higher sentence for each offence. The Appellant’s prior conviction and imprisonment for five earlier armed robberies placed him a long way from the situation contemplated in paragraph (i); there was also more than a limited degree of planning for each offence; and he did not plead guilty. The latter fact alone could be expected to lead to a sentence something of the order of a year longer than the 4-5 year term contemplated in R v Henry.  
     
      
    170 In light of that decision and those differences it is impossible to conclude that a sentence less severe than the 6 year term, including a non-parole period of 4½ years, imposed in respect of count 1 was “warranted in law and should have been passed”. In this situation, s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act requires that the appeal against that sentence be dismissed. The same must be said in respect of the sentences of 7 years, including non-parole periods of 5 years and 3 months imposed in respect of counts 2 and 5. It is impossible to say that those sentences are manifestly excessive and outside the proper range of Judge Dodd’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    171 Nor does the fact that the sentence imposed in respect of count 1 was only 6 years require any different conclusion. I know of no principle of law or sentencing practice, or authority, that requires a sentence in itself proper to be reduced simply because another sentence imposed on the same offender for a comparable offence – a sentence that, by the standards of R v Henry, can only be regarded as lenient – is less. Absent such a requirement, I find it impossible to say that lesser sentences “should have been passed” on counts 2 and 5.  
     
      
    172 (I should perhaps add that, had the sentences for counts 1, 2 and 5 been the only ones imposed, I would have regarded the choice of the same starting date for count 1 as for the other sentences indicative of error. However, given the Appellant was being sentenced for 8 offences and a substantial degree of concurrency was thus required, his Honour was entitled to commence the sentences on counts 1, 2 and 5 as he did.) 
     
      
    173 Uninstructed by the decision of this Court in the case of the Appellant’s co-offender, R v Yin [2005] NSWCCA 138, I would take the view that the sentences of 8 and 9 years imposed in respect of the remaining counts, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 were outside the legitimate exercise of his Honour’s discretion. In so concluding I am not unconscious that 8 years is but one more than 7 years and that I have taken the view that that period was one which was within his Honour’s discretion. However a line must be drawn somewhere and I regard it as falling below 8 years. The offences the subject of these counts are too far from a “worst case” of offences under s97(1) of the Crimes Act (which provides a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment) to justify such a penalty, and this notwithstanding that the Appellant was sentenced in 1993 to 4 years’ imprisonment (including an 18 month non-parole period) on 5 counts of armed robbery.  
     
      
    174 In this connection it is relevant to bear in mind the limited scope of the offences, the relatively small amount and value of the property taken or likely to have been available and that there was little if any evidence of any major trauma having been suffered by the victims. Furthermore, although as I have often said statistics have their limitations, it may be noted that a sentence of 8 years falls into the top 3% of sentences for single offences under s97(1). Nor do I see in the difference in the value of the property taken in the offences the subject of counts 6 to 10 any ground for distinguishing between the sentences imposed for the offences the subject of these counts and those the subject of counts 1, 2 and 5. Given the nature of the offences, such difference as there was, was simply a matter of pure chance and is not such as to merit any higher punishment than those imposed for the earlier counts. 
     
      
    175 In R v Yin this Court dismissed an appeal by Yin against the sentences imposed on him by Judge Tupman on 7 charges. These were:- 
     
      
       
        
        (i) for the same offence as that the subject of count 1 against the Appellant, imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years and 6 months; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) for the same offence as that the subject of count 2 against the Appellant, imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 years; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) for the same offence as that the subject of count 5 against the Appellant, imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 years; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) for the same offence as that the subject of count 8 against the Appellant, albeit laid under s97(2) of the Crimes Act, imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 years; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) for the same offence as that the subject of count 10 against the Appellant, albeit laid under s97(2) of the Crimes Act, imprisonment for a fixed term of 6½ years; and 
        
       
       
        
         (vi) for the same offence as that the subject of count 9 against the Appellant, albeit laid under s97(2) of the Crimes Act, imprisonment for a fixed term of 7 years; 
        
       
       
        
         (vii) for another offence under s97(2) of robbery of a shop proprietor and in circumstances of little premeditation, imprisonment for 7 years including a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months. 
        
       
      
    176 These periods were arrived at after her Honour had made allowance for Yin’s pleas of guilty, allowances which, as her Honour indicated elsewhere in her remarks were of, or of the order of, 25%. When such discounts are added back, her sentences represent undiscounted figures as high as 8 and 9 1/3 years. 
     
      
    177 Judge Tupman’s observations and the length of some of the sentences make it clear that some of the sentences do reflect an increase from those which would otherwise have been imposed because her Honour was asked to take into account one or more offences on Form 1s. However that is not so in the case of the sentences referred to in the paragraphs I have numbered (v) and (vii) and the dismissal of Yin’s appeal thus argues against my initial reaction that the sentences imposed on the Appellant under counts 7, 8, 9 and 10 are manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    178 To what extent, if at all, the fact that many of the charges against Yin were preferred pursuant to s97(2) where the maximum penalty is 25 years, was regarded as of significance is not apparent from Judge Tupman’s remarks or the judgments in this Court. However what is of significance is the fact that the only arguments advanced in support of Yin’s appeal – see at [10] - were that the allowance for Yin’s pleas was inadequate, secondly that a finding of special circumstances should have led to a lower effective non-parole period, and thirdly that the aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive. Furthermore, the argument on the third, which is the only one of any possible relevance here, seems to have been concentrated fairly narrowly. At [16], Hidden J, in whose remarks Sully and Dunford JJ concurred, said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Smith’s argument that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive centred upon the sentence in respect of the seventh charge which, he said, has led to an overall sentence greater than was called for by the whole of the applicant’s criminality. He relied not only upon the length of that particular sentence, but also upon the fact that it was directed to commence on 8 October 2006, two years and nine months after the commencement of the sentence on the sixth charge. He noted that such partial accumulation as there was on the other six sentences was much more modest, amounting in all to one year and three months. He submitted that her Honour failed to pass a sentence on the seventh charge appropriate to that particular offence, in breach of the familiar principles enunciated by the High Court in  
        Pearce v The Queen  
        (1998) 194 CLR 610.”  
        
       
      
    179 Later Hidden J characterised the seven year sentence on the seventh charge as “severe”. 
     
      
    180 It is, as I have said, not clear what weight the Court gave to the difference between s97(1) and s97(2) in the penalty prescribed. Nor is it apparent how much weight was given to the Form 1 offences. There were 5 of them and Judge Tupman’s remarks made it clear that the sentences in respect of the offences I have numbered (ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi) were appreciably increased on account of these offences. So far as the report reveals, no authorities providing any guidance as to the appropriate range of sentences for multiple offences were cited to the Court. In these circumstances, I do not regard the decision in R v Yin as obliging me to reach a conclusion different from that I have expressed concerning the length of the sentences on counts 6 to 10. Even if the result is one of disparity, I do not regard the decision in R v Yin as obliging me to impose on the Appellant sentences higher than I would otherwise regard as appropriate.  
     
      
    181 Reference should be made also to a number of decisions referred to in R v El-Andouri [2004] NSWCCA 178 to which counsel for the Appellant directed the Court. These included:- 
     
      
       
        
        R v Uasi 
         [1999] NSWCCA 306 - 1 x bank robbery in company, 1 x attempted aggravated bank robbery with wounding, 2 x armed robbery + (on Form 1) 11 robberies of banks, staff and customers, 5 other robberies - proceeds approximately $238,000 - sentence 12 years total and 8 years minimum;  
        
       
       
        
        Bavadra  
        (2000) 115 A Crim R 152 – Crown Appeal - 2 x robbery with offensive weapon, 2 x robbery in company, 3 x robbery with a dangerous weapon + on (Form 1) 9 other similar robberies and 2 more minor offences – proceeds approximately $60,000 – sentence 12 years total and 8 years minimum; 
        
       
       
        
        R v Itamua  
        [2000] NSWCCA 502 – 42 x robbery with a dangerous weapon, 2 more minor charges – proceeds over $190,000 - 17 years total and 11 years non-parole;  
        
       
       
        
        Karaman 
         (2002) 128 A Crim R 72 - Crown Appeal - 1 x robbery in company, 1 x aggravated robbery with wounding, 2 more minor offences - 12 years total and 9 years non-parole; and  
        
       
       
        
        R v Budd  
        [2002] NSWCCA 302 – 1 x robbery with wounding, 13 x robbery while armed with an offensive weapon, 1 x assault with intent to rob while armed + (on Form 1) 10 similar offences – victims mainly shopkeepers etc. – proceeds over $11,000 - sentence 12½ years total and 8½ years non-parole.  
        
       
      
    182 It was submitted that these cases point to the conclusion that the sentences imposed in this case were too high. Bavadra, Itamua and Karaman were Crown Appeals but even making allowance for this and a number of other particular features in some of the cases, as a group the decisions certainly do support the Appellant’s contention. The difficulty I have is in accepting either that the cases are representative of all cases in this area or should be followed. So far as the first of these matters is concerned this Court has, on innumerable occasions, eschewed arguments as to severity based on one or a few selected cases. Both general experience in the Court and references in Bavadra indicate those selected are not representative. So far as the second of the matters is concerned it seems to me that a number of the sentences imposed were extremely lenient and though the cases mentioned have caused me to pause, I prefer to base my decision on the terms of s97(1) and, with some guidance from the decision in R v Henry, what I perceive to be the needs of general and personal deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation and the protection of the community in this case.  
     
      
    183 Before I turn to the issue of what sentences in lieu of those I regard as erroneous should be imposed, I must refer to another error made in the sentencing of the Appellant, viz. that there was no evidence that the Appellant committed the offences for the purpose of obtaining funds to fund a drug addiction. What his Honour said in this connection was:- 
     
      
    184 A Pre-sentence Report indicated that the Appellant had commenced heroin use in 1996 and used it thereafter during a number of periods, the latest commencing in June 2002. The Pre-Sentence report recorded that the Appellant “attempted to detoxify in August 2002”. A psychologist’s report also referred to the Appellant having been addicted and there having been intense use in the months before receiving a Naltrexone implant. Notes of Dr Tan who inserted the implant record that on 1 October 2002 the Appellant was in “day 2 or day 3 of detox”. The Appellant gave evidence on sentence and provided confirmation of some of these matters. Subject to the matters referred to in the next paragraph, he was not challenged. 
     
      
    185 Included in the Appellant’s evidence was the statement that in August/September he was “doing detox at home” and, in answer to a question from Judge Dodds, that he had told the psychologist that in August and September he was housebound undergoing a home detoxification with his Naltrexone implant.  
     
      
    186 The latter statement of course conflicts with the jury’s verdict and with some of the evidence to which I have referred.  
     
      
    187 To the evidence so far mentioned may be added the fact that the Appellant associated with John Yin who the evidence suggested was using drugs and some matters of which the Court may take judicial notice, viz. that heroin is notoriously difficult to give up once a person is addicted; that the habit is almost impossible to fund except by crime; and also that pawn brokers interest rates are high and the pawning of goods is evidence of some urgent need of funds. In totality, there was thus a wealth of evidence that at the time of committing the offences the Appellant was in fact addicted, and that the offences were committed as a result. (I put to one side the information his Honour had that a syringe had fallen out of the Appellant’s coat, information which may not have been formally tendered before his Honour.)  
     
      
    188 The significance of his Honour’s finding is apparent in the following passage from his remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        It has been contended on your behalf by submissions from your counsel that I should find that you have good prospects of rehabilitation. This is based upon the fact of your previous drug abuse and what I accept are your efforts to overcome your drug addiction both before and since your arrest and during your time in custody since your arrest and what I accept to be some considerable achievement in that regard. The difficulty in using that as a basis for concluding that you have good prospects of rehabilitation is that there is no evidence that you committed these offences in any way as a result of your drug addiction. There is simply no evidence before me to indicate for instance, that you committed these offences for the purpose of obtaining funds to fund your drug addiction, nor is there evidence of any other connection. 
        
       
       
        
        Indeed, the evidence, if anything, as all the other way. As I say it makes it difficult to conclude that your efforts and success in dealing with your drug addiction indicate any efforts or success in rehabilitation in respect of the commission of these offences or the prospect of committing such offences in the future. I am therefore not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that your prospects of rehabilitation are good. It seems to me in view, in particular, of your relative youth but also on account of you previous drug addiction and your efforts in overcoming that, that it would be open to me to find special circumstances. However, in view of the structure of the sentences that I am about to impose I have come to the view that it is neither necessary nor desirable to alter to any extent the ratio of non-parole period to a head sentence by increasing the parole period as opposed to the non-parole period. 
        
       
      
    189 Of course, if one accepts the Appellant’s evidence that he commenced detoxification as early as August 2002 and in August and September was housebound, a finding that the offences were not the result of a heroin addiction is justified but this is not the way his Honour reasoned. It must be recognised that this Court has not seen the Appellant in the witness box and that there are obvious difficulties in this Court making a finding of fact in the face of the Appellant’s evidence. Nevertheless the other evidence to which I have referred seems to me so compelling that this Court should conclude that the Appellant was addicted at the time of the offences and that this was at least a major inspiration for them.  
     
      
    190 Judge Dodd’s failure to be persuaded that the Appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation were good notwithstanding his Honour’s findings that the Appellant had made some considerable achievement in his efforts to overcome his addiction, was a consequence of his view that there was no evidence that the offences were the result of drug addiction. In light of my conclusion that this view was wrong, the achievement of which his Honour spoke and the fact that the Appellant voluntarily undertook efforts in this regard prior to and quite independently of being charged with his offences – efforts for which he is to be commended - leads me to the view that this Court should approach the challenge to the sentences imposed without regard to Judge Dodd’s findings as to the Appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    191 That does not of course mean that this Court should adopt an opposite view. The Appellant’s prospects in this regard are a matter of mitigation and the evidence is by no means as favourable to him as occurs in some cases. There is of course the evidence of some detoxification and of obtaining the Naltrexone implant prior to being arrested, and although this seems to have been inspired at least in part by his de facto or family, the fact of taking these steps does provide some hope that the Appellant has seen the error of his ways. He has deposed to being drug-free in prison and that that has been confirmed by urinalysis. His plea of not guilty provides no evidence of remorse or acceptance of responsibility for his offending. The Pre-sentence Report gives the Appellant no comfort in this regard beyond saying that the Appellant has the support of his partner of 4 years and of his family. However, it is obvious that they were not enough to prevent the offending that led to these proceedings. 
     
      
    192 A psychological report in evidence included statements that the Appellant suffered longstanding symptoms of depression, anxiety and low self-esteem and while giving credit for the Appellant’s progress in overcoming his addiction said that it was of concern that he had not received any psychotherapy directed to the underlying cause of his problem. It assessed him as bright enough to respond to such treatment. An affidavit tendered during the hearing of the appeal stated that the Appellant had undertaken as many courses as were available to him but none of those he had undertaken fulfilled the advice of the psychologist.  
     
      
    193 In the result, although one can say that there are reasonable prospects of the Appellant being rehabilitated by the time he emerges from custody, it does not seem to me that the evidence is sufficient to enable one to say that his prospects in this regard are as high as “good”. 
     
      
    194 Being required by the conclusions at which I have arrived to determine myself the length of the sentences imposed on counts 7, 8, 9 and 10, and although I regard the sentences of 6 years and 7 years imposed by Judge Dodd on counts 1, 2 and 5 as within the appropriate sentencing range, subject to the remarks that follow, I would fix for each offence a non-parole period of 5 years and a full term of 6 years and 8 months. Each of the Appellant’s offences requires a sentence significantly longer than the guideline sentence indicated in R v Henry even though principles of totality will limit the effective operation of each sentence. (I may add that I am not unconscious that most of what I may refer to as the parole periods will be concurrent with other non-parole periods and, except in the case of the last 1 or 2 offence, it might have therefore been cleaner to impose fixed terms. However, having decided that there should be no interference with the sentences imposed by Judge Dodd on counts 1, 2 and 5, I am disposed to follow his Honour in imposing non-parole periods and longer total sentences.) 
     
      
    195 I turn then to the topics of totality, accumulation and concurrency. Clearly it is not appropriate to simply accumulate all of the non-parole periods. The issue is what effective total non-parole period and sentence properly reflect the Appellant’s criminality and other circumstances. The matter is one where there is no single correct answer and one upon which minds can readily and reasonably differ. The conclusion at which I have arrived is that an appropriate result is a non-parole period of 7½ years and a full term of 10 years. Incarceration for either of these periods involves a major imposition on a lifespan of the order of 75 years and in the case of someone like the Appellant, born in June 1974, is calculated to have an effect on his life – work, home, family etc - lasting long beyond the imprisonment itself. The periods also reflect a significant increase above the guideline suggested in R v Henry and also the penalty appropriate for one offence, making it clear to anyone in the position that the Appellant was in that the commission of one offence does not enable the commission of others with impunity.  
     
      
    196 In arriving at the periods referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, I have given appreciable weight to the fact that the Appellant, of his own volition, even if partly inspired by his girl-friend, took significant steps to cure himself of his addiction. I should also record that I have taken into account the other matters referred to in s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act although, given the factors argued in the appeal, I do not regard it as necessary to spell these out.  
     
      
    197 One matter which has caused me concern is that the sentence I propose is, particularly when account is taken of the fact that Yin pleaded guilty, appreciably less than that imposed on the latter. However, as Beazley JA has pointed out, although Yin faced only seven substantive charges (compared with the Appellant’s eight), he also had five Form 1 matters taken into account and was not regarded as having good prospects of rehabilitation. The remarks on sentence of Judge Tupman who sentenced Yin make it clear that the sentences for the offences where Form 1 offences were taken into account were higher than they would otherwise have been.  
     
      
    198 I do not find it necessary to analyse the differences further. It is sufficient to say that the sentences imposed on Yin, even if the result of this appeal is to create disparity, do not persuade me that those imposed and to be imposed on the Appellant should be higher than I have indicated.  
     
      
    199 I should mention also that in arriving at the conclusions I have, I have given consideration to whether there should be any finding of special circumstances. I see no basis for such a finding except the accumulation of sentences and would structure the last sentence so that the ratio of 3:1 contemplated by s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is achieved for the overall sentence. Given the total result of the sentences, that will achieve a sufficiently long non-parole period.  
     
      
    200 Accordingly, the orders I would propose are:- 
     
      
       
        
        1. Dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Dismiss the appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of count 1, viz. that the Appellant be imprisoned for 6 years including a non-parole period of 4½ years, both such periods to commence on 25 October 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Dismiss the appeal against the sentences imposed in respect of counts 2 and 5, viz. that for each offence the Appellant be imprisoned for 7 years including a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months, both such periods to commence on 25 October 2002. 
         
          
         
         
        5. Allow the appeals against the sentences imposed in respect of counts 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 and quash those sentences. 
        
       
       
        
        6. In respect of count 6, sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 25 October 2003 with a balance of term of 1 year and 8 months. 
        
       
       
        
        7. In respect of count 7, sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 25 April 2004 with a balance of term of 1 year and 8 months. 
        
       
       
        
        8. In respect of count 8, sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 25 October 2004 with a balance of term of 1 year and 8 months. 
        
       
       
        
        9. In respect of count 9, sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 25 April 2005 with a balance of term of 1 year and 8 months. 
        
       
       
        
        10. In respect of count 10, sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 25 April 2006 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. 
        
       
       
        
        11. Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Appellant will be first eligible for parole, 25 April 2010.  
        
       
      
    201 HISLOP J: I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley JA and generally with her Honour's reasons.

   1 The plaintiff brings proceedings against the defendant for negligence for injuries he suffered on 19 October 2003 when he slipped and fell at the Domino’s Pizza outlet at 230 Elizabeth Street Surry Hills. The plaintiff does not press a claims (pleaded in the alternative) for breach of the Trade Practices Act 1975 (Cth) or of the Occupational Health & Safety Act 2000 (NSW). The defendant’s defence pleads, inter alia, an allegation that the plaintiff’s fall was fraudulently contrived.2 The circumstances of the plaintiff’s accident were as follows. At about midday on 19 October 2003 the plaintiff went to Domino’s Pizza outlet at 230 Elizabeth Street Surry Hills and ordered a pizza. Having placed his order he went outside to have a cigarette. When he finished his cigarette he went back into the store to see if his pizza was ready. When he was told that it was not ready he walked towards the exit and stepped on the metal strip which was mounted on the edge of the right hand side of the sloping ramp leading from the service counter out towards the street.3 When the plaintiff stepped on the metal strip it moved. The plaintiff said his legs went from under him and he fell landing on his bottom on the floor of the shop. He was unable to get to his feet.4 Mr Okkes Yildiz, the shift supervisor, who was making the plaintiff’s pizza, heard a sound and turned around and returned to the counter, where he saw the plaintiff lying on the tiled surface on his back. The plaintiff responded to an enquiry as to his well-being by asking Mr Yildiz to call an ambulance.5 Mr Yildiz who was called by the defendant, gave evidence that he was curious as to what caused the plaintiff to fall. He went to the back of the shop to look at the CCTV of the plaintiff’s fall (T-188) as soon as he realised the plaintiff had fallen down. He watched it for about ten seconds. He had occasion to look at the videotape on a second occasion, when he was with the manager, Nick Knight, and a gentleman named Kai. It was his recollection (T-192) that the plaintiff stepped on and off the metal strip “multiple times”. He qualified about this by saying “about two times he stepped on and off” and that he “looked around a couple of times” (T-192-193). He then “just kicked out his right foot as if he was kicking something, and then he fell back and his hand break (sic) his fall, and he must have hit his hand on the tile because that’s the noise I heard” (T-193). He was quite sure what the noise was because he had tiles in his home and when his little brother hits his hand on the tile it makes a similar noise (T-194). 6 The only other person present at the time was a trade assistant named Rory Erwin. He could not remember anything about the CCTV footage although he recalled the plaintiff being injured and the ambulance being called.7 The difficulty the defendant has is that the CCTV footage that Mr Yildiz refers to in his evidence has since been lost. Evidence was given by Mr Nicholas Knight, the manager, and by Mr Salem Zakkaur concerning the circumstances in which this videotape, which both of them said they saw, was either thrown out by mistake or damaged by a fault in a computer onto which the videotape was copied, or both. Although the circumstances in which the plaintiff fell over in the defendant’s premises in circumstances requiring an ambulance where there was an immediate suspicion on attempted fraudulent conduct was clearly something out of the ordinary, there is no contemporaneous documentation of any of these events, including the circumstances in which the CCTV footage was copied and placed in a computer.8 In addition, a matter of days later a person was observed taking photographs of the premises for the plaintiff. Once again, this was recorded on the videotape. Once again, it would appear that this videotape was damaged or destroyed and no other contemporaneous record kept either of this event or of the need to retain this tape. 9 After the plaintiff commenced these proceedings, the defendant filed a defence, answered subpoenas and conducted the litigation for some time without bringing the allegation of fraud. This allegation was first raised approximately two weeks before the first time the matter was listed for hearing; the hearing had to be vacated as a result. 10 The relevant interlocutory steps in which the defendant failed to raise the claim of fraud were as follows: 
     
      
      (a) The defendant filed a defence on 22 September 2005 which did not raise this allegation (the allegation was not made until an amended defence filed on 13 December 2005).  
       
       
      (b) The defendant was served with subpoena to provide documentation on or about 17 November 2005 but produced no documents, including no documentation about any attempts made to locate the missing footage. 
       
       
      (c) The defendant filed a list of documents which disclosed no documents on this issue. Significantly, no claim was made that documents or other material that had once been in the defendant’s possession which was no longer available. 
       
       
      (d) The defendant failed to answer particulars and to put the plaintiff on notice of the proposed claim. 
       
      
    11 Thus, in addition to there being no contemporaneous documentation, there was a delay in bringing the allegation. This delay is unexplained.12 However, the most significant problem with the evidence is that the lay witnesses called by the defendant gave conflicting accounts not only as to what they saw on the tape when the plaintiff fell and where he fell, but also the time involved in the incident, what the plaintiff did whilst in the premises of the defendant and, most importantly, circumstances in which the original video tape and computer copies were either lost, damaged by a computer fault or both. In addition, it was never made clear to me how or when the loss or destruction of the video tape of the plaintiff’s friend visiting the premises a matter of days after the accident to take photos was similarly lost, destroyed, or both. 13 Finally, there is an inherent implausibility in the proposition that the plaintiff, whose evidence was that he had only been to the defendant’s premises once before, had gone there for the purpose of faking a fall, or alternatively made an on-the-spot decision to do so. While I am conscious of recent Court of Appeal decisions concerning the dangers of having regard to a witness’ demeanour, and while I have reservations about the plaintiff’s reliability on other issues relating to damages, the plaintiff is nevertheless a man of very limited intellectual ability, who is illiterate and has never worked, and whose ability to think up and put into action a fraudulent plan which involved injury to himself seems far-fetched.14 In considering issues of liability concerning the plaintiff’s fall, I must take into account, when considering the claim that the plaintiff’s fall was fraudulently contrived, Section 142 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The appropriate test, generally referred to as the Briginshaw test (Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336), is that the court must feel an actual persuasion of the occurrence of the fact alleged: Neat Holdings Pty Limited v Karajan Holdings Pty Limited & Ors (1992) 67 ALJR 170 at 170-1, explained in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited v Marsden [2002] NSWCA 419 at paragraph 61 per Levine J. I accept the submissions of counsel for the plaintiff is that what must be proved is what the video actually showed, as opposed to the opinion of those who saw it. In addition, the evidence must give rise to a reasonable and definite inference as opposed to conflicting inferences of equal degree of probability where the choice between them is a matter of opinion or conjecture: Luxton v Vines (1952) 85 CLR 352 at 358.8. 15 None of the witnesses who gave evidence had turned their minds to the incident in question for some years. One of those witnesses, Rory Erwin, who was the trainee in the shop with Mr Yildiz, said he could remember the accident because he heard someone yell and he saw the plaintiff on the ground but when asked if had a recollection of the CCTV video he said “no, not really”. The ambulance officer had no recollection, unsurprisingly.16 The other witnesses who were cross-examined gave accounts of having watched the video and attempted to describe what they saw. They gave a general description of seeing the plaintiff walking backwards and forwards, conduct Mr Knight said, significantly, was typical for people waiting for pizzas. Mr Yildiz said the plaintiff scuffed the metal strip numerous times but then corrected it to two or so times. Differing descriptions were given of how the plaintiff fell. Mr Knight said quite frankly he could not see what caused the plaintiff to fall. About the only issue that the witnesses were agreed upon was that the metal strip was loose. 17 The defendant’s submissions largely deal with the claim in paragraph 9 of the defendant’s amended defence that the plaintiff’s fall was fraudulently contrived. No submission was made in relation to negligence by the defendant other than to challenge the report of Mr Burns, the expert retained by the plaintiff, on the basis that he used the word “tripped” while the plaintiff’s case was that he “slipped”. 18 In fact the report of Mr Burns if of little assistance to me because it states the obvious, namely that if the plaintiff caught his foot in a metal strip and fell, where that metal strip was loose, then this was the reason for the fall. There is no doubt the metal strip was loose, because this was conceded by the defendant’s witnesses. The use by the plaintiff of the words “slip” or “trip” to Mr Burns needs to be treated with caution because the plaintiff is a man of limited intelligence.19 Mr Burn’s report contains the photograph that was taken by a friend of the plaintiff. That photograph is of significance. It shows not only the strip out of place but the worn tiles adjacent. The defendant submitted to me that I should draw the Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 presumption from the failure to make enquiries to locate the photographer and to call him to be cross-examined. However, the circumstances in which a friend of the plaintiff went to the pizza shop several days after the accident for the purpose of taking photographs is not in dispute. Not only was this gentleman filmed on CCTV taking photographs, but he informed the staff that the plaintiff was going to bring proceedings for damages. Unfortunately, this videotape is also missing.20 By reason of vagueness of recollection and inconsistencies between the evidence of these witnesses, particularly as to the length of time that the film in question took and when and where the videotape was subsequently lost, I am of the view that the evidence is not of sufficient probative weight to establish that the plaintiff’s fall was fraudulently contrived as asserted in paragraph 9 of the amended defence. 21 I permitted the calling of the evidence subject to objection to enable a finding as to its probative weight to be made. Mr Hall QC later withdrew the objection. It was, however, an objection that was well taken. Although the witnesses purport to be describing something they actually saw (i.e. the CCTV footage) there is a real likelihood of their evidence being misleading, because the fact that they claim to have seen CCTV footage confers an aura of veracity on their observations as opposed to the observations of a witness who actually saw the witness fall. I have no way of knowing how accurately the CCTV tape portrayed the plaintiff’s fall, as no evidence was led on this issue. Further, I am not satisfied by the explanations concerning the circumstances in which the CCTV footage of the plaintiff having his accident and the plaintiff’s friend visiting to take photographs was lost, destroyed or both.22 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established that by reason of the defendant’s negligence in permitting a metal strip to become loose and to be a hidden risk to persons entering and leaving the defendant’s pizza shop.23 I now turn to consider the issue of damages. The plaintiff’s evidence24 The plaintiff was born in Sydney on 30 May 1975. He had only a fairly rudimentary education, leaving school in 1990 at the end of Year 9. He commenced a course in carpentry and joinery at Randwick TAFE, but had difficulties because of literacy problems and had to abandon his studies. In 1991 he completed a TAFE course and he also attended some literacy courses at Randwick TAFE. After leaving TAFE he was involved in the Work for the Dole Scheme for approximately six months during which time he tended gardens at Sydney Park in Tempe. Apart from this he has never had any employment. In about 1997 the plaintiff’s mother underwent triple bypass surgery and the plaintiff applied to become her carer. He has received a pension as her carer since that time. 25 The plaintiff gave evidence that prior to the accident he enjoyed touch football, cycling, swimming and other sporting activities. His prior medical history is uneventful apart from a fracture of both forearms when he jumped from a tree when he was about ten years old. He was a shy, short, overweight man (Dr Revai notes he is 85 kilograms and 5’ 3” tall) with a marked squint. He told the court he had never worked apart from his brief “work for the dole” stint after a TAFE course, although he had been looking for work in the months before his accident because his mother, for whom he is a carer, seemed to be in better health.26 It was evident from the plaintiff’s answers to questions when he gave evidence that his intelligence was, as Dr Revai notes in his report of 23 May 2005 (at page 5) at the lower end of that considered normal. He was not an articulate witness and in the witness box showed the same passivity that Dr Revai said he was struck by. 27 In cross-examination, the plaintiff agreed that he was still helping his mother around the house and that he still received a carer’s pension for this (T-61). His claim about his sporting activities and assistance to his mother prior to the accident contains some elements of exaggeration. By comparison, the plaintiff’s mother gave evidence that the plaintiff did “some sport and swimming with the boys” but that in the winter time he mainly watched sport (T-136) but the only other activity she could recall was that he liked to go fishing. She described his activities around the house as being cleaning up, washing up, putting the washing out but not working in the garden because he was “not a garden person” (T-136). In contrast to the plaintiff portraying himself as being in constant pain, she described him as taking Panadol after the accident (T-137-138) and complaining “at least a couple of times a week” (T-137) about his back. She said that as a result he was more cranky and not as active and that his post-accident housework activities consist of occasionally putting a bit of washing out and that he no longer mopped the floor. 28 In cross-examination Mrs Hurcum agreed that her son not only put the washing into the washing machine but sometimes hung the clothes out on the Hills hoist and helped her in her movements around the house including helping her into and out of the bath. Assessing the credibility of the Plaintiff29 Assessing the credibility of a witness involves an assessment of two overlapping considerations, reliability and honesty.30 Attacks on the credibility of a witness can be made on a number of bases: 
     
      
      1. Where a prior inconsistent statement or document shows that a person has told a lie on an issue material to the case. There is a helpful discussion of this in  
      Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd 
       [2001] NSWSC 510 at 39 ff (under the heading “Admissions by Conduct”). An example in personal injury litigation would be a denial in the witness box of back injury prior to the accident, when medical records show this is not the case, or where there is film showing a plaintiff who can barely hobble into the witness box able to perform activities without difficulty. 
      
      
     
      
      2. A statement by a witness which is uncontradicted by other evidence but hard to explain. An example in personal injury litigation would be long delay in seeking medical attention, or failure to seek regular medical advice despite claims of being in severe pain. 
       
       
      3. Evidence which is not directly critical of the witness, but where there are competing versions from either side, either of the facts or of the interpretation of the facts. This commonly occurs in personal injury litigation in accounts of how the injury occurred and in the competing medical reports. The court has to decide which version of the evidence to accept. 
       
      
     4. Evidence that is not directly challenged by other witnesses or independent documentary evidence. 
     
      
    31 The written submissions of the plaintiff and defendant contained requests that I should accept the plaintiff as a witness of credit. A typical example was the statement by senior counsel for the plaintiff that “the plaintiff seeks a finding that the plaintiff was a truthful witness, and a finding that his evidence is to be preferred to the lay evidence given on behalf of the defendant …” and “the evidence of the plaintiff’s mother was not weakened in cross-examination, and should be accepted”. In addition, it was put to me that Dr Neophyton, who gave oral evidence, had given evidence that “was not weakened in cross-examination, and it should be accepted”. The Court of Appeal in a series of decisions commencing with Goodrich Aerospace v Arsic [2006] NSWCA 187 and most recently in the Premier Group v Lippis [2007] NSWCA 36 has stressed that (to quote Mason P in the Premier Group at [25]) findings as to demeanour are not the ""be all and end all"" and need to be tested against the probabilities and objective material. 32 This is difficult in personal injury cases for several reasons. The first is that a detailed analysis of the objective material is rarely undertaken by the medico-legal reports, and doctors frequently accept without question claims that the plaintiff suffers pain (or alternatively, state without giving proper reasons that the plaintiff ought not to be in pain at all). Rarely is it the case that doctors give the kind of careful analysis of the plaintiff’s prior medical history which enables an objective analysis as to whether the plaintiff has in fact suffered injury and, if so, if that injury is the result of the accident. Fortunately, as will become clear from an examination of the medical evidence, Dr Matheson has undertaken such an exercise.33 A second problem is that it is not uncommon, as in the present case, for the plaintiff not to be cross-examined upon the objective findings, with the result that the trial judge is left to make up his or her own mind without the benefit of hearing the plaintiff’s explanation for some particular form of conduct. In the present case, it is clear beyond doubt from Dr Youssef’s report that not only did he carry out an MRI which showed that the plaintiff’s results were normal but he shared with this good news with the plaintiff, as his report of 29 January 2004 states. Although the plaintiff was told this information, none of the doctors retained for the plaintiff or defendant were ever given this MRI and although the plaintiff must have known the result from his discussions with Dr Youssef, he never mentioned to any of his own doctors (except Dr Bleasel) that he ever saw Dr Youssef. 34 The difficulty I have is that if these questions had been put to the plaintiff, there could well have been an honest explanation for this. The plaintiff is a man of limited intelligence. He may not have understood what Dr Youssef was telling him, or he may not have accepted it. He may never have had the MRI in his possession and this may explain why although he took all other test results to doctors, he did not take this test result with him. 35 By reason of the failure of the defendant to appreciate the importance of this missing MRI and to ask the plaintiff questions about it, I am really not in any position at all to determine this or other issues that might be relevant to the plaintiff’s injuries. Accordingly, it is my view that I should make up my mind in relation to issues by paying as little regard as possible to demeanour. What little regard I pay to demeanour will err in the plaintiff’s favour, because I do propose to have regard to the fact that he is a person of limited intelligence and I can have regard to his demeanour in the witness box as being a very simple person unlikely to be capable of sustained dishonesty such as hiding MRI results from all the doctors. 36 The central issue for determination concerning quantum is whether to accept conflicting opinions of Dr Neophyton (for the plaintiff) or Dr Matheson (for the defendant) concerning the nature and extent of the plaintiff’s back problems. 37 Prior to considering this issue I should first carefully analyse all of the medical evidence tendered on behalf of the parties. The medical evidence38 It is common in personal injury claims for there to be widely differing views of the plaintiff’s condition in the medico-legal reports. One of the reasons for this is that although the contents of these reports comply with the requirements for experts’ reports set out in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705, medico-legal doctors prepare their reports without seeing some or all of the treating doctors’ records and investigations and the opposing party’s medico-legal reports. The medico-legal reports for both sides often merely accept (or reject) without analysis whether the plaintiff is honest and reliable in his account of his symptoms and in his presentation in the doctor’s rooms. The trial judge is left to reconcile the doctors’ differing opinions where some or all of the doctors have not been provided with the opposing party’s medico-legal reports or treating doctors’ investigations and where the submissions of the parties essentially are that the plaintiff is or is not a witness of credit. 39 The problem in the present case is that the plaintiff had an MRI scan on 14 January 2004 which was not shown to any of the doctors who provided written reports for either side. His treating specialist, Dr Youssef, wrote to the plaintiff’s treating doctor on 29 January 2004 saying: 
     
      
      “ There was no significant abnormality in the sacroiliac region that would explain his symptoms. In fact, I am pleased with the result and reassured [the plaintiff] that there is no significant musculoskeletal disorder. He is symptomatically much improved and was pleased with the results of the MRI scan.  
       
       
      I have recommended that he continue to mobilise. He does not require any further intervention from a musculoskeletal point of view.”  
       
      
    This letter was not shown to any of the doctors either.40 What the MRI did discover was that the plaintiff had a left pelvic kidney with dilated calyces and this was the reason for his problems. Dr Youssef arranged a follow up with a renal physician, Dr Eris, and gave no further treatment to the plaintiff. (The results of the ultrasound were essentially normal, according to the report of 2 February 2004). 41 Apart from having a second MRI performed at the request of Dr Dan on 15 June 2005 the plaintiff saw no other treating doctor. He only consulted his general practitioner, Dr Small. No patient cards or medico-legal reports (apart from the brief referral letters to Dr Youssef and Dr Dan) from Dr Small were tendered. According to Dr Matheson, an expert retained by the defendant, the plaintiff saw Dr Dan at the suggestion of a friend (the handwritten referral letter to Dr Dan from Dr Ravi, Dr Small’s partner at the medical centre, is illegible).42 The plaintiff attended a number of medico-legal appointments but he only took his second MRI with him. I have checked each of the doctors’ reports and none of them refer to the first MRI. Dr Neophyton in his evidence in court listed with care the reports he saw and he did not refer to this MRI, although he was shown it for the purpose of his evidence in court. The 14 January 2004 MRI was served on 17 November 2005 which was well after the plaintiff had seen the defendant’s medico-legal experts. The defendant did not send this document to any of its medico-legal experts for further comment. The report of Dr Youssef of 29 January was, however, included in the defendant’s bundle of medico-legal reports. 43 I shall first consider the treatment and diagnoses from the plaintiff’s treating doctors Hospital and treating doctors’ reports44 The plaintiff was taken by ambulance to Sydney Hospital and hospital records show that X-rays taken of his spine. The X-ray of the lumbosacral spine by Dr Roberts on 19 October was normal and he was allowed to go home.45 On 3 November 2003 the plaintiff appears to have gone to Sydney Hospital again, where he had a CT scan of his lumbar spine. This CT scan report is signed by Dr Bruce Roberts, the same doctor who prepared the 19 October report. He noted that while the L4/5 disc was normal, at L5/S1 “there is broad based disc bulging indenting the thecal sac and entering the lateral recesses bilaterally” and that there was “associated canal stenosis at this level.”46 The treating doctor the plaintiff also saw that day wrote a referral, addressed to “Dear Dr” (see the first report in the Exhibit A bundle), noting this CT scan showed a disc bulge and the notes at the bottom of his report appear to read: “PD Disc prolapse with L sided sciatica”. Following this the plaintiff saw his general practitioner, Dr Small, who wrote a referral to Dr Youssef inquiring whether the plaintiff had a missed fracture and whether he required further investigation.47 Dr Youssef referred the plaintiff for a bone scan on 1 December 2003. Dr Youssef in his report of 4 December 2003 noted that the appearances in the bone scan “are those of a fracture” and that he had organised for him to have a CT scan through this area “to confirm the diagnosis”. He also referred him for bone density, 25 hydroxy vitamin D, PTH and thyroid function tests and said he would review him again after the CT scan.48 Dr Youssef’s report of 12 December 2003 was that although the increased uptake in the left sacroiliac joint and the adjacent sacrum had been considered to be “most consistent with a recent fracture”, the CT was normal. Dr Youssef noted that if the problem was simply a fracture, then the symptoms should settle. He arranged an MRI scan to try to determine the cause of the increased uptake in these areas of the plaintiff’s body, as well as vitamin D levels, thyroid function and testosterone tests. He said he would review him after the MRI but that ‘[a]t the present moment I fee that the prognosis is good.”49 At about this time the plaintiff had two steroid injections from his general practitioner.50 The MRI report dated 14 January 2004 from Dr Thompson said there was no evidence to support the presence of an underlying fracture. The report did note: 
     
      
      “There is a small central disc herniation at L5/S1 and there is a little lateral recess narrowing bilaterally, without evidence of nerve root impingement. There is a slight narrowing of the lateral foraminae bilaterally, without evidence of nerve root impingement.” 
       
      
    51 This MRI report is the report not referred to in any of the medico-legal reports and as previously stated it is quite clear that all doctors not only never saw this first MRI but never saw Dr Youssef’s report either. Dr Harvey referred only to the MRI scan of 14 June 2005 and noted that it showed no evidence of any compression of the 1st sacral nerve root. Dr Matheson also only saw the second MRI but still considered there was no encroachment on neural structures, Dr Neophyton’s report of September 7, 2004 lists the documents he was provided with and this MRI is not amongst those documents; his interpretation of the 2005 MRI was, however, very different from that of Dr Matheson. Dr Stenning, Dr Matalani, Dr Mahony, Dr Bleasel and Dr Kendall do not refer to it. It would appear that Dr Dan did not know about this earlier MRI either, because he does not refer to it in either of his reports of 9 June 2005 (when he says the plaintiff should have an MRI) and his report of 11 July 2005 (when he discusses the results).52 The plaintiff had some physiotherapy at the suggestion of Dr Youssef. According to Dr Harvey (report dated 19 July 2005) he saw a Dr Valkoni at the request of his own solicitors. Dr Valkoni was, however, described as a treating doctor by Dr Stenning in his report of 20 April 2004 (no reference is made to Dr Youssef). Whoever Dr Valkoni is, no report was tendered to the court. 53 In June 2005 he consulted Dr Dan and had the X-ray and MRI scan referred to above but has had no other treatment apart from regular prescription of painkillers.54 This outline of the plaintiff’s medical evidence identifies a number of problems: 
     
      
      (a) The reports from the plaintiff’s treating specialist, Dr Youssef, only cover the three months after the accident, and he considers the plaintiff to have recovered.  
       
       
      (b) Dr Youssef’s 29 January 2004 report and Dr Thompson’s MRI are not provided to any doctors retained by either the plaintiff or the defendant’s solicitors. 
       
       
      (c) There is no report from the plaintiff’s general practitioner (although he is the only treating doctor to have seen him since, or on a regular basis). 
      
     
     
      
      (d) There is no medical evidence (eg notes from the general practitioner or from the physiotherapist) about what other ongoing medical treatment the plaintiff had, including any treatment from Dr Valkoni. 
      
     
     
      
      (e) There is no information in the treating reports to explain the difference between the first and second MRI.  
       
      
    The plaintiff’s medico-legal reports55 The plaintiff was sent to Drs Stenning, Kendall, Legg, Neophyton, Mahony, Bleasel and Matalani for the purpose of medico-legal reports.Dr Stenning56 Dr Stenning saw the plaintiff on 2 April 2004. He noted that the X-ray of 19 October 2003 was normal and that the CAT scan on 3 November 2003 indicated L5/S1 bulging with associated canal stenosis but did not have the follow up tests ordered by Dr Youssef or Dr Youssef’s reports. He thought the plaintiff’s specialist was Dr Peter Valkoni. He diagnosed the plaintiff as suffering from chronic soft tissue damage, chronic pain state and a discogenic lesion. He considered the plaintiff needed to see an orthopaedic surgeon on a regular basis but made no other recommendations. His conclusions are based on incomplete information and are of little assistance.Dr Kendall57 Dr Kendall saw the plaintiff on 11 August 2004. He noted that the plaintiff showed him the X-rays and the CT scan and said he agreed with what this report said, namely that there was “an L5/S1 impingement”. He noted the reference in the nuclear scan of 1 December 2003 to the possibility of a recent fracture injury but does not record the result of the CT scan that “no fractures are identified.” In fact, he goes on to assert, on page 4, that the nuclear scan evidence shows “evidence of recent fracture” and that “the L5/S1 disc lesion and sacroiliac fracture must have been caused by his fall.” 58 Dr Kendall makes no comment about Dr Youssef’s conclusion in his letter of 12 December 2003 that even if this is a fracture, his symptoms should settle, that an MRI has been ordered and that even with this diagnosis “the prognosis is good”. However, perhaps he was not shown this document. I do not have any way of knowing, since Dr Kendall did not list the documents he was given.59 Dr Kendall has made an incorrect diagnosis because he was not given all the reports and tests of Dr Youssef. His report is of little assistance. His recommendations for further treatment (physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and exercise) are criticised by Dr Matheson.Mr C Legg60 Mr Legg is a psychologist who saw the plaintiff on 17 August 2004. The only medical report he was given was Dr Stenning’s report. He notes that the plaintiff was told by “the specialist” had he “had a slight fracture” (p.2) and that he stopped going to physiotherapy after two sessions because it increased his pain and he found it difficult to get to the appointments. He diagnosed the plaintiff as suffering with Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood and recommended 20 counselling sessions and attendance at the pain management clinic.61 Mr Legg accepted the plaintiff’s claims of pain without analysis. This must substantially undermine the value of his conclusions that the plaintiff’s problems arose from the pain he was suffering as a result of the accident. By comparison, Dr Revai (for the defendant) analysed these matters in detail.Dr Neophyton62 Dr Neophyton prepared a report dated 7 September 2004 and gave evidence. He is the doctor principally relied upon by the plaintiff.63 Dr Neophyton lists the documents he saw as the report of Dr Stenning of 2 April 2004, the X-ray (which was normal) and the CT scan of 3 November 2003. He also refers elsewhere in his report to the bone scan of 1 December with the provisional diagnosis of a fracture and the 11 December CT scan which was normal. He describes the plaintiff’s medical history as being a referral to Dr Valkoni, who he says organised the 3 November 2003 scan. 64 Based on these reports, Dr Neophyton says that the plaintiff’s condition will not improve “until such time as [the plaintiff] has surgery to his back.” He goes on to add: 
     
      
      “Because the problems with his back have only been present for 10 months it is quite likely that Mr Hurcum’s orthopaedic specialist is waiting to see whether or not there is a chance he will make some kind of recovery without having to resort to surgery.”  
       
      
    65 Dr Neophyton went on to say that it was probable the plaintiff would need surgery to his lower back in the form of a laminectomy and a possible spinal fusion, at a cost or about $50,000. He repeats his conclusion that “until such time as Mr Hurcum has surgery he will not make a good recovery” on the last page of his report.66 Dr Neophyton’s medical opinion is expressed as being based upon the plaintiff’s history, examination and X-ray findings.67 Although Dr Neophyton in his evidence said that an MRI was better evidence than a CT scan, and that this was why the 2005 MRI was such an important diagnostic tool, he made no reference to any need for one in his report. More importantly, it was clear from his evidence in the witness box, when he listed the documentation he was given to prepare his report, that he never saw the first MRI report or the reports of Dr Youssef before preparing it. He was shown this MRI (but not the reports of Dr Youssef) for the first time on the day he gave evidence. 68 Dr Neophyton said the following when asked if the two MRI and CTs caused him to change his opinion. He had previously seen the CT scans but not the MRIs and said:  
     
      
      “ Well, I won’t change my opinion, only because I do not base an opinion purely on an X-ray report. It does, however, if I take it in connection with his progress over the last two years since I saw him, if there has been improvement. I would be inclined to suggest that the MRI scan has a lot more weight. In fact, I do believe that an MRI scan has more weight than a CT scan in making an opinion. For that reason I must conclude perhaps that I will vary my opinion, but only dependent on the patient’s current symptomatology.” 
       
      
    69 This is the closest Dr Neophyton ever gets to referring to the 14 January 2004 MRI. What he appears to be saying is that while he might be prepared to vary his opinion if the 2004 MRI says what it does, any variation is dependent on the plaintiff’s description of his symptoms. Thus if the patient says he is in pain, the fact that the 2004 MRI says there is no nerve impingement makes no difference.70 Dr Neophyton was not cross-examined about the first MRI, the significance of which did not appear to have leapt out at the defendant. He was, however, cross-examined about the differences between his opinion and the opinion of Dr Matheson. His answers clearly demonstrate the level of discomfort he felt about this. Dr Neophyton praised Dr Matheson in glowing terms, saying that if he had a patient with a difficult neurosurgical problem he would refer that patient to Dr Matheson. This was not however an answer to the question. As Dr Neophyton conceded, not only did Dr Matheson have the advantage of seeing the patient almost a year after Dr Neophyton had seen him, but he had available to him the second MRI scan of the plaintiff’s lumbar spine on 14 June 2005. Dr Neophyton agreed that this was a better diagnostic tool than the CT scan Dr Neophyton had seen. Dr Neopyhton said that there must have been improvement in the plaintiff’s lumbar spine problem. Dr Neophyton’s evidence does not really deal with the first MRI, which shows that there are no problems. 71 Dr Neophyton was effectively conceding that Dr Matheson was in a better position to assess the plaintiff. Dr Mahony72 Dr Mahony saw the plaintiff on 11 November 2004. He was told the plaintiff had not yet had physiotherapy or other active treatment apart from a cortisone injection from Dr Small and prescriptions for Tramal. Again, he thought the plaintiff had also been referred to a doctor named “Dr Peter Valconey”. 73 Dr Mahoney had the X-ray of 19 October, the bone scan of 1 December, the CT scan of the lumbar spine of 3 November 2003 and the CT scan of the sacroiliac joints of 11 December 2003. Helpfully, he has attached these three documents to his report, and it can be seen that he did not receive any of the reports of Dr Youssef.74 He diagnosed lumbosacral disc lesion and coccydynia and recommended physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and wearing a lumbar support. The cost is $17,000.Dr Bleasel75 Dr Bleasel saw the plaintiff on 30 November 2004. Dr Bleasel noted that the plaintiff told him his “main adviser has been Dr Peter Youssef and he plans to go back to see him again because he is not happy with his lack of progress” (p. 2). Dr Bleasel then sets out excerpts from the bone scan of 1 December and the CT scans of 3 November and 11 December 2003. He does not refer to the MRI or to Dr Youssef’s reports and he clearly was not shown these by the plaintiff, although it is clear from Dr Youssef’s report that he showed the MRI result to the plaintiff, whom he described as being happy at the good news.76 Dr Bleasel concludes that the plaintiff suffered musculoligamentous injury and probable disc damage at the lumbosacral area and a probable strain in the sacroiliac joints, and muscular pain around the left shoulder blade. He notes the plaintiff “is planning to see Dr Youssef and it is likely that further physiotherapy will be tried”, adding “I do not believe that surgery will be recommended.”Dr Matalani77 Dr Matalani saw the plaintiff on 4 July 2005. In addition to the two CT scans of 3 November and 11 November 2003, the X-ray taken the day of the accident and the bone scan of 1 December 2003, he was given the MRI scan of 15 June 2005. He and Dr Dan are the only doctors who provide written reports for the plaintiff referring to this second MRI scan. He considered the plaintiff suffered from soft tissue injury and chronic musculoligamentous strain of the back on a background of discogenic lesions and symptoms consistent with nerve root irritation affecting the left leg. He recommended conservative treatment such as physiotherapy, pain counselling and intensive rehabilitation. Should his symptoms persist, a possible course would be a laminectomy which would cost $15,000 - $20,000. Professor Dan78 Professor Noel Dan saw the plaintiff in June and July 2005 and ordered the second MRI. He noted the plaintiff had ongoing lower lumbar pain with left partial sciatica and that some of the toes tingle and others were numb. He dragged the left foot and had worsened in the past year. He noted that the test results were normal, although the pinprick test was dull. The lumbar CT was “unremarkable” and the CT showed no abnormality. Because the plaintiff was complaining about worsening he recommended further X-rays and a lumbar MRI. 79 Professor Dan’s report of 11 July 2005 showed a bulge that he considered was not surgically manageable. As I indicate further below, I have accepted the explanation of Dr Matheson for this bulge.80 Professor Dan must have been unaware that the plaintiff had a prior MRI. He had no prior history of the plaintiff having treatment from Dr Youssef or Dr Youssef’s encouraging reports. When seen in the context of the analysis of Dr Matheson, Professor Dan’s reports cannot take the matter further.The defendant’s medico-legal expertsDr Revai81 Dr Revai is a psychiatrist who examined the plaintiff on 23 May 2005. He described the plaintiff as a thirty year old single man who had hardly ever worked since leaving school. He noted he was illiterate and for the past seven years had been on a carer’s pension looking after his mother, which he had remained on since the accident. He noted the plaintiff’s treatment as being merely to take analgesics and that he had never had physiotherapy. He did obtain a history that the plaintiff’s GP referred him to Dr Youssef, who ordered further X-rays, “but according to Mr Hurcum, did not order any treatment”. On direct questioning Mr Hurcum said he could not afford to have physiotherapy treatment.82 Dr Revai said that while the plaintiff “led me to believe that since that time Dr Small has prescribed Tramal SR150MG twice a day, which Mr Hurcum still takes” he concluded that the plaintiff “just takes analgesics”.83 He was not satisfied that the plaintiff suffered from a psychiatric disturbance as a consequence of the fall. He did not consider he required any treatment or that from psychiatric viewpoint he was unfit to carry out any occupation. Dr Harvey84 Dr Harvey also ascertained that the plaintiff was seen by Dr Peter Youssef on referral by Dr Small and noted that Dr Youssef saw him on four occasions “but he didn’t institute any further treatment”. He said the plaintiff told him that he “does still try to do as much as he can in the house” including cooking his mother’s meals, putting things in the washing machine, doing some cleaning and mopping and sometimes hanging the washing out. The plaintiff said his brother always did the shopping before his accident because his brother had a car. This history was dictated in front of the plaintiff and verified by him as correct (page 3 of the report of 19 July 2005). 85 Dr Harvey carefully noted all of the plaintiff’s complaints of pain and looked at the X-ray and the second (but not the first) MRI. He diagnosed the plaintiff as having suffered a soft tissue injury to the lower back. He noted that prior to the accident the plaintiff was caring for his invalid mother “and apparently he is still doing much of this work although he says he has difficulty with the heavier tasks”. Dr Harvey considered it would be consistent that he would have difficulty with heavier tasks which involved much bending or heavier lifting. He considered the continuing use of Tramadol which was a potentially habituating medication, to be inappropriate and recommended that he should take simpler analgesics. 86 Dr Harvey also noted that the MRI scan showed no evidence of any compression of the first sacral nerve root and there is other evidence of such compression. The plaintiff had quite a brisk left ankle jerk and normal power in the muscles in the foot and ankle. He commented that there were “some features which would suggest a non-organic component”, a polite way of saying that the plaintiff is exaggerating. Dr Harvey noted that the pain on straight leg raising was not relieved by knee flexion and that “one does not normally expect hip flexion to cause low back pain”. He also noted that the straight leg raising and hip flexion was not consistently restricted, as could be demonstrated by asking the patient to sit up on the couch. In other words, the plaintiff’s symptoms were inconsistent, which is an indication of exaggeration. He also dismissed the question of whether there was any problem in the left sacroiliac joint, noting that this had been “clearly excluded by the normal CT scan”. He considered that the plaintiff had at best a 5% whole person impairment. Dr Matheson87 Dr Matheson, like Dr Revai and Dr Harvey, obtained a correct history of the plaintiff’s treatment following the accident. He noted that the plaintiff consulted his GP Dr Small but that no treatment followed apart from a referral to Dr Youssef who organised some tests and put him through two courses of physiotherapy which the plaintiff discontinued because he felt it made him worse. He was not given the first MRI, but he saw the second MRI.88 Dr Matheson helpfully comments on the reports of the plaintiff’s doctors, and although the comments concerning Dr Neophyton, Dr Mahony and Dr Bleasel are brief, there is an extensive analysis of the report of Dr Matalani. He describes Dr Matalini’s opinion as “a studied opinion”. He notes that Dr Matalani’s diagnosis as a soft tissue injury and muscular ligamentous strain is the same as his own and that his disagreement with Dr Matalani’s report relates to what he calls “outcome” not the medical problem. He notes that even by Dr Matalani’s own reporting the “outcome” (i.e. the opinion as to the plaintiff’s disability) is due to his underlying degenerative condition and not to the strain that he sustained on 19 October 2003. 89 Dr Matheson had the following to say about the plaintiff:  
     
      
      “He has a fairly typical situation of incorporation of L5 into the sacrum and the beginnings of some early degenerative changes in the disc above. This disc takes more work because of the congenital fusion and these people commonly get some disc degeneration above this transitional level. This can be a source of benign back pain. It can not possibly cause any sciatica. The fall he had could have produced some buttock pain at the time but would not have worsened his condition which is congenital and not cause any persisting problems over a long term. Mr Hurcum shows some clear inconsistent features such as his straight leg raising and is obviously exaggerating such disability that he has. Finally, he may have some intermittent disability but it has nothing to do with the incident of the 19th October 2003. This accident produced no additional damage and did not make him any worse. Any effects of the incident of the 19th October 2003 have long since ceased. His current symptoms can not be attributed to that incident. His capacity for work is unchanged as to prior to this event”. 
       
      
    90 Dr Matheson has objectively analysed the plaintiff’s medical history. He has picked up on the fact that Dr Youssef gave up on the fact that Dr Youssef gave no further treatment. Although Dr Matheson did not know about the MRI, he was able to correctly deduce the advice Dr Youssef gave. This is significant.91 The second significant advantage Dr Matheson has is his ability to assess and comment upon the reports of the plaintiff’s specialists. Unlike Dr Neoplyton, he saw and commented upon the second MRI and I prefer Dr Matheson’s explanation of what this MRI means, not least because his explanation in the only logical way to explain the normal results of the first MRI.Dr Youssef92 The defendant served the report of Dr Youssef of 29 January 2004 concerning the first MRI. I have summarised the contents of this document elsewhere in this judgment.Conclusions concerning the defendant’s medical reports93 Each of the defendant’s doctors has carefully analysed the plaintiff’s medical history and has noted not only the fact that he consulted Dr Youssef but also they have been able to infer from the treatment history and a careful analysis of the plaintiff’s inconsistent claims of pain that the plaintiff had not suffered injuries requiring treatment.94 The defendant’s medical reports are to be preferred because by taking a careful history of the plaintiff’s medical treatment and by giving due and proper weight to the test results, as opposed to uncritically accepting complaints by the plaintiff of pain, they are in a better position to provide an objective analysis and to fulfil their role as experts whose first duty is to report accurately on the plaintiff’s medical condition and to do so by way of an independent assessment.95 I have set out a summary of each of the medical reports tendered by both sides so as to illustrate the problem of reconciling the very different medical reports. Each of the reports tendered by the plaintiff sets out a description of the plaintiff’s complaints of pain without any objective analysis of the plaintiff’s prior medical history. Where there is a gap in the information, or a matter that should have put a doctor preparing a report on notice, or even an MRI scan that appears to show the plaintiff has not suffered any injury, that makes little or no difference because what matters to these doctors is what Dr Neophyton called “the patient’s current symptomatology”. In other words, there is an uncritical acceptance of the plaintiff’s complaints of pain rather than an objective analysis of the patient’s history.96 A somewhat factually similar situation occurred in The Nominal Defendant v Kostic [2007] NSWCA 14. In order to resolve a dispute between the plaintiff’s and defendant’s medico-legal experts, the judge had to determine a number of factual issues, notably the date on which the plaintiff first experienced lower back pain, the degree and extent, the progress of the pain, when it was first reported to a medical practitioner and what subsequent treatment she had. The trial judge in those proceedings rejected the opinion of the defendant’s expert although the defendant’s expert did identify some objective facts on which the plaintiff’s claims of pain could be identified.97 While I note the comments of the Court of Appeal concerning the obligation of judges to determine these issues, the same could be said concerning the doctors who provide reports for the purpose of these proceedings. As the above summary of reports shows, Dr Matheson immediately picked up on the unusual circumstances of the plaintiff having only brief treatment from Dr Youssef and thereafter having no further treatment. The plaintiff’s own treating doctors appear to have made only superficial enquiries about what kind of treatment the plaintiff had and to have uncritically accepted the plaintiff’s statements that he was in pain.98 It is the prime duty of experts in giving opinion evidence to furnish the trier of fact with criteria enabling evaluation of the validity of the experts’ conclusions (at 729). Many of these medical reports suffer from the same defects as the report referred to in Steffen v Ruban [1966] 2 NSWR 622 where Jacobs JA described the report as “a confusion of observation, statement and opinion given with little precision but much lack of consistency”. Heydon JA set out this extract in Makita at 733 before noting the observations of Lawton LJ in R v Turner [1975] QB834 at 840: 
     
      
      “If the expert has been misinformed about the fact or has taken irrelevant facts into consideration or has omitted to consider relevant ones, the opinion is likely to be valueless.” 
       
      
    99 Heydon JA notes the importance which the law attaches to identification of the assumed facts by looking not merely at the expertise of the expert witness but to examine the substance of the opinion. In cases where experts differ, the lay tribunal must apply “logic and common sense” to the best of its ability in deciding which view is to be preferred or which parts of the evidence are to be accepted. Heydon JA notes that the substance of an opinion therefore depends upon “the essential integers underlying it” (at 735). The absence of such evidence deprives the court of an important opportunity of testing the validity of the process by which the opinion was formed. 100 In Makita at 739-740, Heydon JA sets out seven obligations that experts have to the court. The first two of these relate to the need for expert reports to be the independent report of an expert uninfluenced by the exigencies of litigation and that the experts should provide independent assistance to the court by way of an objective unbiased opinion.101 Fundamentally, expert evidence is no better than the facts on which it is based. If it is based on an uncritical acceptance by the medical expert that the plaintiff is in pain, then the reasoning process which must be exposed as part of the report is simply never gone into. Just as it is unacceptable for a judgment to be based upon an unexplained acceptance of a plaintiff, doctors, including medico-legal experts retained for plaintiffs, ought to consider in an objective and fair fashion, the plaintiff’s history of medical treatment as well as his complaints of pain. Doctors are rarely cross-examined, so if they do not provide some kind of objective analysis of the plaintiff’s medical history, the trial judge is faced with a series of reports which do little more than uncritically accept the plaintiff as suffering from pain. 102 All that was called for in the present case was the kind of analysis that Dr Matheson has done, namely to obtain an accurate account of the plaintiff’s treatment following his injury. The plaintiff clearly knew the result of his MRI from Dr Youssef because Dr Youssef told him about it. The circumstances in which the plaintiff saw Dr Youssef only a few times and thereafter had no further treatment from him was something that put Dr Matheson on notice. It should, with respect, have put the plaintiff’s doctors on notice as well. If they had been treating the plaintiff as a patient, rather than providing a medico-legal report, they would make such an enquiry, because it would be an important tool in diagnosing the plaintiff’s medical problems to know what previous treatment he had received. 103 Accordingly, it is my view that I should accept the opinion of Dr Matheson and the medical experts retained for the defendant rather than the opinion of Dr Neophyton.104 However, I should also consider the issue of whether in his accounts of pain and suffering the plaintiff is able to persuade me that notwithstanding the opinions expressed by Dr Matheson, which I have indicated that I prefer, he is suffering from pain and restriction of movement of the kind that he gave evidence about. This requires me to determine the credibility of the plaintiff as a witness. 105 I have set out above my reasons for rejecting the claim brought on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff’s fall was fraudulently contrived. However, in considering an assessment of the damages I should have regard not only to Dr Matheson’s diagnosis but also to the plaintiff’s symptomatology. This is particularly the case in relation to a plaintiff who is very much at the lower end of the normal scale of intelligence and whose coping mechanisms are the subject of psychological and psychiatric assessment.General Damages106 As the Statement of Claim was filed on 30 June 2005 the action is subject to the Civil Liability Act 2002. 107 The plaintiff was born on 30 May 1975 and is currently 31 years of age. He will turn 65 in 33 years. His life expectancy on the 2004 life tables is 47.5 years. 108 The plaintiff claims non-economic loss between 30% and 32% ($98,000.00 to $128,000.00).109 I have accepted the medical evidence of the defendant and I am satisfied that while the plaintiff has some soft tissue injuries and suffered some distress from the fall, particularly by reason of his limited intellectual capacity, his non-economic loss would not be assessed at greater than 15% of the most extreme case. I am satisfied that he recovered and that any ongoing back problems he has are a combination of his congenital condition (which I find was in no way worsened or added to by the fall, for the reasons explained by Dr Matheson), his emotional response to the accident (as recorded by Dr Harvey) and, if he is taking Tramal, by taking inappropriate medication, and I accept Dr Harvey’s comments in this regard. I do not accept that he suffers any psychiatric problems and I prefer the diagnosis of Dr Revai for the reasons stated more fully above.110 I accordingly assess the plaintiff’s non-economic loss as nil.Out-of-pocket expenses111 Past out-of-pocket expenses have been agreed as $2,518.50 as at the date of trial.112 Future out of pocket expenses of $38,480.00 are claimed by the plaintiff. This is to allow for $50,000.00 for future operative care postponed for ten years ($30,700.00) plus an allowance for ongoing care, specialist review and medication.113 The submission to me is that the plaintiff, still a young man, may suffer some exacerbation of his injuries and that there is a high probability that ultimately he will require surgery. It is submitted that the risk that he will suffer exacerbation and require surgery is sufficient to justify an award of damages.114 I am satisfied that the plaintiff has suffered a musculoligamentous injury from which he has recovered. He does not require surgery. He does not in my view require heavy medication for pain either.115 I am prepared to allow a small buffer because I am of the view that the plaintiff may require some ongoing review by his general practitioner, including some form of counselling or other treatment, particularly if there is a risk that he has become habituated to Tramal. I have no information as to what kind of treatment he is having apart from his own evidence, but if as a result of the fall he has been complaining of pain and has been over-medicated then this is a matter which is connected to the plaintiff’s fall. I have particular regard to the plaintiff’s limited reasoning ability in this regard; if he was prescribed medication which is inappropriate, he would not be in any position to assess this in any independent fashion. Accordingly, I am prepared to allow a small buffer for ongoing visits to Dr Small and any other counselling or assistance he may need in this regard. I propose to allow the sum of $2,000.00.Gratuitous and paid care116 No claim is made under this head.Past and future economic loss117 The plaintiff continued to receive his pension as a carer for his mother. A claim is made for loss of opportunity to work.118 A claim is made for $50,000.00 for loss of opportunity to work to the date of the trial and past and economic loss of $128,000.00 is claimed. The average weekly earning of all males in New South Wales as at 19 May 2006 was $996.80 per week (gross). Bearing in mind that the plaintiff has effectively never worked, the plaintiff’s senior counsel has suggested reduced income of $500.00 per week net which is $26,100.00 per annum net. Accordingly the amount claimed represents less than two year’s earning.119 It is submitted that the plaintiff has effectively lost the opportunity to work because the impact of such an injury on a person of low intellect who is illiterate who would at best be able to perform a labouring type job means that even this kind of simple employment would be denied him. He has lost the chance of obtaining such work: Rufo v Hosking (2004) 61 NSWLR 678. 120 The plaintiff gave evidence that he was looking for work prior to his injury and therefore the loss of a chance in this case was the loss of “a very substantial chance” (State of New South Wales v Burton [2006] NSWCA 12 at [93]).121 Section 13 Civil Liability Act 2002 provides as follows: 
     
      
      Future economic loss – claimant’s prospects and adjustments 
      (1) A court cannot make an award of damages for future economic loss unless the claimant first satisfies the court that the assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award is to be based accord with the claimant’s most likely future circumstances but for the injury. 
      (2) When a court determines the amount of any such award of damages for future economic loss it is required to adjust the amount of damages for future economic loss that would have been sustained on those assumptions by reference to the percentage possibility that the events might have occurred but for the injury. 
      (3) If the court makes an award for future economic loss, it is required to state the assumptions on which the award was based and the relevant percentage by which damages were adjusted. 
      
    122 In Penrith City Council v Parks [2004] NSWCA 201 Giles JA noted that the meaning and effect of Section 13 was “most obscure” (at [2]) but that fundamentally a claim in its entitlement to damages for future economic loss, in concept or loss of earning capacity, involves a comparison between the economic benefit to the claimant from exercising earning capacity before injury to earning capacity after injury. The purpose of Section 13 is to confine claims for future economic loss to those claims which fall within the ambit of Section 13. The correct method to follow when determining an appropriate award for future economic loss was outlined by McClellan A-JA Parks at [51] as being the following: 
     
      
      (a) The court must determine the most likely future circumstances of a claimant but for the injury, which requires the court to assess matters such as the prospects of a claimant gaining or remaining in employment, for what period, and the rate at which he or she may earn during that employment; 
      (b) The court must make an adjustment to any such award by reference to the percentage possibility that the events might have occurred but for the injury; and 
      (c) The assumption and the percentage must be stated. 
      
    123 I have found that the plaintiff recovered relatively quickly from those injuries he suffered in the accident. I have accepted the views expressed by Dr Matheson concerning the injuries he suffered in the accident. I have accepted the views expressed by Dr Matheson concerning not only the plaintiff’s past but also his future economic loss. 124 The plaintiff’s prior work history is effectively non-existent. While I am prepared to accept he may have given consideration to looking for some work prior to the accident, he failed to find any. Clearly his ability to work is something that would be dependant upon any such work fitting in with his duties caring for his mother. There is no evidence to suggest that this situation would change. In the immediate future he is likely to continue to be his mother’s carer. Consequently, I do not accept that the plaintiff has lost any chance, let alone a very substantial chance, of future employment. Quite apart from the fact that he has recovered from his injuries his intention in the past and in the future for some considerable time will be to continue to care for his mother. Even if the plaintiff’s injuries were more serious, he would have difficulty satisfying me pursuant to Section 13 that he has suffered any compensable future economic loss. However, as I have found that he has in fact completely recovered from his injuries and is fit for work, he has suffered no compensable loss and I accordingly make no award.Orders125 Before making orders in relation to the plaintiff’s entitlement, I should first note that a very considerable part of the hearing before me was taken up with cross-examination of the plaintiff’s witnesses concerning the circumstances of the plaintiff’s fall. I note that a prior hearing date was vacated by reason of the calling of this evidence. The defendant’s case on this issue was a very weak one. This may be relevant in relation to any arguments concerning costs.126 I have awarded nil for non-economic loss and for economic loss. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s sole entitlement is to past and future out-of-pocket expenses which total $2,518.00 (agreed past out-of-pockets) and $2,000.00 (buffer for future out-of-pocket expenses). 127 Accordingly, the orders to be made are: 
     
      
      1. Judgment for the plaintiff for $4,518.00. 
       
      2. Defendant pay plaintiff’s costs. 
       
      3. Liberty to restore in relation to order 2. 
       
      4. Exhibits retained for 28 days.

    JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: As to the appeal of Stephen Michael Larkin:1. The appellant, Stephen Michael Larkin, was summonsed, pursuant to s 596A of the Corporations Act (Commonwealth), to appear before the Deputy Registrar of the Equity Division of the Supreme Court on 14 March 2002 for examination about the affairs of Actwane Pty Ltd. He did not appear upon that day and he was ordered to appear on 15 March 2002. 2. At 7.35 am on 15 March 2002 the appellant left premises at Edgecliff where he had stayed the night. Unbeknown to him, he was under surveillance from when he left the premises at Edgecliff until 2.55 pm that day when he entered the Supreme Court Building in Queen's Square in Sydney. 3. At 4 pm on 15 March 2002 the appellant appeared before Deputy Registrar Wearne to be examined. 4. The examination commenced at 4.05 pm and concluded at about 5 pm. After he had been sworn in, the Deputy Registrar asked the appellant for his name, address and occupation and the appellant replied, giving his name, address and occupation. Then the Deputy Registrar told the appellant the purpose of the examination, that he was required to answer the questions asked of him and that, if he wished to claim privilege in respect of any answer that he gave, he had to say the word ""privilege"" before the answer. Then the Deputy Registrar asked him if he understood what he had been told and the appellant replied that he understood what he had been told. Then Mr Braham of counsel examined the appellant.5. During the course of his examination Mr Braham asked the appellant 236 questions and the appellant responded to each of them. 6. Therefore, during the hour from 4.05 pm to about 5 pm the appellant responded to 238 questions; two asked by the Deputy Registrar and 236 asked by Mr Braham. 7. Of the 236 questions asked by Mr Braham, the appellant prefaced the answer to 199 of them with the word ""privilege"", He used the word ""privilege"" in his answer to 11 of them, and he did not preface his answer with the word ""privilege"" or use the word ""privilege"" in his answer to 28 of them. 8. Of the 28 questions asked by Mr Braham to which the appellant did not preface his answer with the word ""privilege"" or in which he did not use the word ""privilege"" in his answer, the first 15 of such questions were the second to the 16th asked by Mr Braham. These questions related to the appellant's movements during the morning of the day, which movements were known to Mr Braham because, as I have said already, the appellant had been under surveillance from when he left the premises at Edgecliff to when he entered the Supreme Court Building. 9. Mr Braham asked the following questions and the appellant gave the following answers:  
     
      
      “Q. If you don't understand or hear any question of mine, please let me know and I will repeat it. Doctor Larkin, could you describe, please, your movements today? 
      
     
     
      
      A. My movements today? 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Yes, where have you been today? 
      
     
     
      
      A. I spent some time with Stewart Levitt, solicitor, this morning, returned to Kurrajong and returned here this afternoon. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Where did you start the day? You didn't wake up in Mr Levitt's office, did you?

      A. No."" 
      
    10. The appellant's answers to some of these questions were false. 11. The appellant's movements during the day were; (1) at 7.15 am he left the premises at Edgecliff and he drove his car to the city; (2) about 8.30 am he entered the building in York Street in which the solicitor had his office; (3) about 9.10 am he left the building in York Street and drove to the Skybar in Redfern; (4) at 10.22 am he left the Skybar and drove his car to an Office works shop in Alexandria; (5) at some time thereafter he left the Officeworks shop and drove his car back to the Skybar, arriving there at 11.24 am; (6) at 12.34 pm he left the Skybar to drive his car to Kinko's in Liverpool Street in the city; (7) he left Kinko's at 1.04 pm and drove back to the Skybar; (8) he left the Skybar at 2.02 pm and returned to Kinko's in Liverpool Street, leaving Kinko's shortly afterwards; (9) he entered the Supreme Court Building at 2.55 pm. 12. On 1 March 2003 the appellant was charged with, on 15 March, 2002, making a false statement while on oath, knowing the statement to be false, that statement not amounting to perjury, contrary to s 330 of the Crimes Act. This is an offence which carries a prescribed penalty of imprisonment for a maximum of 5 years when dealt with on indictment or imprisonment of 2 years if dealt with summarily. 13. In due course, on 24 September 2003 a magistrate in the Local Court in the Downing Centre in Sydney fixed 14 November 2003 for the hearing of the charge. 14. On 24 November 2003 the appellant appeared before Magistrate Fleming (as she then was) in the Local Court in the Downing Centre in Sydney for the hearing of the charge. Mr S. Littlemore, QC, instructed by Mr J. Bettens, solicitor, appeared for the appellant. Mr Littlemore applied to Magistrate Fleming to either quash the information upon which the charge was based or permanently stay the prosecution of the charge. After hearing submissions Magistrate Fleming invited the prosecutor, a solicitor of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and Mr Littlemore to provide written submissions on the appellant's applications and she stood over the hearing to 13 February 2004. 15. Accordingly, on about 9 December 2003 Magistrate Fleming received Mr Littlemore's submissions and on about 16 December 2003 she received the prosecutor's submissions. 16. On 13 February 2004 Magistrate Fleming gave her judgment on the appellant's applications, dismissing both of them and she fixed 14 May 2004 for the hearing of the charge. 17. On 14 May 2004 the appellant appeared again before Magistrate Fleming in the Local Court in the Downing Centre in Sydney for the hearing of the charge. Mr Bettens, solicitor, appeared for the appellant. Mr Bettens applied to Magistrate Fleming that she deal with the appellant pursuant to the provisions of s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. After hearing evidence from Dr T O Clarke, psychiatrist, and submissions from Mr Bettens, Magistrate Fleming declined to deal with the appellant pursuant to that Act and fixed 22 July 2004 for the hearing of the charge. 18. In the course of time, on 10 September 2004 the appellant appeared before Magistrate O'Shane in the Local Court in the Downing Centre in Sydney for the hearing of the charge. Mr Wendler, of counsel, instructed by Mr Bettens, appeared for the appellant. The prosecutor tendered a Statement of Agreed Facts, a transcript of the evidence given before the Deputy Registrar on 15 March 2002, two reports of Dr T O Clark, one dated 19 November 2003 and the other dated 14 April 2004 and a report of Dr C L Wong dated 27 April 2004, all of which were admitted into evidence. Then the prosecutor called Dr Wong to give evidence and he was examined by the prosecutor and cross-examined by Mr Wendler. Then the hearing was stood over to 18 February, 2005.19. On 18 February 2005 the appellant appeared again before Magistrate O'Shane. Unfortunately, Mr Bettens sought and was granted leave to withdraw from representing the appellant. Thereafter, with the appellant without legal representation, the cross-examination of Dr Wong concluded, after which the proceedings were stood over to 24 February 2005 for judgment. 20. On 24 February 2005 Magistrate O'Shane delivered her judgment. She found the offence to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and she stood over the proceedings to 10 March 2005 for the sentencing of the appellant.21. On 10 March 2005 Magistrate O'Shane convicted the appellant of the offence and she sentenced him to imprisonment for a period of 18 months, with a non-parole period of 12 periods and a parole period of 6 months. 22. On that day, 10 March 2005, the appellant, being dissatisfied with the finding of Magistrate O'Shane, lodged a Notice of Appeal to this court. 23. On 3 May 2006 the appellant appeared before me for the hearing of his appeal. Ms McSpedden, of counsel, instructed by Mr P Kenny, solicitor, appeared for the appellant. I received the documentary material which had been admitted into evidence before Magistrate O'Shane and the transcript of the evidence given to her, and I heard evidence from Dr Wong, after which I stood over the proceedings to 4 May 2006. 24. On 4 May 2006 I heard evidence from Dr T O Clarke, after which I stood over the proceedings to 30 June 2006. 25. On 30 June 2006 I heard evidence from Dr C Stevenson, psychologist, an expert on the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and treatment of sufferers of it and then submissions from the Crown Prosecutor and Ms McSpedden, after which I told the Crown Prosecutor and Ms McSpedden that I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence and then I stood over the proceedings to 11 August 2006 for judgment and sentencing.26. On 11 August 2006 the appellant appeared before me for judgment and sentencing. On this occasion, Mr S A Levitt, solicitor, appeared for the appellant, as the appellant had withdrawn his instructions to Ms McSpedden and her instructing solicitor. Mr Levitt applied to re-open the appellant's appeal to submit that the count is unfounded if an offence under section 330 is based on answers asked during examination under the Corporations Act. Notwithstanding that the Crown Prosecutor submitted that I should not allow the appellant to re-open his appeal, particularly as I said on 30 June 2006 that I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the offence, I allowed Mr Levitt to re-open the appellant's appeal and I ordered that Mr Levitt file the appellant's submissions not later than 6 April 2006 and that the Crown Prosecutor file the Crown's submissions by 5 September 2006, and I stood over the appeal for further submissions on 23 October 2006.27. On 29 August 2006 I received Mr Levitt's submissions and on about 6 September 2006 I received the Crown Prosecutor's submissions. Then, on 1 October 2006 I received Mr Levitt's submissions in reply to the Crown Prosecutor's submissions. 28. On 13 October 2006 the appellant appeared before me for submissions. On this occasion the Crown Prosecutor handed to me her submissions in reply to Mr Levitt's submissions in reply to her earlier submissions. Then, I heard submissions from Mr Levitt and the Crown Prosecutor, after which I invited the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Levitt to submit written submissions as to such penalty I should impose on the appellant if I rejected the appellant's applications to reject the charge and to permanently stay prosecution of the charge. 29. On 30 October 2006 I received the Crown Prosecutor's submissions as to sentence and at some time after 30 October 2006 I received Mr Levitt's submissions dated 11 August 2006 as to sentence in reply to the Crown Prosecutor's submissions. Then, on 19 January 2007 I received a letter dated that day from Mr Levitt adding to his earlier submissions, which prompted a letter dated 22 January 2007 from the Crown Prosecutor commenting upon Mr Levitt's further submissions.30. Considering, firstly, the question whether the evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt the appellant's commission of the offence with which he had been charged, because, if the appellant's guilt has not been proved by the evidence beyond reasonable doubt, then the appellant is entitled to have the appeal allowed and the charge dismissed, whatever be the decision on the issues raised by Mr Levitt. 31. Thus, the question to be determined is whether the evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that, when he made the false statements to the Deputy Registrar in answer to the questions asked by Mr Braham during the examination on 15 March 2002, the appellant knew that the statements were false. 32. The prosecution's case is that, when the transcript of the evidence given by the appellant is read, it is obvious that the appellant understood what he had been asked and that he responded appropriately to what he had been asked, albeit that his answers to the questions, referred to above, were false. 33. The appellant's case is that, accepting that his answers to the particular questions are false, his answers were not knowingly, in the sense of deliberately or intentionally, false because, as he is a sufferer of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, he confabulated when answering the questions. 34. I accept that the appellant's false answers to the particular questions could have been; (1) deliberately and intentionally false; (2) a mistake due to a lapse in memory or to a faulty memory; or, (3) due to some other cause, whether psychological or psychiatric or otherwise, such as acquired brain damage. 35. I do not doubt that the appellant is a sufferer from adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and that he had been treated for it for some time before 15 March 2002.36. I have considered the evidence of Dr Wong, Dr Clarke and Dr Stevenson. I note that Dr Stevenson had a report of Dr Barten dated 3 September 2004, which was not put before Magistrate O'Shane or me. I realise that there are differences between the opinions of Dr Wong, Dr Clarke and Dr Stevenson. Frankly, I fail to see how the hypotheses of either Dr Clarke or Dr Stevenson could be elevated to a reasonable possibility in the absence of an explanation by the appellant for his false answers to the particular questions asked by Mr Braham. Also, I doubt, in view of my assessment of other evidence, that I need to prefer one doctor's opinion to that of another doctor. But, having said that, I prefer the opinion of Dr Wong to that of Dr Clarke and Dr Stevenson because, frankly, his opinion accords with logic and common sense.37. I agree with the Crown Prosecutor that there is nothing to show, or to suggest, that, when he was in court between 4.05 pm and about 5 pm on 15 March 2002 answering the questions asked of him by Mr Braham, the appellant was under any undue stress or that he had taken any medication or that he needed to take any medication. 38. Although I agree with the appellant's former counsel, Ms McSpedden, that the reading of the transcript of evidence will not show the reader whether the witness paused before beginning to answer a question or whether the witness paused during giving an answer to a question, I consider, reading the transcript of the appellant's answers to Mr Braham's questions, that, as the Crown Prosecutor submitted, the appellant appreciated the reason for his examination and he understood the questions that he was asked and he answered those questions with an appropriate response. The facts that the appellant prefaced his answer to 199 of 236 questions with the word ""privilege"" and that he used word ""privilege"" in his answer to 11 of the remaining 37 questions shows that he was in control of himself and his answers. Furthermore, the facts that he did not preface his answer with the word ""privilege"" or use the word ""privilege"" in his answers to only 28 of 236 questions confirms that he was in control of himself and his answers, particularly as 15 of those 28 questions were not directly related to the affairs of Actwane Pty Ltd. 39. In the absence of an explanation by the appellant for his false answers to the particular questions asked by Mr Braham, I cannot see as a remote possibility that the appellant's answers were due to a lapse of memory or a faulty memory, particularly as the appellant was asked questions shortly after 4.05 pm about his activities during the preceding eight hours, and I cannot accept that he had forgotten what he had done, or that he believed he had done something else. 40. Accordingly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant answered the particular questions asked by Mr Braham, and referred to above, falsely, knowing his answers to be false. 41. I am unable to say why the appellant answered the particular questions falsely, because, as I have said already, the appellant has not given evidence as to his reason for answering the questions in the way that he answered them. Perhaps he simply thought that he could say what he liked to questions that he considered not directly related to the affairs of Actwane Pty Ltd. 42. Considering now the question whether the appellant could be found guilty of the subject offence which, as I have said, is an offence contrary to s 330 of the Crimes Act, based upon answers given to questions asked in an examination under s 596A of the Corporations Act.43. Mr Levitt's first submission is that the questions asked by Mr Braham, upon the answers to which the Crown based the charge against the appellant, should not have been allowed by the Deputy Registrar because they did not relate to the ""examinable affairs"" of Actwane Pty Ltd. 44. The Crown Prosecutor's reply to Mr Levitt's first submission is that the questions asked by Mr Braham were allowable because; (1) Skybar was a business purchased by Actwane Pty Ltd and within the ""examinable affair"", of Actwane Pty Ltd; (2) the questions related to the appellant's failure to attend court as required by the summons; and, (3) the questions related to the appellant's credibility. 45. I accept that, as provided for by s 597 (5B) of the Corporations Act, the Deputy Registrar had power to allow only questions about ""the corporation"", that is Actwane Pty Ltd, or ""any of the examinable affairs"" of Actwane Pty Ltd to be put by Mr Braham to the appellant during the appellant's examination. 46. I consider that, as Actwane Pty Ltd had purchased the Skybar, and as Actwane Holdings Pty Ltd was registered as the owner of the Skybar, questions about the Skybar were allowable questions about Actwane Pty Ltd and its examinable affairs.47. As I do not know Mr Braham's reason for asking the particular questions of the appellant, I cannot say that the questions were ""fishing"" questions or that they were related to the appellant's failure to attend court as required by the summons or to his credibility. It may well be that Mr Braham was laying the foundation for a particular line of questions which, as the examination of the appellant unfolded, did not need to be asked. 48. I accept that, whether or not Mr Braham knew the movements of the appellant during the morning of 15 March 2002, and I note that the Crown Prosecutor has conceded in her submissions received on 1 October 2006 that Mr Braham knew the appellant's movements, the questions asked by Mr Braham of the appellant were allowable questions about Actwane Pty Ltd or its examinable affairs. 49. I also accept that, whatever was Mr Braham's reason for asking the questions of the appellant, the questions were allowable as they related to the appellant's credibility. However, I consider that, if the questions related only to the appellant's failure to attend court as required by the summons, then the questions would not have been related to Actwane Pty Ltd or its examinable affairs or to the appellant's credibility and, therefore, they would not have been allowable.50. But, I do not overlook the obvious that, whether or not the questions were allowable, the appellant was a witness in court and he was on his oath and he was asked questions and he answered the questions and he gave false answers and, as I have found, he knew that his answers were false when giving them. 51. Mr Levitt's second submission is that, as s 1311 of the Corporations Act creates the offence of making a statement which is false or misleading in a material particular contrary to s 597 (7) (c) of the Act, for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of two years or a fine of a maximum of $11,000, or both, the appellant cannot be charged with or, if charged, found guilty of an offence contrary to s 330 of the Crimes Act as the Corporations Act ""covers the field"". 52. Mr Levitt's submission, although these are not his words, is that, if the appellant's conduct is dealt with in different ways by Commonwealth and State Acts, then, by s109 of the Commonwealth Constitution, the Commonwealth Act overrides the State Act and the State Act, to the extent of its inconsistency, is invalid. 53. The Crown Prosecutor's reply to Mr Levitt's second submission is that the Corporations Act provides by s5E(1) that it, the Act, does not exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any law of a state or territory, and by subs(5) that, if an act is both an offence against the Corporations Act and an offence against the law of a state or territory and a person is convicted of either of these offences, then the person is not liable to be convicted of the other of those offences. 54. In my opinion the Corporations Act contemplates that there might be a law of a state or territory which has concurrent operation with the Corporations Act, and recognises that an act which is contrary to the Corporations Act may also be contrary to a law of a state or territory and that the person committing the act may be prosecuted under the Corporations Act or the concurrent law of the state or territory. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the Corporations Act was not intended to and does not ""cover the field"" and that, in any event, s330 of the Crimes Act is not inconsistent with s597(7) of the Corporations Act. 55. The offence contrary to s597(7) of the Corporations Act which is created by s1311(1)(a) of the Act occurs when a person being examined under either s596A or s596B of the Act makes a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular. As Mr Levitt pointed out, criminal liability for a false or misleading statement made by a person during an examination under either s596A or s596B of the Act arises if the statement is false or misleading in a material particular, that is, material to be the purpose of the examination. 56. The offence contrary to s330 of the Crimes Act occurs when a person makes on oath a false statement, not amounting to perjury, knowing the statement to be false or not believing it to be true. As the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, there is a clear distinction between an offence of making a false statement contrary to s330 of the Crimes Act and the offence of perjury contrary to s327 of that Act, which occurs when a person in or in connection with judicial proceedings makes a statement on oath concerning any matter which is material to the proceedings knowing the statement to be false or not believing it to be true, which is an offence similar to the offence contrary to s597(7) of the Corporations Act. 57. In my opinion the appellant could have been charged with an offence contrary to s597(7) of the Corporations Act as the false answers related to Actwane Pty Limited or to its examinable affairs, or an offence contrary to s327 of the Crimes Act as the false answers were material to the proceedings, or, as he was charged, an offence contrary to s330 of the Crimes Act. I consider that it was a decision for the prosecutor to make as to whether to proceed with a charge under s597(7) of the Corporations Act or under either s327 or s330 of the Crimes Act. 58. As I have said already, I am of the opinion that s330 of the Crimes Act is not inconsistent with s597(7) of the Corporations Act. This is because s597(7) of the Corporations Act applies to a statement which is false or misleading in a material particular whereas s330 of the Crimes Act applies to a false statement made on oath. The elements of an offence contrary to s597(7) of the Corporations Act are different from the elements of an offence contrary to s330 of the Crimes Act. In my opinion the offences can and do stand side by side. 59. Mr Levitt's third submission is that the prosecution of the appellant upon the charge brought against him should be stayed because it would be an abuse of the Court's process to permit the appellant to be prosecuted for a false answer given to a Deputy Registrar during an examination under s596A of the Corporations Act. 60. I have found Mr Levitt's submission as to a stay of prosecution based upon an abuse of the Court's process difficult to understand. I assume that Mr Levitt means that, because the appellant was required to attend court for examination about Actwane Pty Limited and its examinable affairs, and because concurrent proceedings by the receiver of Actwane Pty Limited to rectify the ownership of a Skybar were on foot, and because Mr Braham, when he asked the particular questions of the appellant, knew the correct answers to the questions, and because the appellant's answers to the questions asked by him went to his credibility, as well as to the affairs of Actwane Pty Limited, and because the questions were asked to obtain evidence for a concurrent rectification proceedings or to base a future prosecution of the appellant, to permit the prosecution of the appellant to continue would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 61. The Crown Prosecutor's reply to Mr Levitt's third submission is that there is nothing to suggest that the prosecution of the appellant is illegal or unjustified, or oppressive or unfair, or for an illegitimate purpose such as to bring the judicial process into disrepute. 62. Accepting that there were concurrent proceedings by the receiver of Actwane Pty Limited to rectify the ownership of the Skybar, and accepting that Mr Braham knew the movements of the appellant of the morning of 15 March 2002 and, therefore, that he knew the correct answers to his questions, and accepting that the appellant's answers to the questions asked of him by Mr Braham may have been used in the concurrent proceedings does not mean that the questions were asked to trap the appellant or to base a prosecution of him. If he had answered the questions honestly, and Mr Braham did not know whether he would answer the questions honestly, he would not have created any problem for himself and he would not have been prosecuted. 63. I cannot see any proper basis upon which the prosecution of the appellant should be stayed. There is nothing to suggest any impropriety on the part of the prosecutor or the prosecuting authority, and there is nothing to suggest that the prosecution was unfair or an abuse of the Court's process. 64. In the result I am satisfied, as I have said already, that the appellant's answers to the particular questions asked of him by Mr Braham were false, and they were given by him knowing them to be false. Accordingly, I find the appellant to be guilty of the offence with which he was charged, and I convict him of that offence. 65. I consider now the sentence to be imposed on the appellant for the offence. 66. As I have said already, the offence of making a false statement on oath knowing the statement to be false is an offence contrary to s330 of the Crimes Act, for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of five years when dealt with on indictment, or imprisonment for a maximum of two years if dealt with summarily. 67. On 10 March 2005 Magistrate 0'Shane sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for the period of 18 months, with a non-parole period of 12 months and a parole period of six months, although she did not give any reasons for that sentence or for departing from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period. 68. As to the objective seriousness of the offence, I consider that it is beyond argument that lying when giving evidence on oath in a court is very serious, with the degree of seriousness depending upon the materiality of the lie, and that, except in exceptional circumstances, a sentence of imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence to be imposed upon a witness who lies when giving evidence on oath in a court: See R v Bulliman 25 February 1993 unreported; R v Aristodemou 30 June 1994 unreported; R v Chapman 21 May 1998 unreported. As to the appellant's false answers I see them as falling towards the low end of the range of seriousness for an offence of their kind. 69. As to the subjective features relating to the appellant: He was born on 17 January 1940. Accordingly, he was aged 62 years and two months when he committed the offence and he is aged 67 years three months now. He was educated at primary and secondary schools in the Newcastle area. He attended Sydney University and obtained a degree in Veterinary Science. He practised as a veterinary surgeon in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney from 1964 to 1982. He married during 1978 and he and his wife are the parents of two children. He operated as a property developer from 1982 until he was declared bankrupt during 1991. He was discharged from bankruptcy during 1994, and he resumed his operations as a property developer until he was again declared bankrupt during 2003. He and his wife separated during 2002 and their marriage was dissolved during 2003. He blames the stresses related to his property development operations and to his subsequent bankruptcy for his wife's estrangement from him. He was discharged from his second bankruptcy during 2006. He does not own any property or have any assets. He is in receipt of a pension. He enjoys good physical health but, as I have said already, he suffers from adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, for which he takes prescribed medicine. He has an unblemished character, albeit I know that it has transpired that he has pleaded guilty to a number of offences related to his misuse of the money of Actwane Pty Ltd, for which he is to appear in this Court during April 2007 for sentencing. 70. In determining an appropriate sentence to impose upon the appellant for the offence I must recognise the purposes of sentencing referred to in s3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and I must take into account such of the aggravating factors referred to in s21A(2) of the Act as are present, and such are the mitigating factors referred to in subs (3) of that section as are present, and any other relevant factor. 71. As to s21 A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I consider that none of the aggravating factors referred to in subs (2) is present, and that the mitigating factors present are those referred to in paragraphs lettered (e), (f), and (h) of subs (3). 72. One factor not mentioned in s21 A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is deterrence. Although personal deterrence may not be as important in this case as it might be in another case, general deterrence is important and cannot be overlooked or undervalued as lying when giving evidence on oath strikes at the foundation of the judicial system and undermines it. Witnesses, whether giving evidence in a trial or a civil hearing, or before a Deputy Registrar during an examination of a company's affairs, or a commissioner of the ICAC or the ACC, must be deterred from lying by knowing that lying will be punished by a sentence of imprisonment. 73. What, then, having regard to what I have said about the offence and the appellant is an appropriate sentence to impose upon the appellant for that offence? 74. Mr Levitt and the Crown Prosecutor have made submissions as to sentence, and they are have referred me to many cases. I have considered their submissions and I have read the cases. I did not see any need to refer specifically to those submissions or the cases. 75. I have determined, balancing the purposes of sentencing, the objective seriousness of the offence, the subjective features of the offender, the mitigating factors referred to and deterrence, that the sentence should be imprisonment for 12 months, and that, in view of the appellant's age, his previous character and his state of health, the non-parole period and the parole period should each be six months. 76. As to whether execution of the sentence should be suspended or whether, if execution is not suspended, the sentence should be served on a full-time or periodic detention basis, I have decided that, because of the appellant's age, his previous character, the fact that he had never served a prison sentence, and the passage of time between 15 March 2002 and today, execution of the sentence should be suspended for the period of it. 77.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      Background 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 28 August 1993 three persons were stabbed to death at domestic premises in Prince Edward Road, Woronora. One was Steven Gilham, another was his wife Helen Gilham and the third was one of their two sons, Christopher Gilham. Each had been killed by multiple stab wounds to the chest. A fire had been lit in the premises and the bodies of Mr and Mrs Gilham were partly burned. 
     
      
    2 On 29 August 1993 Police charged the remaining son, Jeffrey Gilham (the accused), with the murder of his brother Christopher. He was committed for trial to the Supreme Court. On 5 April 1995 the accused pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his brother, which plea was accepted in full discharge of the indictment for murder. The basis of the plea of guilty was provocation arising from the killing by Christopher Gilham of his parents. 
     
      
    3 Mr Justice Abadee sentenced the accused on 7 April 1995. He deferred passing sentence on the accused upon his entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for five years and subject to certain conditions including overseas travel restrictions and psychiatric assistance. 
     
      
    4 On 21 February 2006 the Director of Public Prosecutions (the Director) filed an ex officio indictment in the Supreme Court alleging that the accused murdered his parents. 
     
      
    5 On 29 September 2006 by Notice of Motion the accused sought a permanent stay of proceedings. 
     
      
    6 The application raises three bases for the submission that it would be an abuse of process to permit the Crown to proceed on the charges of murder. The first ground is that it would be oppressive in the circumstances to subject the accused to a trial by reason of the delay in commencing the proceedings and its attendant prejudice to the accused. The second ground is that it is not open to the Crown to seek from the jury verdicts that would be inconsistent with the conviction of manslaughter following the plea of guilty to that offence in 1995. Although it is conceded that there is no patent inconsistency between a verdict of manslaughter of his brother and verdicts of murder of each of the parents, it is submitted that there must of necessity be a factual inconsistency between the verdicts and such, if allowed to stand, would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The third ground is that it would be vexatious and oppressive to bring a further prosecution arising from the incidents of 28 August 1993. 
     
      
       
      The accused is sentenced for manslaughter 
      
    7 As has been noted, the accused pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court to the offence of manslaughter in respect of his brother, Christopher, and the Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment for murder. The Crown Prosecutor at the outset of the proceedings announced that the plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted on the basis of provocation. When the Judge asked what was the “matter of provocation relied upon”, the Crown Prosecutor answered: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The prisoner having been confronted with the sight of both his parents deceased and having been informed by his brother, now deceased, that he, the brother, was responsible for the death of the two parents and, indeed, immediately thereafter setting fire to the bodies of the deceased parents.” 
        
       
      
    8 A statement of facts was tendered on the sentencing proceedings. Those facts were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “About 4.50 am on Saturday, 28 August 1993, Police and Fire Brigade officers attended 117 Prince Edward Park Road Woronora, in response to calls to “000”. Upon arrival they discovered that the bedroom, loungeroom and kitchen areas, which comprise the upstairs portion of the house, were well alight. 
         
         
        After the fire was extinguished the charred bodies of Stephan John Gilham (58 old) and his wife, Helen Margaret Gilham (55 old) were respectively located in the main bedroom and loungeroom in those premises. Upon further examination the deceased body of Christopher John Gilham (25 old) was discovered in the downstairs room who had been stabbed a number of times. A post mortem examination revealed that Stephen Gilham had been stabbed 29 times, Helen Gilham 17 times and Christopher Gilham 17 times. The deceased persons were the mother, father and brother of the accused. 
         
         
        The accused was later arrested at his home after it became apparent, from his own admissions, that he was responsible for the death of his brother Christopher. He was subsequently conveyed to Sutherland Police Station where he was later electronically interviewed in relation to the matter. 
         
         
        The accused informed Police that he responded to a frantic intercom call from his mother after he was wakened from his dwelling, being a converted boatshed some 50-70 metres from the main house on the river line at the rear of the property. Upon entering the house the accused allegedly saw his brother Christopher standing beside their mother, who was lying on the floor, who the accused presumed was deceased. As the accused approached his brother he (the accused) alleged his brother stated, words to the effect, ‘I’ve killed Mum and Dad”, and with that saw a lit match in his brother’s hand. As the accused drew nearer, his brother placed that match onto their mother’s body which ignited immediately. The fire then spread rapidly to the main bedroom where the accused saw the presumed deceased [body] of his father lying on the floor. With that, the accused stated that he responded and grabbed a knife, which was allegedly on the floor near to where his brother was standing, picked it up and chased his brother down a spiral staircase to a downstairs room where he fatally stabbed his brother a number of times. The accused stated that he attempted to return upstairs but was unsuccessful due the to well developed fire and smoke in the upstairs portion of the house. He reported the incident to a neighbour shortly thereafter who notified ‘000’ about 4.35am. 
         
         
        The accused has given an account of events to Police which in their simplest form are a feasible account of what may have happened. The investigation to date has been unable to refute that scenario, despite a thorough scientific analysis and evaluation of the scene and available evidence. 
         
         
        A motive for the murders has not been established. It would appear, however, from the investigation that the accused had expressed a concern to some close friends in terms of his brother’s recent adverse behaviour towards his father. That expressed concern, at this stage, stands alone without the benefit of independent corroboration from other close friends of the deceased family. 
        
       
      
    9 In his sentencing remarks on 7 April 1995, the Judge referred to the statement of the prosecutor, set out above, and accepted it as reflecting a summary of the evidence before him. He described the offence as “manslaughter in circumstances of grave and, indeed, even extreme provocation”. Later his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In this case a human being, the brother, then aged 25 years, has lost his life. A brother has caused the death of another brother. As will be seen from my reasons the deceased’s death was occasioned by violent means, namely, by stabbing. The stabbing was not merely a stabbing on one instant, but on seventeen instances in a frenzy. I cannot, the community cannot, hear the deceased speak for himself, to give his version of the events which preceded his being stabbed to death. He is dead, and dead because the prisoner killed him. The explanation for the killing of his parents, and I accept they died at his hands, has died with him. Indeed, the evidence does not permit me to make a finding even if one were appropriate, or to express a view as to why the brother, Christopher, should have killed either or both of his parents. The evidence does not enable me to find any acceptable motive for his killing either or both of them, nor, as I have said is it necessary for me to do so. However, even if it were appropriate to canvass this matter further, I would be unable, on the evidence before me, to do more than speculate, and that is precisely what I do not propose to do.” 
        
       
      
    10 Later, when recounting the circumstances of the manslaughter, the Judge adopted the facts of the killing as set out in the tendered Statement of Facts. His Honour also referred at length to the accused’s interview with police. He then went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The objective gravity of this otherwise serious offence of manslaughter committed in, as I have said, somewhat unique and exceptional circumstances is reduced by several factors. It appears to be common ground between counsel for the prisoner and counsel for the Crown (I invited the Crown to assist me by way of submissions) that the provocation offered to the prisoner at the time was both grave and extreme. Further or alternatively, the extent of loss of self control is not only revealed by the evidence to which I have referred, but is also reflected in some ways in the psychiatric evidence to which I will return and which I will consider when dealing with the relevant subjective factors. Indeed the loss of self control in the matter was clearly of a very grave nature and in my view of considerable magnitude. Indeed, even those words that I have used may not even fully and aptly described the loss of self control in the instant matter. 
        
       
      
    11 There were psychiatric and psychological reports tendered in evidence before the Judge describing the reaction of the accused to the acts of his brother and his mental state at the time of the killing. It is unnecessary to refer further to that material but the views and opinions expressed in those reports were based on an acceptance of the facts as stated by the accused in his interview with police as to the circumstances of the killing. The reports referred to the effects of the trauma upon the accused and his prospects for rehabilitation. In addition there was a considerable body of lay evidence touching upon the relationship of the accused and the remaining members of his family including his grandmother. The evidence was to the effect that “the whole family is behind him”. 
     
      
       
      Further proceedings on murder charges 
      
    12 On 8 June 1995 an inquest was held touching the death of the accused’s parents before the Deputy State Coroner. The Officer in Charge of the investigation gave evidence at the inquest of the account given by the accused in a recorded interview as to the circumstances surrounding the killing of his brother describing it as “feasible”. He also noted that this version of events had not been refuted by evidence. The Coroner concluded, in effect, that the accused’s brother, Christopher, had killed his parents. 
     
      
    13 It appears that after 1995 the accused and members of his family fell out apparently over the administration of the parents’ estate. The family agitated for a further investigation into their deaths. This culminated in a television programme in 1997 raising the family’s concerns. 
     
      
    14 A second police investigation commenced in September 1999. Ultimately advice was sought from the Director and he recommended that the matter be referred to the Coroner. 
     
      
    15 On 10 April 2000 the Deputy State Coroner commenced a second inquest touching upon the death of the accused’s parents. On 28 April 2000 the inquest was terminated as the Coroner found that there was evidence capable of satisfying a jury that a known person had committed an indictable offence. The depositions of the inquest were forwarded to the Director pursuant to s 19 of the Coroner’s Act. In effect the Coroner found that the accused should stand trial for the murder of his parents. 
     
      
    16 However, the Director declined to prosecute the accused on the basis that there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction. The Director notified the accused of his decision on 21 July 2000. 
     
      
    17 On 10 May 2001 the accused’s uncle, Tony Gilham, commenced a private prosecution of the accused for the murder of his parents. On 6 June 2001 the prosecution was taken over by the Director and terminated. On that date the Director notified the accused of his decision. On 13 June 2001 the accused was discharged in the Local Court when the prosecutor offered no evidence upon the informations for murder. 
     
      
    18 There were questions raised about the failure to prosecute the accused for his parents’ murder in State Parliament. In September 2001 the Attorney General stated that he would not intervene in the matter, noting that he had received advice that a prosecution was unlikely to succeed. In November 2001 the Attorney General again stated in effect that he would not take any action in respect of the further investigation or prosecution of the accused. 
     
      
    19 On 22 July 2004 a review of the investigations previously conducted into the killings was undertaken. In October 2004 a re-investigation was commenced into the killing of the accused’s parents. A brief of evidence was sent to the Director on 22 November 2005 seeking advice as to whether there was sufficient evidence to charge the accused with the murder of both parents. 
     
      
    20 As has been noted, the Director filed an ex officio indictment in this Court on 21 February 2006. 
     
      
       
      The prosecution case 
      
    21 The Crown tendered before me a detailed analysis of the evidence upon which it would rely in order to prove that the accused murdered his parents. In order to make out its case the Crown would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt the version given to the police by the accused was false or to put it another way must disprove that there was any real possibility that Christopher killed his parents. Further, in asking the jury to find the accused guilty of murdering his parents, the Crown must ask the jury to find facts consistent with the accused murdering Christopher and inconsistent with him killing his brother under the effects of provocation. 
     
      
    22 The prosecution case would of course be a circumstantial case. The Crown has listed eleven categories of evidence upon which it would rely to prove that the accused killed his parents. It has not been suggested by Mr Boulton that the Crown could not prove a case of murder against the accused: the stay of the indictment is not sought on the basis that the Crown case is foredoomed to failure. There was no submission made that there was little prospect of the prosecution succeeding. The only criticism raised as to the evidentiary basis of the Crown case against the accused was that the Crown had, or could have had, all of the evidence it is now relying upon when it decided to accept the plea to manslaughter. In effect it was submitted that the Crown is for all practical purposes in no better position to prove that the accused killed his parents at the present time than at any other time when it was considering whether charges should be laid against the accused for the murder of his parents. 
     
      
    23 In these circumstances it is unnecessary to consider the Crown’s evidence and arguments in any great detail. However, before considering the nature of the evidence that would be relied upon by the Crown if there were to be a trial, I should summarise very briefly the physical evidence seen at the house shortly after the killings and give a little more detail of the accused’s version of events. 
     
      
       
        
        The physical evidence 
        
       
      
    24 The accused resided in a converted boatshed at the rear of the main premises in which his parents and brother lived. The main house was of two storeys with the top storey at street level. An internal staircase connected the two storeys that led down to a multi-purpose room and Christopher’s bedroom. 
     
      
    25 After the fire was extinguished police and fire brigade officers found the bodies of the accused’s parents and brother. There was fire damage to the top storey of the house in the lounge room, main bedroom and kitchen areas. Mr Gilham was on his back on the floor of the main bedroom. Mrs Gilham was face down in the lounge room. Christopher was on his back in the lower floor billiard room. He was dressed only in a shave coat and his body was unaffected by fire. 
     
      
    26 A knife was located near the body of Christopher with the blade pointing to the ceiling and the handle tucked between the body and his left arm. In the laundry was a syringe filled with a paste made of paracetamol. There was a cup containing a similar paste and an empty blister pack. Two empty syringes were found in Christopher’s bedroom. There was an axe located on the floor of the main bedroom between the body of Mr Gilham and the bed. A “jerry can” was found outside the house next to the garden hose and near the garbage bins. The lid of the can was unlocked and a short length of hose was found in the carport. 
     
      
       
      The accused’s version 
      
    27 The accused stated that he was sleeping when he received a call from his mother on the intercom. She was yelling and he could not understand her. He rushed to the house but locked the door of the shed as he left. He entered the house through the sliding kitchen doors. He could see his brother in the lounge room near the piano. 
     
      
    28 As the accused entered Christopher told him that he had killed their parents and proceeded to set fire to his mother. The accused could see his father in the bedroom. He did not attempt to put out the fire but picked up the knife that was lying on the lounge room floor. The fire spread fast from his mother to his father in the main bedroom. By the time he took up the knife and chased his brother downstairs, he could see that both his parents were on fire. 
     
      
    29 After he stabbed his brother he went upstairs and saw smoke. He left the house by the sliding doors to get help. He then went to a neighbour, Mr Warner, who rang 000. 
     
      
       
        
        The circumstantial case 
         
        (a) similarities of the wounds 
        
       
      
    30 The first of the circumstances to be relied upon by the Crown is the similarities in the stab wounds inflicted upon each of the three victims. Put shortly the Crown would ask the jury to conclude that they reveal that the same person killed all three victims. The Crown relies upon the total number of wounds inflicted upon each victim, the number of grouped stab wounds and the fact that the grouped wounds were all in the heart region. It argues that the nature and the number of the wounds indicate that the killer was acting in “extreme anger” and not just with an intention to kill the victim. 
     
      
    31 The Crown intends to call expert evidence as to the similarity of the wounds inflicted on each of the deceased although it concedes that those witnesses could not give evidence that it was the same person that killed each, as that would be an opinion outside the witness’s expertise. 
     
      
       
        
        (b) voices heard prior to 000 call 
        
       
      
    32 The Crown would rely upon evidence of voices heard at the Gilham property about half an hour before the 000 call was made at 4.34am. A witness would give evidence of raised female and male voices arguing for a period of about 5 minutes. The Crown will claim that the female voice was Mrs Gilham, the only female at the house. The Crown argues that, had Mr Gilham been alive at that time, there would have been evidence of defence wounds on his body, but the evidence indicates that he was killed while he slept in bed. The Crown contends that this must have been before the shouting. There was no further noise heard from the house before it was set alight at about 4.30am. 
     
      
    33 According to the Crown, the jury could conclude that the sounds heard were the killing of Mr and Mrs Gilham about half an hour before the 000 call and that this was inconsistent with the accused’s version of Mrs Gilham making a call for help on the intercom just prior to the 000 call. The Crown argues that it would, therefore, be open to the jury to find that the accused’s version is untrue. 
     
      
       
        
        (c) evidence concerning the boatshed, keys and folded clothes 
        
       
      
    34 The police found that the boatshed, where the accused lived, was locked and the keys were upstairs in the house. Police also found clothes, worn by the accused earlier that day, under the lounge in the house. They were affected by fire. The sliding door of the house, from which he exited, was closed. 
     
      
    35 The Crown argues that these facts are inconsistent with the version given by the accused. Why, asks the Crown, would the accused lock his premises and take his keys, if he were answering a distress call from his mother? Why would his clothes be found in the house, if, as he said, he left the house after watching television to go to the boatshed where he went to bed? Why would he close the sliding door, if the house were on fire? The Crown would submit to the jury that the evidence is inconsistent with the accused’s version and only consistent with him taking off his clothes in the house before killing his parents. 
     
      
       
        
        (d) the smell of accelerant on his breath 
        
       
      
    36 The neighbour, to whom, the accused raised the alarm, smelled kerosene and smoke on the breath of the accused. In what the Crown describes as “significant fresh evidence obtained”, one of the fire brigade officers, Mr Wright, says that he noticed the smell of petrol coming from the accused’s body as he sat on the curb. A “jerry can” with a very small amount of petrol and a piece of hose were found in the garden near the house. 
     
      
    37 Initially the accused could not explain to police why he smelled of kerosene but later told of an incident in which he and his father syphoned petrol for the family boat. However, there is evidence that the petrol in the can was not suitable for the boat. Mr Gilham’s brother says that it is inconceivable that he would have used wrong petrol for the boat. 
     
      
    38 The Crown would argue to the jury that this was evidence consistent with the accused having unsuccessfully tried to siphon petrol, perhaps from a motor vehicle, to start the fire. The accelerant used was not petrol but mineral turpentine. The Crown says the explanation given by the accused for his smelling of petrol at around 4.30am is untrue. 
     
      
       
        
        (e) absence of blood on the accused but wet hair 
        
       
      
    39 The accused had no blood on his shorts and only a spot on his foot from which no blood type could initially be ascertained because it was so diluted. It was later found to be consistent with that of his mother. His shorts, the only clothing he was wearing, were not scientifically tested for blood and now cannot be found. 
     
      
    40 The Crown argues that the absence of blood on the accused is consistent only with him having cleaned himself after the killings. This, the Crown contends, is inconsistent with his version of leaving the house straight after killing his brother. The Crown argues that, even had he stabbed only his brother, he would have had blood on him consistent with splatters in the house. 
     
      
    41 The Crown maintains that it has new evidence from two fire officers who claim to have noticed that the accused had wet hair, as though he had taken a shower. One of them believed at the time that the accused must have attempted to put out the fire with a hose. Further in a statement dated January 2005, a neighbour, Ted Warner, says that the accused’s hair appeared “semi wet”” and “groomed”. The Crown contends that this evidence is inconsistent with the account given by the accused that gave him no occasion or opportunity to take a shower after killing his brother. 
     
      
       
        
        (f) the seat of the fire 
        
       
      
    42 The Crown contends that evidence of the location of the seat of the fire is of “considerable importance in this case”. There are a number of expert witnesses both within and outside the Fire Brigade available to give evidence about this matter. The Crown contends that the evidence that would be given by one, or more, of these experts is inconsistent with the version given by the accused to police about the circumstances in which his brother started the fire. The Crown argues that the evidence points to the fire starting in the bedroom and that its spread was not consistent with the accused’s version. 
     
      
    43 The Crown would argue to the jury that, if the accused’s version is incorrect in this aspect, the only reasonable explanation open is that the accused lied about how the fire started because he was responsible for the fire, and hence the killing of his parents. The Crown would argue that the fire was set to eliminate evidence that was inconsistent with his account. 
     
      
    44 The Crown also would rely upon the absence of the remains of any container that might have been used by his brother to start the fire and yet, on the accused’s account, his brother would have had no time to have disposed of the container before the accused attacked him. 
     
      
       
        
        (g) absence of evidence of blood, fingerprints and glasses 
        
       
      
    45 There is considerable evidence as to water penetration into the room in which Christopher’s body was found. The water came down the stairs during attempts to put out or stem the fire in the upstairs part of the house. This may, on one view, be the explanation for the fact that none of his parent’s blood was found on Christopher and no blood at all or fingerprints were found on the knife used to kill him and his parents. However, the Crown would argue to the jury that no amount of water penetration could explain these facts. There is also expert evidence that the knife must have been washed. 
     
      
    46 The Crown would argue to the jury that the absence of a significant amount of blood on the shave coat worn by Christopher is inconsistent with him having inflicted the injuries upon his parents from which they died. There was no DNA testing done of any object, including the shave coat. Traditional blood typing tests showed that blood found on the shave coat could have been that of Christopher or his mother. The Crown would argue that the blood found on the coat was centred around the wounds on Christopher and not consistent with spray patterns expected if he had killed his parents. The Crown would also argue that it was strange that he would kill his parents in a shave coat. 
     
      
    47 The Crown sees relevance in the fact that Christopher’s glasses have never been found notwithstanding evidence that his night vision was poor and he needed glasses to move about safely. The Crown would argue that he would not have murdered his parents without wearing his glasses. Rather the Crown says that the absence of glasses suggests he was awoken by the killing of his parents and was then confronted by the accused. 
     
      
       
        
        (h) manifest absurdities in the accused’s account 
        
       
      
    48 Notwithstanding the evidence given by the police officer at the first coronial hearing and the statement in the facts tendered on sentence as to the feasibility of the applicant’s account, the Crown would contend before a jury that the account contained “manifest absurdities”. These include “the inherent unlikelihood” of the following facts: Christopher having time to kill his mother and lay the accelerant in the time the accused took to get to the house from the boatshed; Christopher admitting to having killed their parents when about to set fire to them and then setting the fire rather than attempting to kill the accused; the accused killing his brother rather than seeking to assist his parents who might not have been dead to his knowledge or to put out the fire; the absence of anger or any other motive of the accused to kill his brother offered to the police. 
     
      
       
        
        (i) other evidence 
        
       
      
    49 The Crown relies upon what it says are inconsistencies in accounts given by the accused. It also argues that there was a motive for the accused to kill his parents in order to obtain their estate. The Crown would also rely upon a tape recording, recently discovered but made many years before the killing, in which the accused is said to have made statements indicating dissatisfaction with, what he saw, as the favoured status of his brother in the eyes of his parents. There is also the paracetamol paste found in a syringe belonging to the accused that the Crown says was the preparation for a different method of killing his parents. There is some evidence that Mrs Gilham had expressed concerns about the accused shortly before her death. 
     
      
    50 From the combination of these circumstances the Crown contends that there are four matters that would be of significance to a jury in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s version of events could not be true: (i) that the accused washed himself prior to starting the fire; (ii) that the killings occurred half an hour before the accused raised the alarm; (iii) that the accused had hydrocarbon on his breath from an attempt to obtain accelerant for the fire; (iv) that the fire started in the bedroom near his father’s body. The Crown submits that it has fresh evidence of significance at least in regard to matters (i) and (iii). 
     
      
       
      Commencement of these proceedings 
      
    51 Evidence was called before me as to the circumstances in which the further investigation of the death of the accused’s parents occurred. There was much debate between the parties as to the relevance and quality of, what has been referred to as, fresh evidence arising from the further investigation and tending, in the Crown’s view, to prove that the accused murdered both parents. This fresh evidence is put forward by way of justification for the Director commencing a prosecution of the accused for the murder of his parents even though he had refused to do so on an earlier occasion and had brought such a prosecution commenced by Mr Gilham’s brother to an end. 
     
      
    52 Strictly speaking there is no need for the Crown to justify its actions. There is no suggestion that it has acted in the past, or is now presently acting, mala fides in the way it has conducted proceedings arising from the deaths of the parents and Christopher. Although the Crown had indicated that it was not going to proceed against the accused for the murder of his parents, it is not precluded by any rule of law or practice from now doing so. But it is relevant to the question of whether these proceedings are oppressive that the Crown asserts that there has been a change in the available evidence that now makes proceedings against the accused for the murder of his parents appropriate. Although there were submissions about the strength or otherwise of the new evidence, I do not understand that a decision on that question was seen as decisive of the outcome of this application either by the accused or by the Crown. 
     
      
    53 Detective Rupp was called by the Crown to give evidence about the reinvestigation. He stated that it was commenced in response to an affidavit received in May 2004 from Mr Warner, a neighbour of the Gilham family at the time of the killings. The receipt of this document led the police to review the previous investigation and make inquiries as to the availability of exhibits. The result of those inquiries was that the exhibits could not be located and Detective Rupp gave the opinion that they had been destroyed “probably around ’95 shortly after the accused was sentenced for the manslaughter of his brother”. The missing exhibits included all the physical evidence obtained from the scene of the killings. Following the review of the earlier investigations, a decision was made to re-open the investigation. 
     
      
       
        
        The fresh evidence 
        
       
      
    54 The fresh evidence now available to the Crown includes both expert and lay evidence. The expert evidence largely relates to the injuries suffered by each of the deceased, the seat of the fire, analysis of blood splatters and DNA testing. Some of that evidence was received as late as June 2006 but much of it was available at the time of the second inquest in 2000. It seems to me that this evidence largely confirms evidence that was available at the time the applicant was prosecuted for the killing of his brother. Most, if not all, of it would have been available at the time of the first prosecution had it been sought by the investigators or the Director. 
     
      
    55 The Crown sees particular significance in evidence now available about the state of wetness of the accused’s hair when the fire brigade was in attendance. There are statements from two fire officers obtained in 2005 about this subject. Officer Wright states that the accused’s hair was “not dripping wet but definitely wet.” Officer Polson states that “his hair was still wet but not dripping”. Mr Warner, the neighbour, in a statement dated 2004, states: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not recall his hair being wet but I could equally not say that his hair was dry. His hair was shiny. It was what it looks like when I have wet hair after a shower and I have towelled it to near dryness and brushed or combed it”. 
        
       
      
    56 The Crown would argue that the only explanation for the accused having wet hair was that he had showered before seeking help, which fact would also explain the absence of blood on him. There is no possible basis upon which the accused’s version of events could be true and yet he had the opportunity or occasion to shower before leaving the house to seek help. 
     
      
    57 There is fresh evidence attempting to rebut the accused’s account of syphoning petrol for the boat. There is a statement from the then girlfriend of the accused indicating that she has no recollection of the accused and his father syphoning petrol despite the accused stating that she was present when it occurred. The brother of Mr Gilham would give evidence that Mr Gilham would never have considered using petrol from a motor vehicle to place in the engine of his boat. 
     
      
    58 There are recent statements of friends and associates of Christopher commenting on his need for glasses. There is also the tape of the accused making comments about his family in light of a book he was studying. 
     
      
    59 The accused submits that the fresh evidence is either not reliable or is insufficiently relevant to justify the commencement of further proceedings by the Director. In particular criticism is made of Mr Warner, the neighbour, and his recent statement made in relation to the state of the accused’s hair on the night of the killings. It is submitted that his most recent account is inconsistent with evidence he gave before the Coroner and to some extent with the statutory declaration he made in March 2004 that led to the rekindling of police interest in investigating the killings. The accused also points to the dramatic change in the attitude of Mr Warner from support for him at the time of sentencing to antipathy to him as a murderer in his declaration in December 2004. 
     
      
    60 The statements of the two fire brigade officers as to the state of the accused at the time they were fighting the fire are criticised on the basis that neither was asked to make a statement at the initial investigation. Their statements were taken in 2005, more than 11 years after the incident, and yet both now purport to give detailed evidence as to the state of the accused’s hair in somewhat similar terms. 
     
      
    61 It was submitted on the part of the accused that any fresh scientific evidence does not advance the prosecution case from that which it had at the time of charging the accused or at least by the time of the second coronial inquiry. It is also noted that no explanation is given for such evidence not being obtained at the time of the first investigation. It was submitted that these were attempts to bolster the prosecution case either to justify the further proceedings or to make the prosecution case appear more viable than it really is. 
     
      
    62 None of the witnesses to give fresh evidence were called before me. They will no doubt be subject to criticism at trial chiefly in relation to their reliability in light of the period of time that has elapsed since the events surrounding the killings and the making of their statements. At least Mr Warner and Mr Gilham’s uncle will be criticised on grounds of bias and the change in their attitude to the accused between the time of sentencing and the time of making the further statements. 
     
      
    63 In criticising the relevance of weight of the new evidence, my attention was taken by the accused to recent legislation permitting a further prosecution for an offence to be undertaken against a person who has been acquitted of that offence where there is “fresh and compelling evidence” that the person committed the offence. Section 102 of the Crimes Appeal and Review Act 2001 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        102 Fresh and compelling evidence - meaning 
         
          
          (1) This section applies for the purpose of determining under this Division whether there is fresh and compelling evidence against an acquitted person in relation to an offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) Evidence is “fresh” if: 
           
          (a) it was not adduced in the proceedings in which the person was acquitted, and 
           
          (b) it could not have been adduced in those proceedings with the exercise of reasonable diligence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) Evidence is “compelling” if: 
           
          (a) it is reliable, and 
           
          (b) it is substantial, and 
           
          (c) in the context of the issues in dispute in the proceedings in which the person was acquitted, it is highly probative of the case against the acquitted person. 
          
         
        
       
      
    64 The meaning to be attributed to the words “fresh” and “compelling” for the purposes of that Act do not seem to me to have any bearing on the resolution of the application before me. It is readily understandable that the fresh evidence that might trigger the Court of Criminal Appeal’s jurisdiction to order a re-trial under that legislation should have a very high degree of probative value and should not have been reasonably available at the time of the first trial. The legislation is concerned with permitting a re-trial after an acquittal of the charge to be re-tried. These are provisions that abrogate the law against double jeopardy at its very heart: the re-trial of a person who has been acquitted by a jury after a trial according to law. 
     
      
    65 Here, however, the question is whether it is oppressive for the Crown to commence proceedings against the accused for the murder of his parents in circumstances where the Crown has previously indicated that it had no present intention of proceedings against him for those crimes but rather had intervened to stop such a prosecution by his uncle. I accept that in considering the issue of oppression the existence or otherwise of cogent fresh evidence is a relevant consideration. But I doubt that, if there was a significant infringement of the rule against double jeopardy in the Crown proceedings with this prosecution, it would be a relevant consideration that there was fresh evidence now available to the Crown: The Queen v Carroll [2002] HCA 55; (2002) 213 CLR 653 at [44] and [113]. 
     
      
    66 I will consider further the question of the fresh evidence when considering whether the prosecution is so oppressive that it should be stayed. 
     
      
       
      Oppression by delay and prejudice 
      
    67 The jurisdiction of this Court to stay a criminal trial by reason of delay in the commencement of proceedings cannot be doubted. The jurisprudence in respect of abuse of process caused by delay or otherwise is settled, although its application to any particular case can be problematic. It is unnecessary to set out the relevant principles in this judgment or to say any more about the power of this Court generally to protect itself from an abuse of its processes than the following brief observations. 
     
      
    68 The decision to grant a stay is often referred to as discretionary in that it requires a value judgment involving the weighing of different considerations that arise in the administration of criminal justice. In Carroll Gaudron and Gummow JJ said at [73]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The power to stay is said to be discretionary. In this context, the word ‘discretionary’ indicates that, although there are some clear categories, the circumstances in which proceedings will constitute an abuse of process cannot be exhaustively defined and, in some cases, minds may differ as to whether they do constitute an abuse. It does not indicate that there is a discretion to refuse a stay if proceedings are an abuse of process or to grant one if they are not…………..” 
        
       
      
    69 However, the ultimate question is one of determining whether it is in the public interest generally that the trial of the accused proceed or that the Crown be restrained from exercising its right to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court by the presentation of an indictment. The exercise of the Court’s power to restrain the Crown is an exceptional one and should only be exercised where the accused has proved to the Court that there is no other procedure open to cure the unfairness or prejudice said to arise from the delay in the commencement of proceedings. 
     
      
    70 The accused accepts that delay of itself will not generally be sufficient to warrant the court staying a prosecution even thought the length of delay is relevant to the issue of oppression. I have already noted that the accused does not assert impropriety on the part of the police or the Director. There is no suggestion that the initial investigation was incompetent, although the fresh evidence is criticised on the basis that it would have been available at the time of the initial investigation if the right questions had been asked of witnesses or had it been thought that further expert evidence was required. The submission was made that the Crown was little better off in terms of available evidence than it was at the time the decision was made to proceed only on the killing of Christopher. 
     
      
       
        
        The fresh evidence 
        
       
      
    71 The probative value of the fresh evidence relied upon by the Crown to justify the present proceeding is a relevant consideration in determining whether it would be so oppressive to the accused to put him to trial for the murder of his parents that the Court should not permit it to take place. So too is the fact, if it be the fact, that the evidence could reasonably have been available, when proceedings were originally commenced against the accused, had the matter been fully investigated. But in my opinion there is no basis for determining the issues raised by the application for a stay of the indictment simply on the basis that the evidence does not come up to the standard required under the provisions of the Crimes Appeal and Review Act. 
     
      
    72 In any event I am not persuaded that the fresh evidence is of little weight or importance so that it could not justify the decision of the Director now to commence proceedings against the accused. As I have made clear the Crown case is a circumstantial one, and, therefore, it is erroneous to consider each piece of fresh evidence alone and determine its probative value or significance without regard to the whole of the evidence now available to the prosecution. For example, the evidence as to the wetness of the accused’s hair may by itself seem trivial and of little evidentiary value. The accused submitted that it went only to a “subsidiary issue” and therefore was not substantial. I am not certain that in a circumstantial case any particular piece of evidence can be relegated to a “subsidiary issue” or be considered as being not substantial simply because it does not of itself prove the guilt of the accused. 
     
      
    73 The evidence as to the state of the accused’s hair is only one of a number of matters that the Crown relies upon to prove that the accused’s version in the recorded interview could not possibly be true. If used as one of a number of circumstances to prove the Crown’s case, it does not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and, therefore, the reliability of the evidence is not as crucial as it might have been had the onus of proof been higher. 
     
      
    74 Similarly the evidence of the tape recording may not satisfy the criterion for fresh evidence under the Crimes Appeal and Review Act but I do not accept the submission that it has no probative value. On its face it goes generally to the relationship between the accused, his parents and his brother and is a piece of circumstantial evidence. Because it was made some years before the killings, it might not have high probative value but it does not mean that it should be discarded from consideration when determining whether the prosecutor was unjustified in commencing the present proceedings. I should make it clear that I am not deciding whether the evidence should be admitted at the trial, I am merely considering the fresh evidence as a whole in considering whether the commencement of the proceedings should be considered to be unjustified. 
     
      
    75 The fact that fresh evidence now relied upon by the Crown might have been obtained at the first investigation is relevant to the issue of oppression but again it is not, in my opinion, decisive, particularly in the absence of any suggestion that the original investigation was incompetent or that there is anything improper in the way that the police or the Director has proceeded to this point. 
     
      
       
        
        Lost evidence 
        
       
      
    76 The following is evidence that has been lost probably as a result of the Crown accepting the plea and the early determination of the first coronial inquest: 
     
      
       
        
        Primary 
        
       
      
    · The knife said to have been used in the killings.· The bloodstained shave coat that the deceased, Christopher Gilham, was wearing at the time of his death.· The clothing allegedly worn by Jeffrey Gilham at the time of the killings.· The carpet samples from the living room of the house that were tested for accelerant.· Swatches of textile removed from Christopher Gilham’s shave coat for forensic testing.· Swabs that were forwarded to the Analytical Laboratories for analysis. 
     
      
       
        
        Secondary 
        
       
      
    · A washing basket (found in the room that Christopher Gilham was located in) which contained: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            A knife; 
            
           
           A mug (receptacle); 
           
           Syringe; 
          
         
        
       
      
    · Panadol packet and Panadol tablets; 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    · Chemical residue found in the mug by police, which proved to be Panadol. 
     
      
    77 Further there was a lack of testing done on some items, mainly because at the time DNA testing was in its infancy. So the knife found near the body of the accused’s brother and said to be the murder weapon was never tested for DNA or blood. However, it appeared to be clean of blood and had no fingerprints. The shower cubicle and bathroom drains and basins were not tested for blood or DNA. No carpet samples were tested for blood. 
     
      
    78 Although some testing was carried out on Christopher Gilham’s shave coat, the blood group found was consistent with his and his mother’s blood but not with his father’s blood. The Crown would contend that the failure to further analyse the shave coat for DNA and the inability to do so now, is of little relevance. It is apparent from the photograph that the visible blood appears to be in the position proximate to the stab wounds to his body. It was submitted by the Crown that, if further testing located blood from the mother, this would not necessarily be inconsistent with a transfer of blood from the knife used to kill the mother. It was submitted that the jury could not speculate about the absence of the shave coat or the lack of further testing but that the absence of evidence could not advance the Crown case. 
     
      
    79 It is clear that a trial can be rendered unfair and hence the prosecution an abuse of process where evidence has been lost by reason of delay or otherwise. A number of cases were referred to on behalf of the accused in various jurisdictions where stays of proceedings have been granted on this basis. There was no case placed before me of a stay having been granted in this State on the basis of lost evidence. There are decisions that have held that the loss of a potential witness does not necessarily justify a stay: R v Adler (NSWCCA, unreported, 11 June 1992) the loss of defence witness corroborating the accused, R v Goldburg (NSWCCA, unreported, 23 February 1993) where an alibi witness was unavailable; R v VPH (NSWCCA, unreported, 4 March 1994) where the accused’s wife had died and thus could not give evidence of domestic arrangements at the relevant time; R v Tolmie (NSWCCA, unreported, 7 December 1994) where there was the loss of two prosecution witnesses. 
     
      
    80 A stay of an indictment is an extraordinary step that is to be exercised sparingly and with the utmost caution. It is the last resort to be taken by a court to protect an individual. This was made clear in Jago v District Court, see at 31 per Mason CJ and at 76 per Gaudron J. Whether a stay is the only available remedy depends upon a consideration of the significance of the lost evidence in the particular case and whether any direction can be given to a jury or any other power could be exercised by the trial judge to overcome such prejudice: R v RWO [2002] NSWCCA 133 at [68]. The accused has submitted that no direction could be given that would cure the unfairness derived from the loss of the evidence but I am not satisfied that this is so. 
     
      
    81 The courts in general are now familiar with lengthy delays and the resultant loss of evidence in child sexual assault cases. The loss of relevant evidence can in some cases be shown to be very significant. For example, the delay can mean that the accused is no longer able to ascertain whether he or she might have had available an alibi. Witnesses who might have been able to give relevant evidence might no longer have any or sufficient memory of events or might have died. Because of the delay there will have been no examination of the child and no opportunity to secure forensic evidence that might have been relevant to support or deny the child’s version of events. Prejudice has generally been presumed by delay even though the accused cannot show what the prejudice might have been. 
     
      
    82 But unfairness that might have been occasioned by delay including the loss of evidence has never to my knowledge resulted in a stay of proceedings of a child sexual case as an abuse of process. The courts have acted on the basis that a direction, known generally as a Longman direction, can sufficiently ensure a fair trial for the accused by informing the jury of the effects of delay and the consequence of it upon the accused’s ability to defend the charge. The court warns the jury of the need for caution to be applied when assessing the Crown case and before they convict the accused. In some cases it might be necessary to warn the jury that it may be dangerous to convict the accused by reason of the delay and its prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    83 I have some difficulty in appreciating why it would be that such a direction can be sufficient to address the loss of evidence in a sexual assault case but not in a case for some other offence and particularly where the accused is able with more certainty to indicate the exact evidence that has been lost and the specific unfairness that has been occasioned as a result. I can see nothing about the nature of a child sexual assault prosecution that intrinsically would suggest that the loss of evidence in such a case has less impact than in a prosecution of any other serious offence. Quite the contrary. In such a case it is almost inevitably the word of the complainant against that of the accused and evidence going to the credibility or reliability of the complainant would be crucial. 
     
      
    84 As I have already noted, the intended prosecution of the accused is a circumstantial case and the Crown is not relying upon the reliability of any particular witness to prove the charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Rather the prosecution would be attempting to prove that the account of the accused given at the time of the killings, or very shortly thereafter, could not possibly be true. To this extent the loss of evidence seems to me to have less impact than it might have. True it is that the defence might have used an exhibit now missing or tests carried out on those exhibits to bolster an inference that the accused’s account is true. But the Crown could not rely upon the absence of those exhibits or the lack of testing to support an inference that the accused account was false. This is where I believe that directions or warnings to a jury might be more effective than would be the case where, for example, a complainant in a sexual assault prosecution is an apparently credible and compelling witness. In such a case the jury might more easily be able to dismiss the significance of the lack of evidence in the face of a witness that they feel should be believed. 
     
      
    85 The accused complains that the Crown will rely upon evidence of experts who might, because of their expertise, be considered favourably by the jury and yet the accused will not be able to cross-examine them effectively because the exhibits upon which they will express opinions have been lost. The accused is not now in a position to have the exhibits tested by his own experts. But I am not satisfied that this is a matter that cannot be addressed by suitable directions emphasising the lost opportunity of the accused to test the evidence. In any event it appears to me that what the accused has lost is a chance that he might have been able to present evidence that would weigh against the Crown case that his version of the events was false. He has lost an avenue of inquiry, or avenues of inquiry, that may have had a beneficial impact upon his defence: R v Helmling (NCWCCA, unreported, 11 November 1993). That is a matter that appears to me to be appropriately dealt with by directions from the trial judge. 
     
      
    86 In R v Slattery [2002] NSWCCA 367 the rifle used in the commission of a shooting offence had been destroyed before defence experts could examine it. The Court of Criminal Appeal set aside the verdict because of a failure of the trial judge to give an adequate warning to the jury, drawing their attention to the possible prejudice to the accused by the inability of the defence to examine the weapon. But there is nothing in the judgment to suggest that, had such a warning been given, the trial would necessarily have been unfair such that the verdict would have been quashed. 
     
      
    87 What this decision highlights is the benefit of being able to see with clarity the prejudice to the accused having regard to the evidence actually given at the trial and how, if possible, that might be addressed in light of submissions made to the jury. Otherwise the court in deciding whether there would be such unfairness as to render a trial an abuse of process is left to speculate about the evidence to be led at the trial and to make decisions based upon assertions that might not prove accurate when the issues in the trial are clearly established. This emphasises in my mind the exceptional step of granting a stay on the basis of lost evidence. 
     
      
    88 Crispin J in the Supreme Court of the ACT was somewhat dismissive of Slattery in R v Griffin [2006] ACTSC 77 and, with respect, was in my view too willing to assume that a direction or warning to a jury could not address the prejudice suffered by the accused from the loss of physical evidence before examination by a defence expert. But in any event that was a factual decision based upon facts different to those in the present case. Further it was a decision made by a single judge on an issue upon which minds might reasonably differ. In that case the police lost the evidence while the prosecution was on foot and while it was in their custody. That was a matter that was seen to be of relevance to the decision even though it was not asserted that it had been lost deliberately. In that case, unlike this, no expert had examined the missing object. 
     
      
    89 None of the individual cases relied upon by the applicant establish any principle that might guide me in determining the question whether the proposed trial of the accused would be so unfair by reason of the loss of the exhibits that a stay of the prosecution is warranted. They each depend to a very large extent upon their own facts. For example in Holmden v Bitar (1987) 47 SASR 509 the defendant had the onus of proof in a quarantine offence where the items imported had been destroyed. In Duncombe –Wall v Police [1998] SASC 6754 there was a major issue as to credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the missing evidence might have been crucial to resolve that issue. In R v Davis (1995) 57 FCR 512 the evidence lost was contemporaneous notes made by the accused of medical examinations of the complainants in a sexual assault case without which it was impossible for him to remember the particular consultation about which the complaint was made. 
     
      
    90 However, what the cases emphasise is that it is for the accused to prove that the trial would be so unfair as to require a stay and that such an onus is not easily satisfied given the exceptional nature of the remedy. 
     
      
    91 It has been made clear that a fair trial does not mean a trial that is as fair as it could possibly be. The question is whether the trial would be rendered unfair when judged by “acceptable standards of justice” Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 97. In Jago v The District Court (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 33 Mason CJ said:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “The test of fairness which must be applied involves a balancing process, for the interests of the accused cannot be considered in isolation without regard to the community’s right to expect that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial: see Barton (CLR at 102, 106); Sang, at 437 Carver v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 29 A Crim R 24 at 31 and 32. At the same time, it should not be overlooked that the community expects trials to be fair and to take place within a reasonable time after a person has been charged … 
        
       
      
    92 It is not difficult to conjure up examples of trials where, even without delay, a witness or a particular piece of evidence is for some reason no longer available and yet the trial would not be relevantly unfair such that it should be stayed. Of course the situation might be different if the prosecution had recklessly destroyed evidence even though they were aware that there was to be a defended hearing, they were put on notice of the importance of the evidence and where that evidence might have assisted the accused: see Duncombe – Wall. But there is no such allegation here. 
     
      
    93 To some extent the accused is in a better position than many accused who face trial after long delay or where evidence has become unavailable. His version of events has been preserved and is accessible in a recorded interview. As I have indicated, the Crown will have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the version he gave shortly after the incident is not true. To that extent the accused is less prejudiced by the passage of time even if he has tried to put the events of the night from his memory. 
     
      
    94 Further, it should be borne in mind that the result of a refusal to grant a stay does not mean that the accused is without a remedy, if the trial proves to be unfair notwithstanding steps taken by the trial judge to remove that unfairness. It is not unknown for a trial judge to make a decision based upon a forecast of what might occur during a trial or based upon facts and circumstances as they appear to be at the time the decision is made, and yet that forecast proves to have been based upon a false assumption or that the facts or circumstances change significantly during the course of the trial. The trial judge can revisit decisions, such as the refusal to order a separate trial, on the basis of what occurs through the trial. The Court of Criminal Appeal can review such a decision made at the start of the trial if it proves that a miscarriage of justice has ultimately eventuated. This is what occurred in one of the authorities relied upon by the accused, R v Garjee an unreported decision of the English Court of Appeal dated 20 September 1994. 
     
      
    95 In the present case I suggested that the prosecutor might indicate what submission the Crown might make to the jury at any trial in light of the missing exhibits so that a more realistic appraisal might be made of the claim of prejudice by the accused. Ultimately that did not transpire. But it seems to me at this stage that the trial judge can deal with the issue of lost evidence by warnings or directions depending upon how the case develops before the jury and what submissions the Crown ultimately makes. Certainly I am not presently persuaded that the trial judge, by appropriate warnings or directions, rulings on admissibility or other orders, cannot cure any prejudice suffered by the accused, particularly having regard to the fact that it is a circumstantial case and that the Crown must prove that the accused’s version cannot reasonably be true. 
     
      
       
      Double Jeopardy 
      
    96 A significant issue that arose on the hearing of this application is the question of double jeopardy arising from the fact that the accused was indicted for the murder of his brother but convicted, after a plea of guilty, of the offence of manslaughter. There are a number of aspects in which double jeopardy can impact upon the decision whether to stay the present indictment. As was pointed out in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [9] the term “double jeopardy” has shades of meaning and impacts in various ways upon the prosecution of accused persons. In the joint judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ it was stated (footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The expression 'double jeopardy' is not always used with a single meaning. Sometimes it is used to refer to the pleas in bar of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict; sometimes it is used to encompass what is said to be a wider principle that no one should be 'punished again for the same matter'. Further, 'double jeopardy' is an expression that is employed in relation to several different stages of the criminal justice process: prosecution, conviction and punishment."" 
        
       
      
    97 In Island Maritime Ltd v Filipowski [2006] HCA 30;(2006) 80 ALJR 1168 Gummow and Hayne JJ stated at [41] (footnotes not reproduced): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “’Double jeopardy’ is an expression that is not always used with a single meaning. It is an expression used in relation to several different stages of the process of criminal justice: prosecution, conviction and punishment. It describes values which underpin a number of aspects of the criminal law, rather than a rule that can be stated as the premise for deductive reasoning. The essence of these values is most often seen as captured in three maxims: interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium (it is in society's interest that there be an end to litigation), res judicata pro veritate accipitur (what is adjudicated is taken as the truth), and nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa (no one should twice be vexed for one and the same cause). It is these values that underpin the rule that evidence is inadmissible where, if accepted, it would overturn or tend to overturn an acquittal. It is these values that inform the rules governing successive prosecutions — rules which find their origins in the pleas in bar of autrefois convict and autrefois acquit but now have wider application than those pleas in bar.” 
        
       
      
    98 It has been held that the principle of double jeopardy has four major rationales: the imbalance of power between the prosecution and the accused; the seriousness of conviction; the avoidance of oppression of the individual by the power of the executive; and to ensure finality of proceedings. And yet those considerations must be balanced against the recognition that those who are guilty of criminal behaviour should be prosecuted for it: Carroll per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at [23]. It was acknowledged by their Honours that there may be cases where the competing interests pull in different directions and a balance needs to be struck between them. 
     
      
    99 Some of the aspects of double jeopardy will be considered on the issue of whether the proceedings would be oppressive by reason of multiple prosecutions. But before considering the issue of double jeopardy as a legal impediment to the further prosecution of the accused, it is necessary firstly to consider the legal consequence of what occurred before Mr Justice Abadee when the plea to manslaughter was accepted in full discharge of the indictment and the accused was sentenced for that offence. 
     
      
       
        
        The legal consequence of accepting the plea 
        
       
      
    100 At the time of the plea, the relevant provision concerned with the acceptance of a plea to an alternative count not charged in the indictment was s 394A of the Crimes Act. The section has been repealed and replaced by s 153 of the Criminal Procedure Act. At the relevant time s 394A was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Where a prisoner is arraigned on an indictment for any offence and can lawfully be convicted on such indictment of some other offence not charged in such indictment, he may plead not guilty of the offence charged on the indictment, but guilty of such other offence, and the Crown may elect to accept such plea of guilty or may require the trial to proceed upon the charge upon which the prisoner is arraigned.” 
        
       
      
    101 The consequence of the procedure adopted under s 394A was considered in R v Maxwell (1994) 34 NSWLR 606. That was a case concerned with the power of a judge to reject a plea of manslaughter accepted by the Crown on an indictment for murder. There a judge had rejected a plea of guilty to manslaughter, by what was then known as diminished responsibility, accepted by the Crown in discharge of an indictment for murder on the basis that the evidence tendered did not support the defence of diminished responsibility. The accused appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the rejection of the plea, arguing that the trial judge had no power to take that course. In dismissing the appeal Gleason CJ, with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Badgery-Parker J agreed, stated (at 614) (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Section 394A was introduced into the Crimes Act 1900 of New South Wales at a time when it was generally assumed that a trial judge had a discretion to refuse to accept a plea of guilty. Furthermore, in a case where s 394A is invoked, the consideration which so influenced the court in R v Naraindeen is present.  
        What is involved is not only a conviction of the lesser charge but also an acquittal of the more serious charge 
        . Although the section speaks in terms of the decision to accept a plea of guilty being made by the Crown, rather than the court, it is not in terms inconsistent with the existence of a discretion in the court, and in my view there is such a discretion. I would not construe the legislation as intending to take it away. Thus, for practical purposes I would give the section substantially the same operation as the Canadian provision which was considered in R v Naraindeen.” 
        
       
      
    102 The reference to R v Naraindeen is a reference to a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario at (1990) 75 OR (2d) 120. That case was concerned with s 606(4) of the Canadian Criminal Code, a section similar to s 394A but in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, where an accused or defendant pleads not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of any other offence arising out of the same transaction, whether or not it is an included offence, the court may, with the consent of the prosecutor, accept that plea of guilty and, if such plea is accepted, the court shall find the accused or the defendant not guilty of the offence charged and find him guilty of the offence in respect of which the plea of guilty was accepted and enter those findings in the record of the court."" 
        
       
      
    103 Notwithstanding the fact that this provision expressly required the court, on accepting the plea, to both convict of the lesser offence and acquit of the more serious charge, Gleeson CJ interpreted s 394A to the same effect, that is that the acceptance of the plea to the less serious charge carried with it both a conviction on that charge and an acquittal on the more serious charge. It was the resultant acquittal that, in the Chief Justice’s opinion, supported the existence of a discretion in the trial judge to reject the plea of guilty if the evidence proffered in support of the less serious charge was inconsistent with an acquittal of the more serious charge. 
     
      
    104 Counsel for the accused before me relied heavily upon the sentence underlined in the first passage that I have quoted in support of the application for a stay on the basis that the accused was, by reason of the acceptance of the plea of guilty to manslaughter, taken to have been acquitted of the murder of his brother. It was argued, relying upon a line of authority commencing with Mraz v The Queen (No 2) (1956) 96 CLR 62, that the Crown could not conduct a prosecution of any charge that called into question this acquittal. It was submitted that on a trial for the murder of the accused’s parents the jury would have to be directed that they were to give full effect to the acquittal of the charge of murdering his brother but, on the facts in this case, that could only mean that they must acquit the accused of the murder of his parents. 
     
      
    105 Further, it was argued that any verdict of guilty of murder of the parents must be factually inconsistent with a verdict of acquittal of the murder of his brother, because as a matter of logic it must follow from a finding that the accused murdered his parents that he also murdered his brother. It was submitted that such inconsistent verdicts would bring the system of justice into disrepute and give rise to an abuse of the Court’s process. 
     
      
    106 At the hearing of the application and without having been taken to the actual decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, I expressed some surprise at the notion that the accused had been acquitted of the charge of murder in respect of his brother. I pointed out to counsel that there was no formal entry of an acquittal on the Court record, that is on the indictment presented before Mr Justice Abadee, and I thought that the decision of the Crown was akin to a nolle prosequi on the charge of murder. However, in response it was submitted that I was bound by the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal as it was part of the ratio of that decision and, further, that certain judges in the High Court had adopted a similar view in determining an appeal from the decision in R v Maxwell. 
     
      
    107 In Maxwell v The Queen [1995] HCA 62; (1996) 184 CLR 501 the accused appealed against the Court of Criminal Appeal’s determination that the trial judge had power to reject the plea of guilty against the wishes of the parties. The Court, by majority, allowed the appeal and held that the trial judge did not have that power. The four majority judges had cause to consider the effect of s 394A. 
     
      
    108 Justices McHugh and Dawson wrote (at 511-512) (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        In this case, however, the appellant pleaded not guilty to murder, which was the offence with which he was charged, but guilty of manslaughter, an offence with which he was not charged. That course was sanctioned by s394A of the Crimes Act and, the prosecutor having elected to accept the plea of guilty, there was no basis upon which the plea could be treated otherwise than as if the accused had been charged with manslaughter and had pleaded guilty to that charge. Of course, had the prosecutor elected not to accept the plea of guilty of manslaughter, the trial of the accused for murder would have proceeded.  
        The practical effect of the prosecutor's acceptance of the plea of guilty to manslaughter was that he led no evidence upon the charge of murder in the indictment 
        . 
        
       
      
    109 Justices Gaudron and Gummow also considered the operation of the provision. At p 529 under the heading “Was the appellant convicted of manslaughter?” they stated (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        A conviction for a lesser offence than that contained in an indictment, as permitted by s394A of the Act, necessarily involves an acquittal on the offence charged in that indictment 
        . Accordingly, if the appellant was convicted of manslaughter when remanded in custody for sentence, he can rely on autrefois acquit and cannot now be required to stand trial for murder. It is, thus, convenient to first consider whether the appellant was convicted of manslaughter. 
        
       
      
    110 They later wrote (at 534) (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        A decision by a prosecutor to accept a plea to a lesser charge, as permitted by s394A of the Act, is a decision not to proceed, or, more precisely, not to present evidence on the more serious charge in the indictment and, at the same time, a decision as to the charge which is to proceed 
        . It is insusceptible of judicial review. Subject to two qualifications, judicial review is precisely what is involved in a court's rejection of a plea which has been accepted under s394A of the Act. And that is so whether or not the prosecutor invites or acquiesces in its rejection. Indeed, it may be that the impartiality of the judicial process is brought more directly into question by a decision at the behest or with the consent of a prosecutor that a plea previously accepted by the prosecutor should be rejected. 
        
       
      
    111 It seems to me, and contrary to the submission made on behalf of the accused, that a majority of the High Court did not hold that the acceptance of the plea of guilty resulted in an acquittal of the accused of the more serious offence. However, in light of the views expressed in the Court of Criminal Appeal and by Justices Gaudron and Gummow, I should find that the acceptance of the plea to manslaughter resulted in a decision by the Crown not to lead evidence on the charge of murder and, as a consequence, there was in effect an acquittal of the charge of murder. 
     
      
       
      Fact finding where a plea of guilty accepted by Crown 
      
    112 It will be noted from the facts as tendered that the basis of the plea of guilty was not that the Crown was asserting that the accused was provoked into killing his brother, but rather that the Crown was unable to prove that he was not provoked. It is trite that, where there is evidence of provocation fit to go to a jury, the Crown must prove to the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person was not provoked into killing the deceased before the jury can convict of murder. In the present case the statement of facts placed before the Judge displayed a clear acknowledgment of the onus and standard of proof. It contained an opinion of the police officer that the accused’s version, that he was provoked by the killing of his parents by his brother, was feasible and that there was no evidence available to refute it. The statement of the prosecutor, which I set out earlier in this judgment, was not an assertion of the facts accepted by the Crown but rather an answer to the Judge’s enquiry as to the basis upon which the plea to manslaughter was being accepted. In my opinion the acceptance of the plea was merely an acknowledgment by the Crown that it could not prove that the accused did not kill his brother under provocation. 
     
      
    113 Of course the Judge sentenced the accused on the basis that he was provoked according to his version of events. But that does not mean that the Judge found that version to be the true facts. A sentencing judge is obliged to sentence in accordance with material placed before the court, and, if there had been a jury verdict, in accordance with that verdict notwithstanding that the judge may not agree with it. In Maxwell v The Queen (at 514) McHugh and Dawson JJ said this about sentencing after the acceptance of a plea to manslaughter on an indictment for murder (footnotes not included): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “………….[McInerney J] rejected the appellant's plea of guilty in the exercise of a discretion which he believed he had but which, in our view, he did not have. Moreover, he appears to have done so in the belief that, notwithstanding the acceptance of the plea of guilty to manslaughter upon the basis of diminished responsibility, it was the duty of the prosecution to establish to his satisfaction that the accused was suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts. Upon the plea being accepted by the prosecution, the diminished responsibility of the accused was no longer an issue and the judge was required to approach the task of sentencing the accused accordingly. Whether McInerney J himself thought that the material placed before him was insufficient to establish diminished responsibility was no more relevant than is the view of a trial judge who disagrees with the verdict of a jury but is nevertheless required to sentence upon the basis of that verdict. In R v De Simoni Gibbs CJ pointed out that a sentencing judge may be required by reason of the charge selected by the prosecution to take an artificially restricted view of the facts. He said: 
         
         
          
          ‘This will be so also in cases where the jury's verdict is inconsistent with the view of the facts that the judge himself has formed, for the judge cannot act on a view of the facts which conflicts with the jury's verdict. However, where the Crown has charged the offender with, or has accepted a plea of guilty to, an offence less serious than the facts warrant, it cannot rely, or ask the judge to rely, on the facts that would have rendered the offender liable to a more serious penalty.’ 
          
         
         
        In sentencing the accused, McInerney J was required to proceed upon the basis that, in killing his wife, the accused's mental responsibility for his acts was substantially impaired by reason of an abnormality of mind, notwithstanding any reservations which he may have entertained had the matter been one for his decision.” 
        
       
      
    114 Where there has been a trial by jury, the trial judge is required to find facts in accordance with the jury verdict and consistent with the offence of which the accused has been convicted. But apart from these limitations, the trial judge is completely at liberty to find all facts in accordance with the evidence and to the relevant standard of proof: facts adverse to the accused must be found beyond reasonable doubt: Chow v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 593. But the finding of facts after a plea of guilty will usually be restricted by the material placed before the court, often being merely an agreed statement of facts: see R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; (2002) 134 A Crim R 174. 
     
      
    115 In the present case there was no scope for Abadee J to find any facts other than those that were agreed between the parties notwithstanding that he was not restricted to the agreed statement of facts because other material was tendered to him. But that further material did not impact upon the facts set out in the agreed statement. 
     
      
    116 The status of sentencing remarks and the effect they have on subsequent proceedings has been subject to some consideration. In Walton v Butler [2004] QCA 465; (2004) 150 A Crim R 341 the question arose as to whether the sentencing of the offender in the Supreme Court of Queensland in respect of the possession of cannabis found in the offender’s premises gave rise to an issue estoppel for the purposes of a confiscation order sought in the Magistrate’s Court in respect of money found in the same premises. The Supreme Court Judge when sentencing the offender for possession of the drugs stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “……..it is common ground that I am to deal with you upon the basis that you had possession of 638 grams of cannabis sativa for your personal use. Given that is so, it is, I think, appropriate that I make a non-custodial order, as has been proposed by your counsel, and I propose to do so.” 
        
       
       
      The offender later sought to resist the confiscation of the money on the basis that it was not “tainted” because it could not be found to have been derived from the sale of cannabis given the finding of the sentencing judge. In effect it was submitted that the prosecution was estopped from submitting that the offender had been selling the cannabis found in the premises by reason of the agreed facts placed before the Supreme Court. 
       
      
    117 McPherson JA, delivering the principal judgment of the Queensland Court of Appeal, was prepared to assume that issue estoppel applied in the criminal law notwithstanding High Court authority to the contrary but held that it had no application to the confiscation proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court for a number of reasons, one being that the sentencing remarks did not give rise to a finding of fact that was in issue before the magistrate. McPherson JA held that the sentence was a judgment of the court for the application of the principles of issue estoppel. However, his Honour pointed out that the sentencing judge made no finding of fact but sentenced on the “common ground” between the parties. McPherson JA noted that in Queensland there was a statutory provision, s 132C of the Evidence Act 1977 (Qld), that provided for the effect of admissions in sentencing proceedings and then went on (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [14] In this instance, it is evident that Cullinane J in sentencing the applicant was in terms of s 132C(2) acting on an allegation of fact that was admitted by the Crown in those proceedings; namely, that the applicant had possession of the 638 grams of cannabis for his personal use. It was agreed upon by the representatives of the parties as the factual basis for the applicant's plea of guilty that followed. What it demonstrates is that there was here no judicial finding or determination of the fact that the applicant's possession of the cannabis was for his personal use. The making or existence of an agreement to that effect is quite inconsistent with the notion that any finding or determination about it was made judicially.  
        The learned judge simply acted, as s 132C(2) authorises him to do, on an allegation to that effect that was admitted by being agreed to by the Crown as the factual basis of the plea or agreement. Such an admission cannot be regarded as operating or extending beyond the sentencing proceeding or indictment 
         no SCR 7103 in R v Michael John Walton in the Supreme Court at Townsville. In particular, it does not prevent or estop the complainant Aaron Butler in the proceedings upon the third complaint before the magistrate at Bowen from adducing evidence about the discovery of the cannabis in the applicant's house in order, if he can, to support an inference that the amount of $15,555 also found there on 23 July 2002 might reasonably be suspected of being tainted property within the meaning of s 92(1) of the Crimes (Confiscation) Act 1989. 
        
       
      
    118 In that case the offence, with which the offender had been charged and to which he had pleaded guilty, was merely the possession of the drugs and said nothing about the purpose of that possession. Here the accused was charged with manslaughter and that offence says nothing about the nature of the killing other than that it was an unlawful homicide. The decision is authority for the proposition that there was no judgment of this Court determining that the manslaughter of which the accused was convicted was based upon provocation let alone that the provocation was the act of the accused’s brother in killing both parents. In other words Mr Justice Abadee did not determine as a fact that the accused’s brother killed his parents. 
     
      
    119 The effect of the conduct of the Crown in sentencing proceedings and whether it gives rise to any limitation on the conduct of the Crown in subsequent proceedings was considered in R v K; Ex parte Attorney General (QLD) [2002] QCA 260; (2002) 132 A Crim R 108. That case concerned a prosecution of the parents of a child, S, for injuries inflicted on the child. There were a number of charges relating to different injuries and the father and mother were jointly charged with each offence. However, the Crown alleged that the mother was the person solely responsible for the infliction of the injuries to S. After trial the father was acquitted but the mother was convicted of some charges.  
     
      
    120 At the trial the Crown relied upon similar fact evidence against the mother. This evidence related to a female child born to the mother of a man who was not the father of S. That child suffered injuries similar to those inflicted upon S. The mother had been charged with inflicting the injuries to that child. She pleaded guilty to two charges and the Crown accepted those pleas in full discharge of the indictment. The Crown had accepted for the purpose of sentencing that the mother had shaken the child in an effort to revive her, after she had choked when feeding, in order to avert a risk of her death by suffocation. In other words the Crown accepted that the injuries were inflicted accidentally. The evidence of her inflicting injuries on that child was admitted to rebut a possible defence of accident to account for the injuries to S. 
     
      
    121 On appeal against conviction the mother argued that it was not open to the Crown at the trial to depart from the factual basis that had been agreed at the sentencing in respect of the other child. In particular it was argued that the Crown could not allege at the trial that the injuries were inflicted upon the child intentionally when that was not the basis upon which the mother had been sentenced. In rejecting that argument McPherson JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed on this point, stated (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [18]………….No question of issue estoppel arises in criminal proceedings: see Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251; nor does any question of autrefois acquit or double jeopardy arise in this case: see R v Degnan [2001] 1 NZLR 280; and Carroll (2000) 115 A Crim R 164. Once his Honour Judge Noud accepted the plea of guilty by [the mother] on 16 April 1999, it operated as a conviction or judgment of her guilt in respect of the charges to which she pleaded: Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501, 508. The same cannot, however, be said of the facts on which the sentencing process took place. In any event, in adducing evidence at the S trial of the injuries inflicted on her daughter and of their likely cause, the prosecution was not seeking to set aside that conviction or to increase the penalty imposed for the offence for which [the mother] was sentenced on that occasion; which is not to say that, if misrepresentation were proved to have taken place at the sentencing hearing, it would not have been open to the Crown to set aside the sentence and substitute another and heavier one. See R v Beldan, ex p Attorney-General [1986] 2 Qd R 179, recently applied in DPP v Burgess [2001] 3 VR 363. 
         
         
        [19] The offence to which [the mother] pleaded was occasioning bodily harm to her daughter, which is an offence into which intention does not enter as an ingredient. Complete absence of intention to cause harm is, however, capable of going some way in mitigation of the offence when it comes to imposing a sentence.  
        The fact that the Crown was induced or disposed to accept [the mother’s] explanation for her daughter's injuries for the purpose of sentencing in April 1999 avoided the need for an inquiry or determination by the Court to establish the truth of the matter. It was simply an assumption which, in the absence of cogent evidence to the contrary, the Crown was prepared to accept, and on which the Court acted, on that occasion for the purpose of sentencing [the mother] following her plea of guilty. It represented no obstacle to proof by the prosecution at the S trial that that assumption, as it turned out, may have been unfounded in fact or untrue. 
         In my opinion, the similar fact evidence was both admissible and rightly admitted at the trial of [the mother]. Had it been rejected, a serious injustice might have been done to [the father]…………. 
        
       
      
    122 Upon this authority it seems to me that the Crown would not be impeded at a trial of the accused for the murder of his parents from asserting that he did not kill his brother under the effects of provocation as a result of the brother killing his parents. Clearly the factual situation here is not on all fours with that decided in R v K because there is still the conviction of manslaughter. But the Crown is not bound by any agreement as to the factual basis for the manslaughter conviction. It is enough that the Crown prove to the jury, that for whatever reason the accused killed his brother, it was not because the brother had killed his parents. 
     
      
       
        
        The effect of the acquittal of murder 
        
       
      
    123 In the present proceedings Abadee J made no finding of facts. That situation should be contrasted with that in Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251. In that case there was a finding that the relevant records of interview were not voluntary: a ruling made after a contested hearing before the trial judge. That finding was incontrovertible at least once a verdict of acquittal had been returned and could not later be challenged by the Crown. It was a positive finding made by the trial judge and, therefore, there was an abuse of process for the Crown to attempt to relitigate the issue: Carroll at [46], [91] and [136]. In my view the only incontrovertible or final finding in the present case is that the accused was guilty of the manslaughter of his brother. 
     
      
    124 It may well be the case, as the Crown conceded before me, that, had the accused been convicted of manslaughter after trial, the situation would have been different. For one thing there would then clearly have been an acquittal of the charge of murdering his brother recorded as the verdict of the court. It may well be the case that had the only basis for manslaughter left to the jury been provocation, a verdict by the jury finding the accused guilty of manslaughter might have inhibited the Crown from asking a second jury to find facts inconsistent with that verdict. But that is not what happened in this case. 
     
      
    125 The Crown, as in R v K, was prepared to accept, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the factual situation that the accused killed his brother under the effects of provocation and there was hence no occasion for the sentencing court to inquire into or establish what was “the truth of the matter”, to borrow that expression from R v K. I do not see why the Crown cannot at a later trial seek to show that the facts were different from those it was prepared to accept at the sentencing hearing where it conceded that it could not disprove the contrary of those facts. This is in effect what the Crown did in R v K. 
     
      
    126 True it is that the accused has been convicted of manslaughter of his brother, but the Crown is not seeking to interfere with that conviction. Nor is it seeking to have the accused convicted of any other offence in respect of the death of his brother. The accused is not being placed in double jeopardy in respect of the death of his brother. There is no question of a plea of autrefois arising nor is there a plea in bar available as a result of the conviction for manslaughter that impact upon this particular prosecution. The fact that the Crown accepted a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the basis of provocation and was prepared to accept that the brother had killed his parents is a matter that may impact upon the jury’s preparedness to find the contrary beyond reasonable doubt. But that is in my view the only relevance of the sentencing proceedings and the conviction of the accused for manslaughter of his brother. 
     
      
    127 However the question arises as to whether the acquittal of the charge of murder of his brother arising from the acceptance of the plea to manslaughter would require that the trial be stayed so as not to breach the principle against double jeopardy. Clearly the killing of the brother occurred as part of the series of events that also resulted in the death of the parents. The facts surrounding the killing are intertwined. The killing of the parents could not sensibly be considered without a consideration of the killing of the brother. By asking the jury to find that the accused killed the parents, is the Crown seeking to call into question the acquittal for the murder of the brother such that it offends double jeopardy? Would the trial judge need to direct the jury that they must give the acquittal of the murder of the brother full weight? Would such a direction mean that the jury could not do so and yet convict the accused of the murder of his parents? 
     
      
    128 The decisions that have held that the prosecution cannot seek to call into question an acquittal are cases where the later prosecution relates to a further allegation in respect of the same victim. They raise the issue of double jeopardy clearly because the prosecution is attempting to secure a conviction directly contrary to an issue that has been determined by the previous acquittal. However it is of crucial significance in my view that in each case the acquittal was a result of a jury verdict after trial. 
     
      
    129 In Mraz (No 2) the prosecution was attempting to secure a conviction for rape of the victim of the charge of murder for which the accused had been acquitted by a jury. The jury had convicted the accused of manslaughter but that conviction was set aside by the High Court: see (1955) 93 CLR 493. It was held that the acquittal of murder read with the conviction of manslaughter meant that the jury must have found that the accused had not raped the victim. Therefore, the prosecution was bound by the acquittal and could not retry the charge of rape. 
     
      
    130 In Garrett v The Queen (1977) 139 CLR 437 the accused had been acquitted of a charge of rape against the complainant. He was later charged with another rape of the same complainant and the prosecution led evidence of the prior allegation as part of the relationship between the accused and the complainant. Evidence of the complainant in the later trial, that she did not consent to the earlier act of intercourse, was held to be inadmissible because it called into question the earlier acquittal of the jury. 
     
      
    131 In The Queen v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364 the evidence concerned the alleged abduction of the complainant on a charge of rape. A jury had acquitted the accused of the charge of abduction and the question was whether the evidence of what happened at the time of the alleged abduction could be admitted on the hearing of the charge of rape. One of the difficulties averted to by Barwick CJ was that the jury acquittal of the charge of abduction did not indicate what fact the jury had found. The relevance of a prior acquittal was summarised by the Chief Justice as follows (at 372): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The correct principle relevant to the admissibility in a subsequent trial of evidence given in an earlier trial which has resulted in an acquittal is, in my opinion, no more than this: that a verdict of acquittal shall not be challenged in a subsequent trial: the accused in the hearing of a subsequent charge must be given the full benefit of his acquittal on the earlier occasion. Evidence which was admissible to establish the earlier offence is, in my opinion, not inadmissible merely because it was tendered in the earlier proceedings: but it may not be used for the purpose of challenging, or diminishing the benefit to the accused of, the acquittal. Such evidence will be admissible, provided it is relevant to the subsequent charge, or to a defence to it, but must only be allowed to be used to support that charge or negative a defence. Where evidence which would tend to prove the earlier charge or some element of it is admitted in the subsequent charge, the jury must be duly warned that they must accept the fact of the earlier acquittal and not use the evidence in any wise to reconsider the guilt of the accused of the earlier offence or to question or discount the effect of the acquittal.” 
        
       
       
      Later the Chief Justice went on to state: 
       
        
         
        “But the citizen must not be twice put in jeopardy, that is to say, as relevant to the present discussion, must not be placed at the risk of being thought guilty of an offence of which he has been acquitted, or of in any sense being treated as guilty. It is the use of the evidence given on the prior occasion to canvass the acquittal which, if allowed, would offend the rule against double jeopardy, giving that rule a generous application. The principle that the accused in the subsequent trial must be given the full benefit of the acquittal thus might be regarded as akin to, but not a mere extrapolation of, the principle of autrefois acquit, both being grounded upon the protection of the law against double jeopardy. But, to my mind, they are distinct principles. In my opinion, the remarks of Lord MacDermott in Sambasivam v Public Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya [1950] AC 458, sufficiently established the basic principle though, as I have indicated, I would take the reference to res judicata to be confined to the fact of acquittal and not to extend to any fact supposedly found or denied in arriving at that verdict.” 
        
       
      
    132 In Carroll the prosecution was in effect attempting to relitigate the issue of whether the accused had killed the victim by charging him with perjury. A jury had previously acquitted the accused of murder. To establish the charge of perjury the prosecution had to prove that the accused killed the victim. The focus of both prosecutions was the one and same fact: did he kill the victim? 
     
      
    133 Gleeson CJ and Hayne J thought that the abuse of process involved in the prosecution for perjury was a manifest inconsistency between the acquittal for murder and the conviction for perjury at [42]. The principle behind the stay of the prosecution for perjury was the need to preserve the incontrovertibility of the acquittal of murder. Theirs Honours stated at [45]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The need for decisions of the courts, unless set aside or quashed, to be accepted as incontrovertibly correct is a principle which requires that it is the verdict of acquittal which should be incontrovertible. It is not necessary in this case to attempt to decide what may be the limits of the principle about incontrovertibility and, in any event, it would be unwise to attempt to do so. It is a proposition which has not been held to preclude persons other than the prosecution asserting in later proceedings that the person committed the crime of which he or she was acquitted at trial……..” 
        
       
      
    134 In Rogers incontrovertibility was conferred on a finding made by a trial judge after a hearing on the merits of an issue in respect of which he was the tribunal with jurisdiction to determine that question. The decision that the records of interview were not voluntary became incontrovertible after the verdict of acquittal was entered. It was held that to permit another judge to make a contrary finding on the same issue resulted in an abuse of process because it tended to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
     
      
    135 These decisions have in common the fact that there is a verdict or ruling made on the merits. They apply, or are consistent with, the classical statement of the incontrovertibility of an acquittal by Lord MacDermott in Sambasivan v Public Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya [1950] AC 458. His Lordship stated at 479 (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The effect of a verdict of acquittal  
        pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial 
         is not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the adjudication. The maxim ‘res judicata pro veritate accipitur’ is no less applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings. Here, the appellant having been acquitted at the first trial on the charge of having ammunition in his possession, the prosecution was bound to accept the correctness of that verdict and was precluded from taking any step to challenge it at the second trial. And the appellant was no less entitled to rely on his acquittal in so far as it might be relevant in his defence. That it was not conclusive of his innocence on the firearm charge is plain, but it undoubtedly reduced in some degree the weight of the charge against him, for at the first trial the facts proved in support of one charge were clearly relevant to the other having regard to the circumstances in which the ammunition and revolver were found and the fact that they fitted each other.” 
        
       
      
    136 The effect of this statement and its applicability to a situation where the verdict of acquittal was not entered after a trial has been considered in two decisions in Victoria. In R v Calcedo [1986] VR 499 the accused was arraigned on a charge of malicious wounding and armed robbery arising from the one incident. He pleaded guilty to the robbery and the Crown led no evidence on the wounding charge. In accordance with s 391 of the Crimes Act (Vic) the judge directed a verdict of not guilty be entered on that charge. Later the accused was permitted to change his plea on the robbery charge. At the trial evidence was given of the wounding to the victim in reply to questions in cross-examination as to the complainant’s physical state. It was held that the evidence was not rendered inadmissible by the acquittal and nor was the trial judge required to bring the acquittal to the attention of the jury. It was noted that there was no trial and held that the earlier decisions to which I have referred were predicated on acquittal or conviction after trial by jury; see at 504. 
     
      
    137 Calcedo was considered in R v Young [1998] 1 VR 402. In that case there was a trial of the accused for indecent acts with young boys. The prosecution chose not to lead evidence on three counts and the accused was acquitted under s 391. However evidence of those incidents was led on the basis that such assaults had in fact occurred and upon which the jury could conclude that the accused had a “guilty passion” for the boy. On appeal the accused argued that the evidence on those counts should not have been admitted and the jury should have been directed as to the significance of the fact that the accused had been acquitted of charges relating to those incidents. 
     
      
       
      Section 391 was as follows: 
       
        
         
        ""If any person arraigned on any indictment or presentment pleads thereto 'Not Guilty, ' he shall without further form be deemed to have put himself upon the country for trial; and subject to s391A the jury for his trial shall in the usual manner be impanelled accordingly. Provided that where a person arraigned on any indictment or presentment pleads 'Not Guilty' to any count in respect of which the prosecutor for the Queen proposes not to lead evidence the prosecutor shall so inform the trial judge before a jury is impanelled and the trial judge shall thereupon direct that an entry of 'Not Guilty' be made upon the record in respect of such count and every such entry shall have effect as if it were the verdict of a jury upon the trial of the accused person on that count."" 
        
       
      
    138 The Court held that the only purpose of leading the evidence was to challenge the acquittal in order to show that the accused had been indecently assaulting the child otherwise the evidence was irrelevant. In respect of the decision in Calcedo the Court stated (at 418): 
     
      
       
        
         
        In so far as this judgment suggested that a verdict entered pursuant to s. 391 is not to be treated as having occurred upon trial of the accused, we cannot agree with his Honour's observations. Nor can we accept that the observations in Sambasivam's case and the principles exemplified thereby arise only if the verdict of acquittal follows a trial at which evidence is in fact adduced. The whole point of the proviso added to s. 391 is that the court, and the jury, should be spared the farce of calling such evidence as is available when the Crown has decided that there is insufficient evidence to justify a conviction. 
        
       
       
      The Court emphasised by underlining that part of the proviso that stated that the verdict was to have the effect “as if it were the verdict of jury upon the trial of the accused”. The judgement in  
      Calcedo 
       was explained by reason of “the difficulty in determining precisely what had been there resolved by the verdict of acquittal for the purpose of giving it its full effect”. 
       
      
    139 It should be noted that there is no section such as s 391 in the Criminal Procedure Act of this State. Nor is there any procedure followed in our courts, such as that section lays down, of the Crown indicating before the jury panel that it does not intend to lead evidence on a particular charge on the indictment. It can be seen that the purposes of the legislation was to accord the accused the full benefit of an acquittal before the trial took place and, therefore, the decision in Young is understandable having regard to the terms of the section. The decision in Young held that the principle that full effect must be given to an acquittal is not limited only to a trial at which evidence was in fact adduced but extended to the situation covered by s 391. 
     
      
    140 In my opinion the incontrovertibility that has been accorded a verdict of acquittal after trial by jury, or a determination of fact made after a hearing on the merits, or by the terms of a particular statutory provision should not be applied to a situation where the acquittal arose incidentally by the Crown accepting a plea of guilty to a lesser offence. I do not see that any of the policy considerations, even giving the double jeopardy principle its widest scope, require that a verdict of acquittal to murder, arising from the acceptance of a plea to manslaughter, be given the status of incontrovertibility so that it is immune from further consideration by a jury at other proceedings. The real verdict recorded by the Court was a conviction of manslaughter. That was the only finding that the Judge was required to make. If the verdict of acquittal of murder is recorded at all, it can only be in the recording of the acceptance of the plea of guilty to the manslaughter charge. 
     
      
    141 But more significantly there was no positive finding by a tribunal of fact, whether it be by judge or jury, that the accused was not guilty of the charge of murder. Nor was there any statutory provision to give it that effect. To the extent that the issue arising from the charge of murder was joined between the parties on the accused pleading not guilty on arraignment, the issue was concluded when the Crown accepted the plea of guilty in discharge of the indictment. On the authorities the acceptance of the plea resulted in a decision not to lead evidence on the murder charge so that an acquittal resulted. But that was an automatic result following upon the acceptance of the plea and there was no decision on the merits of the allegation of murder. There was no finding made by the Court other than that the accused was guilty of manslaughter. There was nothing that gave the verdict of acquittal the status of a verdict delivered after a trial by jury in accordance with the principle in Sambasivan. 
     
      
    142 It was in my view at most a technical acquittal that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit on the charge of murdering his brother. There can be no question that such a result should follow the acceptance by the Crown of the plea of guilty to manslaughter. But I do not understand why the acquittal of murder should be accorded more substance than that. I doubt that the accused, the Crown or the Judge understood that the accused had been acquitted of the charge of murder by the adoption of that procedure. In those circumstances I do not see why fairness to the accused or the preservation of the Court’s determination should require that the Crown now be precluded from prosecuting the accused with murdering his parents on the basis that the acquittal of murdering his brother prevents a jury from considering the circumstances in which that killing arose. The acceptance of the plea of guilty was on the basis that the Crown could not at that time negative that the accused acted in provocation. The acquittal means no more than that. In my opinion there would be no manifest inconsistency between a conviction of manslaughter of his brother and convictions of murder of his parents that would bring the courts into disrepute or undermine the principle of incontrovertibility of verdicts after trial. 
     
      
    143 The plea of guilty to manslaughter accepted that all the elements of murder had been made out. The accused, however, relied upon the reduction of murder to manslaughter by the operation of s 23 of the Crimes Act on the basis that the act causing death was committed under a loss of self-control induced by the conduct of his brother. The Crown accepted that it could not on the evidence then in its possession prove the absence of provocation beyond reasonable doubt. Yet as I have indicated above, there was no finding by the Court that the accused had acted under provocation or that his brother had killed his parents. What then was the effect of the acquittal of murder other than to ensure that the accused could not be prosecuted again for murdering his brother? What facts had the acquittal determined against the Crown? How would a jury give full effect to it on the trial of the murder of the parents if there is no clear understanding of what it meant factually? 
     
      
    144 If the accused’s submission be correct and the prosecution cannot proceed because to do so must inevitably challenge the acquittal, the accused could not be prosecuted even in the face of the most damning evidence of his guilt of murdering his parents that came to light since the sentencing proceedings for the manslaughter of his brother. And this only because at the time of taking the plea the Crown could not negative that the accused was acting under provocation. I do not believe that the principle of double jeopardy goes so far as to protect the accused from prosecution for the crime of murdering his parents simply because he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his brother and, as an incident of the acceptance of the plea, was acquitted of the murder of his brother. 
     
      
    145 In the passage quoted above from Carroll Gleeson CJ and Hayne J left open the limits of the principle of incontrovertibility. I would limit it, at least in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary, to a decision following a hearing on the merits by the tribunal of fact. That would include a case where there was a jury verdict for whatever reason, including where the Crown offered no evidence on, or there was no evidence of, a particular count in the indictment. This seems to me to be consistent with the authorities that have examined and applied the principle. 
     
      
    146 In Storey at 387 Gibbs J stated that, where evidence is admitted that may tend to show that an accused was guilty of an offence for which he had been acquitted, it would sometimes be necessary to give the jury a direction to accord the acquittal full weight. But his Honour seems to have left open the possibility that there would be occasions where no such direction was necessary. Calcedo was a case where no direction was required. So in my opinion would be the trial of the accused for the murder of his parents. I do not believe that the acquittal on the charge of murder should be accorded such significance in this particular prosecution. There were no facts determined by the acquittal that should legally disentitle the Crown from asking the jury to find that the accused murdered his parents. 
     
      
    147 In my opinion there is nothing in Carroll that suggests that the proposed prosecution is in breach of the formal aspects of double jeopardy that I am here considering: that is there is nothing that legally prevents the Crown from seeking to have the accused convicted of murdering his parents. It may be that the evidence led by the prosecution would give rise to an inference that the accused was wrongly convicted of manslaughter and should have been convicted of murder, but the further prosecution does not seek to negative, substitute, or relitigate that verdict: cf Carroll at [103]. I know of no decision that has held that a later prosecution cannot call into question, at least incidentally, a previous conviction. There are cases that have held in effect that a later prosecution might incidentally call into question an earlier acquittal provided it does not seek to controvert it: see R v Z [2000] 2 AC 483; R v Degnan [2001] 1 NZLR 280; Carroll at [50] and [94]; and R v VN [2006] VSCA 111. 
     
      
    148 The conviction of manslaughter proves that the accused unlawfully killed his brother. That is not an issue that is in dispute at the proposed trial. The proposed prosecution does not put that verdict in jeopardy in any sense. A verdict that the accused murdered his parents is not necessarily inconsistent with an allegation that he unlawfully killed his brother, even if the jury might think that the conviction should have been for murder rather than manslaughter. The Crown is not bound by its acceptance of the plea to manslaughter on the basis of provocation and there is no fact decided by the sentence imposed upon the accused by Abadee J. There is in my opinion no breach of the principle against double jeopardy by the further prosecution of the accused. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Oppression by multiple proceedings 
      
    149 A prosecution can be stayed as an abuse of process where it is oppressive or vexatious because it seeks to relitigate issues that have already been decided. In Walton v Gardner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393 it was stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""[P]roceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it is sought to litigate anew a case which had already been disposed of by earlier proceedings"". 
        
       
       
      The rationale for granting a stay of proceedings on the basis of multiple proceedings is not only the aspect of unfairness or vexation to the accused but also that the further proceedings will bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
       
      
    150 A determination whether to stay proceedings on this basis involves an exercise of balancing various factors including: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""the requirements of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of charges of serious offences and in the conviction of those guilty of crime, and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice”:  
        Walton v Gardner 
         at 396. 
        
       
      
    151 When considering whether to grant a stay by reason of oppression for whatever reason, it is not necessary for the court to be satisfied that the trial would necessarily be unfair but it is necessary for the court to be satisfied that the interests of justice demand that a party be refused the jurisdiction of the court that it has otherwise properly invoked: Williams v Spautz (1992) 174 CLR 509 at 519. 
     
      
    152 The power of a court to stay an indictment on the basis of oppression arising from the repeated prosecution of charges arising from the one incident is a reflection of the principle of double jeopardy. The circumstances where the court might exercise the power usually arise because there is none of the more formal remedies against double jeopardy, such as a plea of autrefois or a plea in bar, available. But unlike the situation where there is a likelihood of inconsistent verdicts arising or where there is a complaint that a verdict of acquittal will be undermined by the proposed prosecution, the concern is not so much with the possibility that the system of justice will be brought into disrepute by the outcome of the proceedings. Rather the concern is with the apparent abuse of power of the state, exercised through the prosecutor, against an individual. The tension is between the right of the prosecutor to bring multiple prosecutions in order to comprehend the total criminality arising from a particular event or transaction as against the vexation and harassment that arises from repeated prosecutions based upon the same conduct of the accused person. 
     
      
    153 There is little doubt that the accused had a reasonable expectation that the investigation and further prosecution arising from the incidents that occurred on 28 August 1993 were concluded by the acceptance of his plea of guilty to manslaughter. That expectation would have been confirmed by the result of the first coronial inquiry. Thereafter there were occasions when he was in danger of having that expectation frustrated by the findings of the second coronial inquiry or the proceedings commenced by his uncle. However, on each occasion the Director or the Attorney General indicated that a prosecution would not be commenced at that time. 
     
      
    154 True it is that the Director has not indicated that a prosecution would never be commenced, but it can be accepted that with the passage of time the accused would have become more confident that no further prosecution was going to occur and gone on with his life in the belief that this part of his past was for all practical purposes over. Of course it is easy to assume his guilt and picture the accused believing that he had escaped punishment for the murder of his parents. But this is where it is important to keep in mind that the court acts upon the presumption of innocence, however strong a prosecution case might appear against an accused person. 
     
      
    155 The simple fact that the Director decides to proceed with a prosecution even after he has made a determination at an earlier stage not to proceed does not itself give rise to an abuse of process notwithstanding that the expectations of the accused may have been frustrated by the later decision: R v Swingler (1995) 80 A Crim R 471. This is because the decision not to prosecute taken at any particular occasion does not promise or represent that there will be no prosecution in the future: Swingler at 479. The prosecution discretion cannot be fettered by a general rule that the Director cannot revisit an earlier decision and pursue a different course. The court will only intervene in the rare case where it can be shown that the further proceeding “would be unacceptably oppressive, or unfair to an accused or an affront to the public conscious to permit the prosecution to proceed”: R v Gagliardi and Fillipidis (1987) 45 SASR 418 at 433. 
     
      
    156 However, what is involved is again a balancing exercise considering various public interests not the least being the public interest in the prosecution of persons alleged to have committed serious criminal activity. It is trite to observe that the more serious the offence charged the more heavily will the oppression weigh upon the accused to be further prosecuted but, on the other hand, the more significant will be the public interest in the prosecution continuing. It must be obvious that there is a considerable public interest in the prosecution of an accused person for the murder of two persons, regardless of the relationship of the deceased persons to the accused. 
     
      
    157 It is not unreasonable to conclude that the Crown could have prosecuted the accused with all three killings in 1995 on the basis of the supposed similarities in the killings and what other evidence was available to indicate that the accused might have been responsible for all three. At least it could have asked the jury whether there was any reasonable possibility, given the three killings and that the accused admitted to one of them, that he was not responsible for all three. But this is to second-guess the Director. He was entitled to form the view that, even if the case was put on that basis, there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction of the accused for the murder of the parents. If that were the case, then it would arguably have been an abuse of process to put him on trial for the death of his parents. 
     
      
    158 It cannot be an abuse of process for the Director to dutifully exercise his functions according to his assessment of the evidence at particular points of time, but ultimately form a different view because he believes that further evidence now makes a prosecution appropriate. I am unable to conclude that it is unreasonable for the Director now to have made the decision to prosecute the accused as the evidence now stands. Although the accused relies upon decisions where a change of the prosecution’s intention has resulted in an abuse of process, those are decisions on their own facts. There is no sense in this case of the prosecution treating the courts “as if they were at its beck and call”; see R v Bloomfield [1997] 1 Cr App R 135. It is not a case of the prosecution abusing its power by making repeated attempts to convict the accused of a particular offence such as was the situation in Carroll. It seems to me to be rather a case of the prosecution determining to resist any attempt by any person to prosecute the accused for murdering his parents while the Director was of the view that there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction. 
     
      
    159 I am not persuaded that the further prosecution of the accused is detrimental to the public interest notwithstanding the delay and the fact that the accused’s reasonable expectations will be disappointed. It must be said that this is principally because of the seriousness of the allegations and the public interest in them being resolved by a jury in the exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court rather than in its jurisdiction being denied to the Crown. But I also take into account the lack of any suggestion of improper behaviour by the Director or investigating police. While minds might differ as to the quality of the fresh evidence, I am not prepared to hold that it was insufficient to justify the Director’s change of opinion as to the appropriateness of a prosecution of the accused. I am not persuaded to the necessary degree that the exceptional course of staying the proceedings is warranted. 
     
      
       
      Order: 
      
    160 The application for a stay of the indictment is refused.

     v 
      REGINA 
      
     PETER JAMES HENRY v REGINA 
      
     
     
      
      Facts 
       
       
      The two Appellants were convicted after separate trials in the District Court for offences arising from the importation into Australia of methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).  
       
       
      The Appellant Henry was charged and convicted of a single offence under s233B(1)(d) of the  
      Customs Act 
       1901 (Cth) and s11.5 of the  
      Criminal Code Act 
       1995 (Cth) for conspiring to import into Australia a commercial quantity of MDMA being, 31.95 kilograms, with a pure weight of 10.443 kilograms. He was tried with four other accused and each accused was arraigned on a separate indictment.  
       
       
      The Appellant Swansson was charged under s233B of the  
      Customs Act 
       1901 (Cth) and s11(1) of the  
      Criminal Code Act  
      1995 (Cth) for aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring the commission of the above offence. He was tried with two other accused and each of them was arraigned on a separate indictment. The Appellant Swansson was further arraigned under a second indictment for the State offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of MDMA. 
       
       
      The Appellants submit in a common ground of appeal that the trials and convictions of each of the accused, including each of the Appellants, were a nullity as the trials proceeded on more than one indictment.  
       
       
      The Crown accepts that the “one indictment, one jury” principle is longstanding. The Crown submits that it is merely a rule of practice, rather than a rule of law. It submits that no coherent justification for the rule appears in the authorities and, accordingly, it contends that the rule plays no relevant role in the modern criminal justice system. 
       
       
      Alternatively the Crown submits that contravention of the rule does not result in the proceedings being a nullity in the strict sense. It asserts that the Court can invoke the proviso and that, on the facts of the case, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. 
       
       
      The Appellant Swansson asks the Court to proceed to hear his other grounds of appeal. 
       
       
      Held 
       
       
      One indictment one jury 
       
       
      Per Spigelman CJ, McClellan CJ at CL, Sully J agreeing; and per Simpson and Howie JJ. 
       
       
      1 The proposition that there can be only one indictment in any one criminal proceeding is a long established rule of criminal procedure. This Court should apply the forceful, albeit obiter, reasoning of the High Court. [35], [83], [98], [151], [182].

      4 “Convicted on indictment” under s5(1) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912 is not confined to valid convictions on a valid indictment. [46], [68], [83]. It is open to this Court to apply the proviso in s6(1) of that Act, notwithstanding the characterisation of the proceedings as a “nullity”. [46], [50], [83].

       about the significance of the “one indictment, one jury” rule are of such force and clarity that the Court should hold that the defect is of a fundamental character and the proviso has no application. [52], [54], [83]. 
       
       
      Per Sully J  
       
       
      6 The proviso cannot authenticate the penal consequences of a trial process that has been a nullity for failure to observe a fundamental norm of a fair, lawful criminal trial upon indictment. [109].

     David Anthony SWANSSON  
     v 
      REGINA 
      
     PETER JAMES HENRY v REGINA 
      
      
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The two Appellants were convicted after trial in the District Court of offences arising from the importation into Australia of prohibited imports, being 31.95 kilograms of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) with a pure weight of 10.443 kilograms. 
     
      
    2 Ten persons were allegedly involved in the conspiracy to import the drug. Two trials were conducted, involving eight accused. One trial included the Appellant Henry and four other accused. The Appellant Swansson was tried separately, together with two other co-accused. 
     
      
    3 In both proceedings each of the accused, including each Appellant, was arraigned upon a separate indictment. 
     
      
    4 The Appellant Henry proceeds on a single ground of appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial and conviction of the appellant are nullities as the trial proceeded on more than one indictment.” 
        
       
      
    5 The Appellant Swansson propounds a number of grounds of appeal, and seeks leave to add a ground in effectively identical terms to that of the Appellant Henry. 
     
      
    6 In each case the ground is based on the fact that separate indictments were presented for each of the accused, including each Appellant, in the two trials.  
     
      
    7 The Appellant Henry was charged and convicted of a single offence under s233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and s11.5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), to the effect that he conspired with certain named persons to import a commercial quantity of MDMA into Australia. 
     
      
    8 The Court has before it the indictments presented against the co-accused in each of the trials. All of these indictments, other than in the case of the Appellant Swansson, are in the same form as the indictment in the case of the Appellant Henry. 
     
      
    9 The charge against the Appellant Swansson was different to the other charges in that it was based on s233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and s11.(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). He was alleged to have aided, abetted, counselled and procured the commission of an offence by certain named persons, who attempted to import a commercial quantity of MDMA into Australia. 
     
      
    10 There was a second indictment presented in the case of the Appellant Swansson. The Court was informed that this was an alternative charge. This indictment was for a State offence, namely that he knowingly took part in the supply of an amount of MDMA, being not less than the commercial quantity for that drug. 
     
      
    11 The proposition that there can be only one indictment in any one criminal proceeding is long established. It was recently accepted as correct in a five judge bench of this Court. (See R v Janceski (2005) 65 NSWLR 10; [2005] NSWCCA 281 at [86], [187] and [223].) The relevant authorities are longstanding, have never been questioned and have formed the basis of virtually invariable prosecutorial practice. (See Munday v Gill (1940) 44 CLR 38 esp at 54-57, 75-76, 86-88; R v Landy [1943] VLR 73 at 73-75; R v Tagaras (unreported, NSWCCA, 9 April 1974); R v Harris (No 2) [1990] VR 305; R v Howard (1992) 29 NSWLR 242 at 247-248.) The rule of criminal procedure was succinctly stated in Tagaras as: “one indictment, one jury”. 
     
      
    12 On this appeal the Crown seeks to characterise the rule as merely a rule of practice, rather than as a rule of law. It submits that no coherent justification for the rule appears in the authorities and, as the rule plays no relevant role in what was described as the “modern” criminal justice system, it ought to be jettisoned. Alternatively, it submits that contravention of the rule does not result in the proceedings being a nullity in a strict sense. It submits that the Court can invoke the proviso and, on the facts of this case, there was no miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    13 There are two kinds of situations in which the issue before the Court could arise. The first is where one person is tried on more than one indictment. The second is where multiple offenders are tried together on separate indictments. The present appeals involve both kinds of situations. 
     
      
       
      The Rule of Criminal Procedure 
       
      
    14 The common law rule of criminal procedure – “one indictment, one jury” – is accepted in texts and authorities of such long standing that there has been no systematic statement designed to explain its origins or to support its continued significance. A variety of reasons have been proffered from time to time and, as the Crown submitted, statutory provisions and changes in other aspects of criminal procedure indicate that such reasons no longer carry conviction. I do not find it necessary to canvas these reasons. 
     
      
    15 In its contemporary application, it is sufficient to refer to the clear statements of the existence of the rule in Crane v Director of Public Prosecutions [1921] 2 AC 299 where two offenders were tried together on separate indictments. 
     
      
    16 Lord Atkinson said at 321: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [I]t is, I have always understood, elementary in criminal law, that the issues raised by those two pleas cannot be tried together. … 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant … was never … properly arraigned on the indictment found against him. He never pleaded to that indictment, the jury who found him guilty were never sworn to try him separately, and had no jurisdiction to find against him the verdict they have found. The whole proceedings were, in my view, … a mis-trial and a nullity.” 
        
       
      
    17 Similarly Lord Sumner said at 331: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [T]here was a miscarriage of justice (for such it is to deprive an accused person of the protection given by essential steps in criminal procedure) …” 
        
       
      
    18 Crane was unanimously accepted as authoritative by the High Court in Munday v Gill, supra. 
     
      
    19 Gavin Duffy and Starke JJ said at 76: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [I]n a trial upon indictment the jury is, and can only be, impanelled and sworn to try the issues of the particular indictment – to find whether the accused be guilty or not guilty upon that indictment and no other. Therefore the simultaneous trial of several indictments is impossible, and the decision of the House of Lords that such a trial was a nullity and without jurisdiction inevitably follows.” 
        
       
      
    20 To the same effect are the observations of Dixon J who, after emphasising at 86-87 the solemn significance of trials on indictment, said at 87: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [T]here is no way allowed by law of putting in charge of one jury at one time two or more prisoners arraigned upon separate indictments. The jurors are specially chosen for the single purpose of trying one indictment or such of the prisoners arraigned on one indictment as they may have in charge. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Court of Criminal Appeal decided that it was not competent for a Court holding criminal inquests to depart from this method of trial and try by one jury simultaneously prisoners separately indicted.” 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour referred, in this context, to the judgment of the Privy Council in Abdul Rahman v The King-Emperor (1926) LR 54 Ind App where the following was said at 104: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [T]heir Lordships … wish it to be understood that no serious defect in the mode of conducting a criminal trial can be justified … by the consent of the advocate of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    22 I should also note the judgment of Isaacs CJ in Munday v Gill. His Honour dissented, but only in that, unlike the majority, he would apply the rule to the trial of summary offences. His Honour’s reasoning on the strength and significance of the departure from the “one indictment one jury” rule was equally as emphatic as the judgments of the majority. Isaacs CJ identified the relevant issue at 54 in terms of whether or not there had been a “breach of a fundamental principle of justice”. He also referred with approval to Lord Atkinson’s judgment in Crane. His Honour added at 55: 
     
      
       
        
        “[B]eing a ‘nullity’ as to legal efficacy when challenged, it is an inescapable corollary that it is impossible to hold the conviction can be supported by eliminating the vitiating circumstances and considering the case on the residue.” 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour concluded at 60: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a breach of a fundamental principle of justice occurs, and so gives rise to a want of jurisdiction to proceed further, there is, of course, an irregularity in one sense, but in the relevant sense it is more than an irregularity, it is a nullity, and must, if challenged, be set aside unless there is statutory provision to the contrary.” 
        
       
      
    24 With respect to the Appellants’ submission that this Court should follow the reasoning in Munday v Gill which was, relevantly, unanimous, Ms Abrahams QC, who appeared for the Crown, submitted that the references were not part of the ratio decidendi of the case and, accordingly, this Court is not technically bound to follow it. This submission is based on the proposition that the issue before the court in Munday v Gill was whether the rule applied to multiple informations in summary proceedings. The Court assumed, but did not technically decide, that the rule applied to a trial on indictment. 
     
      
    25 It is the case that there is no authority technically binding on this Court with respect to this rule. That is because the rule is of such long standing, and the practice has been invariably followed for so long, that the occasion to determine the matter authoritatively has simply not arisen in Australia. The Crown asks this Court to adopt the approach of Canadian Courts which have, in a line of authority to which I will refer below, determined that the rule will no longer be followed in that jurisdiction. 
     
      
    26 The rule is well established. The case put forward for abolishing it is simply that it is a technicality which has no contemporary significance. On the other hand there has been no suggestion that the rule causes any difficulty other than, perhaps, the inconvenience that may arise when, as appears to be the case here, the prosecution overlooks it. 
     
      
    27 Legislation has, over a long period of time, abolished many of the technicalities hitherto associated with indictments. In this State, such intervention was consolidated and reinforced by the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That Act clearly proceeds on the assumption that the rule exists as a rule of the common law of criminal procedure. 
     
      
    28 There is, for example, no provision in the Criminal Procedure Act for the joint trial of separate indictments. This was regarded as determinative by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria when upholding the rule in Landy supra at 74-75. This contrasts with the detailed, express provision in s21 for ordering separate trials on matters raised on the one indictment. 
     
      
    29 Similarly, s23 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which limits to three the number of counts that can be placed on the same indictment, would have no, or limited, work to do if separate indictments could be tried together. 
     
      
    30 Further, s129 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which requires an indictment to be presented within four weeks of committal, does not envisage multiple indictments presented at different times. 
     
      
    31 Finally, s164 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which expressly permits a joint trial for persons separately indicted for perjury or false swearing, would be entirely unnecessary. 
     
      
    32 The Crown relied on the Canadian Supreme Court decision in R v Clunas (1992) 70 CCC (3d) 115, which overruled longstanding Canadian authority based on Crane and which had been affirmed less than ten years before by that Court in R v Phillips (1983) 8 CCC (3d) 118 and R v Khan (1984) 12 CCC (3d) 193. 
     
      
    33 It is pertinent to note that, until Clunas, Canadian authority applied the rule to both trials on indictment and by information. That has not been the Australian rule since Munday v Gill and, in this respect, Australian and Canadian case law has long since diverged. 
     
      
    34 It appears from the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada (see especially Phillips at 125 and Clunas at 116-117) that Canadian jurisprudence permits that Court, as a final court of appeal, to jettison a long standing rule of the common law on the basis that the rule can be characterised as a “technicality” which can be said not to serve “a real purpose”. I do not accept that Australian jurisprudence has developed in the same way. 
     
      
    35 In any event, such change, if any, is not appropriate to be undertaken by an intermediate court of appeal. In view of the force of the observations in Munday v Gill, which I have set out above, even if obiter, this Court should apply the reasoning. It this position is to change, it should be left to the High Court to do it. 
     
      
       
      Applying the Proviso 
       
      
    36 In the alternative to the submission that the rule should be discarded, the Crown submitted that it is open to this Court to apply the proviso. The Crown did not seek to rely on r4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952. 
     
      
    37 The Crown relied on a range of factors which, it is submitted, characterise the present proceeding so that the application of the rule is a mere technicality and that, accordingly, there was no miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    38 The following matters, which were not contested by the Appellants in written submissions in reply, were relied upon by the Crown: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Each of the indictments was valid; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Each of the accused was arraigned on his respective indictment and the jury was empanelled to try each of the accused on that indictment; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) All parties (including the jury) were aware that there were separate indictments; 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The jury was informed at the outset that this was, in effect, five trials; 
        
       
       
        
        (5) No objection was taken to the course adopted; 
        
       
       
        
        (6) The accused could properly have been the subject of a joint indictment; 
        
       
       
        
        (7) In the circumstances of this case it was appropriate that there be a joint trial of the accused (or rather two joint trials); 
        
       
       
        
        (8) Proper directions were given to the jury as to the evidence admissible against each accused; 
        
       
       
        
        (9) The learned trial judge separately summed up the case to the jury for each accused; 
        
       
       
        
        (10) There is no suggestion that either Appellant was in any way prejudiced by the procedure adopted. 
        
       
      
    39 In the present proceedings, on the above analysis, there has been a breach of a common law rule of criminal procedure. This has occurred with respect to the exercise by the District Court of a statutory jurisdiction with respect to indictable offences. (See District Court Act 1973 s166 and Criminal Procedure Act 1986 s46(2) and s130.) Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act sets out detailed requirements for Indictable Procedure. As noted above, the Chapter appears to assume, without enacting, the common law rule of criminal procedure that has not been observed in the present case.  
     
      
    40 The relevant case law, notably Crane and Munday v Gill, describes this failure in terms of “nullity”. I will discuss this characterisation further below. For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that such characterisation does not determine whether the proviso can be applied. 
     
      
    41 Over recent years the High Court has emphasised in a number of judgments the central significance of directing attention to the specific words of the statute creating a right of appeal in a criminal case. (See e.g. Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250 esp at [7]-[12]; Dinsdale v The Queen (1999) 202 CLR 321 esp at [3]; Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300 esp at [9]-[10] and [31]-[33], noting particularly the references set out at fn 49.) 
     
      
    42 Section 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that “a person convicted on indictment” may appeal from a conviction on a question of law and may do so without leave. A ground of appeal which invokes a common law rule of criminal procedure is an appeal of this character. 
     
      
    43 Section 6(1) of the Act, which sets out the basis on which this Court can allow an appeal against conviction and which contains the proviso, applies “on any appeal under section 5(1)”. 
     
      
    44 The issue before the Court can be expressed in terms of whether the words “convicted on indictment” in s5(1) refer only to a valid conviction or a valid indictment. If they do, then this Court would not have jurisdiction to hear the matter and the Appellants would need to institute proceedings in the Supreme Court invoking its supervisory jurisdiction to quash the conviction. This case has not been argued in these terms. However, I am quite satisfied that this Court does have jurisdiction. 
     
      
    45 One purpose of the Criminal Appeal Act is to ensure that this Court will hear all appeals in which errors of laws are alleged to have occurred in the course of criminal proceedings. There is no reason to read the reference to a “person convicted on indictment” in a restrictive manner. 
     
      
    46 It is now well established that a statutory right of appeal will be interpreted to extend to decisions that can be described as “void” or as a “nullity”. The case usually referred to as the contemporary authority on this issue is Calvin v Carr [1980] AC 574. However, one of the cases applied in Calvin v Carr at 590-591 was the House of Lords judgment in Crane.  It is determinative for present purposes. 
     
      
    47 Lord Atkinson said in Crane supra at 323: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact that the trial of Crane 
          
        was rightly held to be a mis-trial and a nullity does not disentitle him, under s3 of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act,  
        1907, to appeal against it. He is still a person convicted on an indictment within the meaning of that section, since those words cannot mean validly convicted, otherwise the statute would be futile and unworkable. The provisions of s4 clearly show that convictions which the Court of Criminal Appeal decide to be bad may be and are properly brought before them by the person convicted. The very purpose for which the Court was created was to consider whether the convictions of persons who had, in fact, been convicted were valid or the contrary, and to deal with them accordingly.” 
        
       
      
    48 Similarly, Lord Sumner said at 331 that, even though there was “in truth no trial at all”, Crane was a person “convicted on an indictment”. 
     
      
    49 This aspect of the reasoning in Crane was applied by the High Court in Russell v Bates (1927) 40 CLR 209 at 213-214, albeit in the context of an appeal under the Justices Act 1902, but which is not relevantly distinguishable for purposes of application to the Criminal Appeal Act. (See also R v Parker [1977] VR 22 at 29-30, 43; R v Cockrell [2005] 2 Qd R 448 at [12]-[15], [27]-[32].) 
     
      
    50 On these authorities it is open to this Court to apply the proviso, notwithstanding the characterisation of the proceedings in Crane and Munday v Gill as a “nullity”. 
     
      
    51 The High Court has recently determined the contemporary approach to the application of the proviso. The recent authorities emphasise that an appellate court must make its own independent assessment and determine whether the accused was proved to be guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, the High Court continues to acknowledge that there are circumstances in which, even though an appellate court was so persuaded, it should still allow the appeal and order a new trial. (See e.g. Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [45]-[46]; Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614 at [6]-[7], [35]-[36]; Darkan v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 1250 at [94] and c/f [139]-[140].)  
     
      
    52 The reasoning in this recent line of cases does suggest that the range of fundamental defects, of a character that would prevent the application of the proviso even where the Court is satisfied to the requisite standard of the Appellant’s guilt, may be more restrictive than in the past. Nevertheless the Court has not overruled earlier authorities such as Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 373, where the joint majority judgment of Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The proviso has no application where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings. If that has occurred, then it can be said, without considering the effect of the irregularity upon the jury’s verdict, that the accused has not had a proper trial and that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. Errors of that kind may be so radical or fundamental that by their very nature they exclude the application of the proviso …”  
        
       
       
      (Note the observations of Hayne and Gummow JJ in  
      Nudd  
      supra at [36].) 
       
      
    53 Uninstructed by authority, I would have concluded that the error on which the present appeals are based could attract the proviso. The surrounding circumstances identified in the Crown submissions which I have set out above, suggest that there was no miscarriage of justice in the proceedings. 
     
      
    54 However, in the absence of relevant guidance from the High Court on what departures from rules of criminal procedure “go to the root of the proceedings”, to use the terminology from Wilde quoted above, an intermediate court of appeal should be guided by the reasoning in Munday v Gill which I have set out above. The observations in that case about the significance of the “one indictment, one jury” rule are of such force and clarity, that this Court should hold that the defect is of the requisite fundamental character. If that position is to change, and I see much force in the Crown’s contention, it must be left to the High Court to make the change. 
     
      
    55 I should, however, state that I have not undertaken the detailed review of the evidence which Weiss requires this Court to undertake, in order to determine whether this Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Appellants. My analysis of the issue of law does not require this task to be undertaken. 
     
      
    56 By reason of the conviction appeal in the case of Swansson the Court has before it the materials and submissions that would enable the Court to undertake the detailed review of the evidence as indicated in Weiss. In the case of Henry however, there is no such appeal and no such materials or relevant submissions are before the Court.  
     
      
    57 The relevant passage in Weiss at pars [41]-[47] is open to the interpretation that this Court must “[make] its own individual assessment of the evidence” [41] whenever the proviso is invoked. However, Weiss itself was concerned with a situation in which the relevant error “might have affected the jury’s” decision-making processes [36]. No such effect could be, or was, suggested with respect to the defect in the present case. 
     
      
    58 As presently advised, in my opinion, the Court is in a position to apply the proviso without the detailed investigation set out in the paragraphs of Weiss I have referred to, by reason of the fact that the relevant “miscarriage of justice” is not of a kind which could have impinged in any way on the jury’s deliberations. However, this matter was not the subject of submissions. 
     
      
       
      Other Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    59 As noted above, the Appellant Swansson relies on other grounds of appeal as well as the challenge to the multiplicity of indictments. An issue has arisen as to whether this Court can deal with these other grounds if it were to uphold the appeal on the basis considered above. 
     
      
    60 As noted above, the judgments in Crane and Munday v Gill, reflecting a number of authorities, assert that a criminal trial that has been conducted in contravention of the rule of criminal procedure here under consideration is a “nullity”. Notwithstanding the force of these remarks, in my opinion, this Court should not proceed on the basis that the cases are authority for the proposition that a trial conducted in breach of this rule is to be treated as if there had not been a trial at all. Rather, the position is that there has not been a trial in accordance with law.  
     
      
    61 The use of terminology such as “nullity” and, in the administrative law context, the cognate distinction between “void” and “voidable” decisions, where appearing in judgments, must be approached with some caution. (See generally F C Hutley “The Cult of Nullification in English Law” (1978) 52 ALJ 8.) 
     
      
    62 This was recognised as long ago as 1946 by Dixon J in Posner v Collector for Interstate Destitute Persons (Vic) (1947) 74 CLR 461, where his Honour said at 483: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [W]hen a party is entitled as of right upon a proper proceeding to have an order set aside or quashed, he may safety ignore it, at all events, for most purposes. It is, accordingly, natural to speak of it as a nullity whether it is void or voidable, and, indeed, it appears almost customary to do so. … 
        
       
       
        
        When there has been a failure of the due process of law at the making of an order, to describe it as void is not unnatural. But what has been said will show that, except where upon its face an order is bad or unlawful, it is only as a result of the construction placed upon a statute that the order can be considered so entirely and absolutely devoid of legal effect for every purpose as to be described accurately as a nullity.” 
        
       
      
    63 To similar effect are the observations, albeit in an administrative law context, of Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [46]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In our view, it is neither necessary nor helpful to describe erroneous administrative decisions as ‘void’, ‘voidable’, ‘invalid’, ‘vitiated’ or, even, as ‘nullities’. To categorise decisions in that way tends to ignore the fact that the real issue is whether the rights and liabilities of the individual to whom the decision relates are as specified in that decision.” 
        
       
       
      (See also at [144]-[145] per Hayne J.) 
       
      
    64 This passage was referred to with approval in the joint judgment of the Court in Berowra Holdings Pty Limited v Gordon (2006) 80 ALJR 1214; [2006] HCA 32, where the Court was concerned with the effect of a statutory precondition for the institution of proceedings in a court. In that context the joint judgment noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “[10] … It was said that such proceedings are ‘invalid’ or a ‘nullity’. In [ 
        Bhardwaj 
        ] 
        ,  
        three members of this court pointed out in the context of administrative decisions that such expressions are statements of conclusion which are not necessarily helpful in resolving the rights of parties. Dangers are equally present in the context of proceedings in, and acts and orders of, courts.” 
        
       
      
    65 As Professor Mark Aronson pointed out in his article “Nullity” (2004) 40 AIAL Forum 19 at 20: 
     
      
       
        
        “Nullity is both a remedy and a legal consequence, or more accurately if less precisely, a bundle of legal consequences.” 
        
       
      
    66 The consequences of a proceeding being characterised as a “nullity” varies from one context to another. For example, in the case of a court of statutory jurisdiction, such as the District Court, an order of the court may be accurately described as a “nullity”, in the strict sense, for purposes of determining whether or not proceedings for contempt can be based on such an order. (See Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) (1999) 198 CLR 435 esp at [27]-[28] and [55].) 
     
      
    67 The present context is concerned with determining whether this Court can exercise its statutory power to order a new trial or, more particularly, whether it can consider the other grounds of appeal with a view to deciding that it should not exercise the discretion to order a new trial.  
     
      
    68 The relevant power to order a new trial is s8(1) which, like s5(1) considered above, refers to “an appeal against a conviction on indictment”. For the reasons I have given above with respect to s5(1), the words “conviction on indictment”, do not refer to a valid conviction or a valid indictment. 
     
      
    69 Again, this very point was determined in Crane. Notwithstanding the express finding that the trial was a “nullity”, the House of Lords ordered a new trial. Indeed, it adopted a somewhat strained process of reasoning to reach this conclusion. 
     
      
    70 At the time Crane was decided, the English legislation provided only for a verdict of acquittal if an appeal were allowed (i.e. the equivalent of s6 of the NSW Act). There was no express power to order a new trial (i.e. no equivalent of s8 of the NSW Act). The House of Lords held that the court could continue to exercise the pre-existing jurisdiction of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved to order a new trial by issuing a writ of venire de novo. (See Cooke “Venire de Novo” (1955) 71 LQR 100; R v Rose [1982] AC 822 at 831-833.) 
     
      
    71 If anything, the position is even clearer where, as here, there is an express statutory power to be interpreted. In my opinion, even in the case of proceedings which have been authoritatively characterised as a “nullity”, s8 of the Criminal Appeal Act applies and empowers this Court to order a new trial. 
     
      
    72 The Crown submitted that if this Court concluded that the trial was a nullity then it could not proceed to deal with the appeal. It submitted that this was in accordance with what had occurred in earlier cases, citing R v Brown; R v Tran (2004) 148 A Crim R 268 and R v Halmi (2005) 62 NSWLR 263. It acknowledged that there were observations to the contrary in Janceski. Indeed, in that case the court formally ordered a new trial, which is clearly inconsistent with the Crown's submission. The relevant case law was not considered in those authorities. In my opinion, the reasoning in Crane and the decision of the High Court in Russell v Bates are determinative on this issue. 
     
      
    73 Whether or not the writ of venire de novo should issue was held to be discretionary, even where the proceedings were a nullity by reason of the existence of multiple indictments. (R v Olivo (1942) 28 Crim App Rep 173.) The position is the same under s8 of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    74 Notwithstanding the fact that the Appellant Swansson should be successful on his additional ground of appeal, this Court should consider his other grounds of appeal which could lead to a verdict of acquittal. 
     
      
    75 Since writing the above the Court of Appeal has delivered judgment in the case of Deveigne v Askar [2007] NSWCA 45. In that case McColl JA considers at some length the authorities concerning “nullity”. (See esp at [82]-[96] and [127]-[136]; see also Giles JA at [8]-[9].) 
     
      
    76 As her Honour states at [82] the description of a proceeding as a “nullity” states a conclusion. Similarly, as Giles JA points out at [8], such a characterisation is often “not particularly helpful”. 
     
      
    77 In the present case the issue that arises is the interpretation of provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act, to which the use of the terminology of “nullity” in the judgments in Munday v Gill was not directed.  
     
      
    78 In view of their express reliance on Crane, in my opinion, their Honours were not using the terminology of “nullity” in the sense that there has not been a trial at all but, as I have noted at [60] above, that there has not been a trial in accordance with law. 
     
      
    79 Nothing in the analysis of McColl JA on the question of nullity is such as to give rise to any doubt in my mind that this matter is determined by the reasoning of the High Court in Russell v Bates and of the English Court of Appeal in Olivo. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    80 The ground of appeal which seeks to agitate this matter was not contained in the original Notice of Appeal of Swansson. This Court has to grant leave to amend the Notice. At the commencement of the trial the Crown indicated that it would have no objection to the amendment. Nevertheless, the amendment was not formally made by the Court.  
     
      
    81 The Court indicated at the conclusion of argument on this ground of appeal that it did not regard itself as part heard on Appellant Swansson’s conviction appeal. To preserve that position, it is best for this Court to regard itself as having only considered the application for leave to amend by adding the additional ground in the appeal. However, the Court should not make any order consequential upon the additional ground of appeal at this stage. 
     
      
    82 Accordingly the orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      In the matter of Henry: 
       
        
         
        1 Appeal allowed. 
         
         
        2 Convictions and sentences quashed. 
        
       
       
      3 A new trial be held. 
       
        
       
      In the matter of Swansson: 
       
        
         
        1 Leave to add additional ground of appeal granted. 
        
       
      
    83 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree with the orders the Chief Justice proposes and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    84 I do not wish to add to the Chief Justice’s reasons with respect to the indictments or the application of the proviso. It may be that the High Court will in future emphasise that before the proviso will be excluded there must have been a “substantial miscarriage of justice” (Wilde at 373: see also Bounds v R (2006) 228 ALR 190; the Chief Justice has already noted the observations of Hayne and Gummow JJ in Nudd). Such an approach is not presently open to this Court. 
     
      
    85 However, I wish to add some further observations on the question of whether this Court may consider the “other grounds of appeal” relied on by Swansson. 
     
      
    86 In Crane v Director of Public Prosecutions (1921) 2 AC 299 the Court of Criminal Appeal had determined, in the words of the Earl of Reading CJ, that “there has been no trial.” The two prisoners could not have been given in charge of the jury on two separate indictments in the same way as if they had been jointly indicted. The proceedings were void ab initio and from the moment the prisoners were given in charge of the jury the trial was a nullity” (R v Crane (1920) 3 KB 236 at 237). The House of Lords, by majority, concluded that, although the trial was determined to be a nullity, Crane was nevertheless entitled to exercise his right of appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1907. The essential reasoning was expressed by Lord Atkinson: 
     
      
       
        
        “He is still a person convicted on an indictment within the meaning of that section, since those words cannot mean validly convicted, otherwise the statute would be futile and unworkable … The very purpose for which the Court was created was to consider whether the convictions of persons who had, in fact, been convicted were valid or the contrary, and to deal with them accordingly” p 323. 
        
       
      
    87 In Munday v Gill, as the Chief Justice has indicated, the High Court stated that the simultaneous trial of several indictments was not possible and, in the words of Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ, such a trial was “a nullity and without jurisdiction” (emphasis added) p 76. Although, as the Chief Justice has discussed, the concept of a “nullity” is sufficiently broad to allow the conclusion in Crane, the question for this Court is whether a different consequence flows from a determination that the trial was conducted “without jurisdiction.” 
     
      
    88 A superior court has authority conclusively to determine the existence of its own jurisdiction: Parisienne Basket Shoes Proprietary Limited & Ors v Whyte (1938) 59 CLR 369. Although not a superior court, but a court of record, the District Court has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction DPP (NSW) v PM (2006) 164 A Crim R 151, [2006] NSWCCA 297 [62]. 
     
      
    89 The District Court has been provided by statute with jurisdiction to try the offences with which the appellants were charged. The proper exercise of that jurisdiction required that there be only one indictment. The failure to proceed on a single indictment leads to the consequence that this Court exercising its appellate jurisdiction must quash the conviction. However, by so doing this Court is not exercising a prerogative power and is not intervening because the District Court did not have jurisdiction to try the relevant offences. This Court determines an appeal from a conviction in which the essential question is whether the appellants were tried according to law. 
     
      
    90 In Parisienne Basket Shoes the High Court held that, although an information had been laid out of time, the proceedings could be heard and disposed of in the Magistrate’s Court. The court rejected the submission that the Magistrate lacked jurisdiction. Dixon J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In courts possessing the power, by judicial writ, to restrain inferior tribunals from an excess of jurisdiction, there has ever been a tendency to draw within the scope of the remedy provided by the writ complaints that the inferior court has proceeded with some gross disregard of the forms of law or the principles of justice. But this tendency has been checked again and again, and the clear distinction must be maintained between want of jurisdiction and the manner of its exercise. Where there is a disregard of or failure to observe the conditions, whether procedural or otherwise, which attend the exercise of jurisdiction or govern the determination to be made, the judgment or order may be set aside and avoided by proceedings by way of error, certiorari, or appeal. But, if there be want of jurisdiction, then the matter is  
        coram non judice 
        . It is as if there were no judge and the proceedings are as nothing. They are void, not voidable (Cp  
        The Case of the Marshalsea  
        (1612) 10 Co Rep 68 b, at pp 76 a, 76 b; 77 ER 1027 at pp 1038-1041)” (at 389). 
        
       
      
    91 The jurisdiction in the District Court to try the appellants for the relevant offences could only be exercised according to law if a single indictment was presented. Although the identified error occurred, with the consequence that the proceedings must be determined to be a nullity, the matter was not coram non judice. 
     
      
    92 Because, in many circumstances, a decision made by a body which is “without jurisdiction” may be devoid of any legal consequence, I was initially unsure as to whether the present matters could be resolved in this manner. However, the reasoning of the majority in Crane was authoritatively adopted by the High Court in Russell v Bates (1927) 40 CLR 209 at 213, where in a joint judgment of Knox CJ, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy, Powers, Rich and Starke JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We do not think it necessary to decide whether the Magistrate had, or had no jurisdiction to hear these cases together, for we are unable to agree with the conclusion that if there was no jurisdiction there was no adjudication from which an appeal lay to the Court of Quarter Sessions (at 213).” 
        
       
      
    93 Adopting the approach in Crane at 323, the joint judgment continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Magistrate had jurisdiction over the charges laid against the respondents and, even if what took place was no trial at all or a mistrial, nevertheless, to adapt the words of Lord Sumner in  
        Crane 
        , the respondents were convicted and to all appearances convicted on the charges laid against them. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Those words, to use Lord Atkinson’s language in  
        Crane v Public Prosecutor  
        ‘cannot mean validly convicted, otherwise the statute would be futile and unworkable.’ ‘The very purpose’ for which the appeal is given is ‘to consider whether the convictions of persons who had, in fact, been convicted were valid or the contrary, and to deal with them accordingly’” (at 213-214). 
        
       
      
    94 It follows that the appellants in the present case have “in fact” been convicted and accordingly an appeal lies to this Court. That appeal cannot be confined to the ground which raises the problem of multiple indictments. 
     
      
    95 There is one further matter. In the resolution of the appeal of Swansson the Chief Justice proposes that a new trial be ordered. By so ordering this Court must be understood to be ordering a trial on an indictment presented according to law. 
     
      
    96 SULLY J: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice. I concur in the making of the orders proposed by his Honour. I apprehend, however, that my own reasoning does not correspond entirely with the reasoning of the Chief Justice; and so I make the observations that follow.  
     
      
    97 The submissions of the Crown seem to me to put in issue some matters of profound importance to the principled administration of criminal justice. It is convenient to crystallise in particular three such matters: 
     
      
       
      [1] Should the principle which is sometimes abbreviated into the form:  
      “one indictment, one jury” 
       continue to be a fundamental norm of a trial upon indictment, according to law, of a criminal charge? 
       
       
      [2] If so, should a failure in a particular trial upon indictment to observe that fundamental norm result in the particular trial’s being treated by the law as a nullity? 
       
       
      [3] If so, is there any room for the application of the proviso to section 6(1) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) 
      ? 
       
      
    98 As to Question 1, I can see no answer, as the law now stands, to the proposition that there currently exists, and has existed for a very long time, precisely the principle: “one indictment, one jury”. I can see, moreover, no answer, as the law now stands, to the further proposition that the principle thus recognised has always been regarded, not as a mere technicality, or as an optional procedural extra, but as a fundamental norm of a trial upon indictment, according to law, of a criminal charge. Ample support for both of the foregoing stated propositions is found, in my opinion, in the reasoning of the High Court of Australia in Munday v Gill (1940) 44 CLR 38; and in the inferences properly to be drawn from the scheme of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) respecting the form and contents of indictments. These sources and other relevant curial decisions are examined and explained by the Chief Justice; and I need add nothing of my own to those passages in his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    99 The submissions of the Crown deal with the particular fundamental norm in a way which is becoming, as it seems to me, disconcertingly familiar in the ongoing development of the Common Law, and not least in the ongoing development of the common law of crime. It is now commonplace for proponents of what they are pleased to call law reform to attack some entrenched common law principle upon the sole basis that, to borrow the Chief Justice’s paraphrase: “……. It is a technicality which has no contemporary significance”.  
     
      
    100 It seems to me that the experience of the recent past teaches that any use of that invocation of “contemporary significance” in the context of proposed fundamental changes to, especially, the law of crime should cause warning lights to flash in the mind of every common law Judge. The nature of the warning is captured cogently in two particular statements of principle. One is contained in a paper entitled “Concerning Judicial Method”, which was delivered at Yale University in 1955 by Sir Owen Dixon, then Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. The other is contained in a work, “Orthodoxy”, published in 1908 by G. K. Chesterton.  
     
      
    101 The passage in Dixon CJ’s paper is: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is one thing for a court to seek to extend the application of accepted principles to new cases or to reason from the more fundamental of settled legal principles to new conclusions or to decide that a category is not closed against unforeseen instances which in reason might be subsumed thereunder. It is an entirely different thing for a judge, who is discontented with a result held to flow from a long accepted legal principle, deliberately to abandon the principle in the name of justice or of social necessity or of social convenience. The former accords with the technique of the common law and amounts to no more than an enlightened application of modes of reasoning traditionally respected in the courts. It is a process by the repeated use of which the law is developed, is adapted to new conditions, and is improved in content. The latter means an abrupt and almost arbitrary change. The objection is not that it violates Aristotle’s precept ……………. ‘that the effort to be wiser than the laws is what is prohibited by the codes that are extolled’. The objection is that in truth the judge wrests the law to his authority. No doubt he supposes that it is to do a great right. And he may not acknowledge that for the purpose he must do more than a little wrong. Indeed there is a fundamental contradiction when such a course is taken. The purpose of the court which does it is to establish as law a better rule or doctrine. For this the court looks to the binding effect of its decisions as precedents. Treating itself as possessed of a paramount authority over the law in virtue of the doctrine of judicial precedent, it sets at nought every relevant judicial precedent of the past. It is for this reason that it has been said that the conscious judicial innovator is bound under the doctrine of precedents by no authority except the error he committed yesterday.” 
        
       
       
       [The above quotation is taken from pages 158 and 159 of the paper as reproduced in the volume:  
      “Jesting Pilate” 
      , a compilation of Dixon CJ’s extra-curial papers and writings.] 
       
      
    102 The relevant passage in the Chesterton work is: 
     
      
       
        
        “Tradition refuses to submit to the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely happen to be walking about. All democrats object to men being disqualified by the accident of birth; tradition objects to their being disqualified by the accident of death.” 
        
       
      
    103 The origins of the present appeal are, in my opinion, a paradigm example of the dangers against which, in their different particular ways, both Dixon CJ and Chesterton were warning. For if it be asked why the existing and well-entrenched norm of “one indictment, one jury” should now be swept away at, so to speak, a stroke of the curial pen, then the frank answer is that to sweep away the norm would rescue the amour propre of whoever it was who decided, for reasons which nobody was able to propound for this Court in any way whatsoever, to depart from the norm. I can envisage, for my own part, no more unconvincing, no more unjustifiable, a basis upon which to disturb a fundamental norm of a criminal trial in our system of criminal justice. 
     
      
    104 This Court should, in my opinion, reaffirm in the plainest terms that the “one indictment, one jury” principle is a fundamental norm in a criminal trial in New South Wales; and that if there is to be an abrogation of that fundamental norm, then that abrogation should be accomplished by informed, thoughtful and measured legislative amendment, and not by yet another curial moving of the relevant goal posts in response to an adventitious administrative decision. 
     
      
    105 It should be affirmed in addition, in my opinion, that the “one indictment, one jury” principle does in fact have a practical value. An insistence upon the observance of the principle will entail, in the nature of things, that the Crown or other prosecuting authority must think through carefully, and then express in a clear and convenient form precisely what charge(s) it is proposed to bring to trial in a particular hearing before a particular Judge and jury. If two or more accused are to be tried jointly, then a single indictment will make that fact completely clear to the jury. If it is proposed to lay before the jury some alternative(s), then a single indictment will make that fact completely clear to the jury. 
     
      
    106 It has been remarked elsewhere that an indictment is not merely a sheet of paper containing writing. Indeed it is not. It is the statement, the formal tender of which commences correctly a criminal trial of a citizen. Clarity and precision are the minimum requirements of any charge(s) thus preferred against a citizen. Compliance with the established norm will achieve them. That is a deeply-rooted principle grounded in centuries of experience. In my respectful view this Court should resolutely say so. 
     
      
    107 As to Question 2, I can see no answer to the proposition that, as the relevant law currently stands, the relevant departure from the relevant fundamental norm has resulted in a trial procedure, but in a trial procedure so flawed as to be a nullity. The relevant supporting authorities are examined by the Chief Justice and I have no need to add anything to that discussion by his Honour. 
     
      
    108 As to Question 3, I would answer that question, simply: no.  
     
      
    109 If, as I believe, the “one indictment, one jury” principle is a fundamental norm of a criminal trial; then the proviso cannot authenticate the penal consequences of a trial process that has been a nullity. The reasoning of Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 373, which reasoning is quoted in paragraph [52] of the reasons of the Chief Justice, seems to me to be conclusive of the point. 
     
      
    110 The reasoning of the Chief Justice draws attention to three recent decisions of the High Court of Australia. I, with respect, do not understand them, or any of them, to alter the law as stated in Wilde (supra). 
     
      
    111 In Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300, the High Court took as the relevant starting point this proposition: 
     
      
       
        
        “36. By hypothesis, when the proviso falls for consideration, the appellate court has decided that there was some irregularity at trial. If there was not, there is no occasion to consider the proviso.” 
        
       
      
    112 The High Court went on to explain that in a case in which the use of the proviso might hypothetically cure some irregularity at trial, - for example, an irregularity in the form of the erroneous admission at trial of prejudicial evidence, that being the actual irregularity with which Weiss was concerned, - then the Court which is asked to apply the proviso must make its own independent assessment, in the manner explained by the High Court, of the trial evidence. 
     
      
    113 In my opinion Weiss is of no practical assistance in the present case. This Court is dealing, in my perception of things, not with an irregularity in a trial in which the established norms going to the root of the concept of a fair, lawful trial have been observed. This Court is dealing, rather, with a purported trial that was in truth a nullity by reason of a failure to observe one of those established norms. 
     
      
    114 In Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614; [2006] HCA 9 two Justices, Gummow and Hayne JJ, say at paragraph [36], and speaking of the proposition which I have previously cited from Wilde: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not necessary to explore the boundaries of this proposition or to attempt to identify circumstances in which it could find application. To do so would require close attention to what is meant by ‘essential requirements of the law’ and ‘the root of the proceedings’. These notions may reflect what has been said by some members of the Court respecting aspects of ‘due process’ discerned from Ch III of the Constitution. However that may be, in the context of a criminal trial it may be open to doubt whether some requirements of the law are properly to be dismissed as inessential or whether some requirements are to be classified as radical and others not.” 
        
       
      
    115 It seems to me, with respect, that those observations are obiter dicta. That seems to me to follow from what is said by their Honours in paragraph [37]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the present case, the proposition that the incompetence of the appellant’s counsel went to the root of his representation is either self-evident or circular. If all that was meant was that counsel was incompetent, the addition of reference to the root of the appellant’s representation is superfluous. If it was intended to convey that the incompetence of representation at trial led to a miscarriage of justice, it is a proposition that does not add to the considerations examined earlier in these reasons.” 
        
       
      
    116 A speculation that Wilde, or aspects of it, might be reconsidered by the High Court on some future occasion does not entail, in my respectful opinion, that this Court either can or should disregard Wilde now. 
     
      
    117 In Darkan v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 1250, the Court was concerned with a trial in which there had been a serious error of law in the directions given to the jury. The aspect of the decision that has potential bearing upon the present appeal is best dealt with, in my opinion, by attending to what is actually said in paragraphs [94] and [107] of the joint majority judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Heydon and Crennan JJ: 
     
      
       
        
        “[94] In  
        Weiss v The Queen 
         this court put aside questions relating to two particular kinds of defect in a trial. One was whether the proviso could be applied when there had been ‘a significant denial of procedural fairness’. This does not arise, because the trial was procedurally fair. The other was whether the proviso could be applied where there had been a sufficiently ‘serious breach of the presuppositions of the trial’. This was a reference to a trial which had ‘so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all’ or ‘where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings’. Neither defect existed in relation to the trial so far as it concerned the first appellant.” 
        
       
       
        
        “[107] It is true that the error went to an element in the case advanced against the second appellant at trial (unlike the position with the first and third appellants, in respect of whom there were other paths to conviction unaffected by the error). However, the second appellant’s complaints about the summing-up had a double aspect. One was that no direction at all should have been given; the other was that the direction was wrong in its terms. It is relevant that counsel did not ask the trial judge not to give, or to withdraw, the direction. It is true that if a direction were to be given, justification could be found for the form of the words used by the trial judge in  
        R v Hind 
        . But that case did not mandate that any direction be given. It was open to counsel to request that the direction not be given, or that it be withdrawn. The proposition that no direction should have been given was rejected above, but the failure of counsel to request that it not be given or that it be withdrawn suggests that counsel did not perceive the direction as especially damaging to the second appellant’s interests. It is also relevant that the error affected only the degree of probability required. The trial judge repeatedly referred to the concept of probability; his error was to speak of a real or substantial possibility or chance, rather than a level of probability below the balance of probabilities. The fact is that whatever the meaning of ‘a probable consequence’, the circumstances engineered by the second appellant fell within the expression. The complaints of the second appellant in particular about the direction appear to have been formulated after the conviction for appellate purposes. Even though they go to an aspect of the crime’s charges in one of their elements, their nature is not such as to suggest that there was in truth no trial at all.” 
        
       
      
    118 I would say, yet again, that the present appeal is not dealing with an irregularity, even a serious one, at trial. It is dealing, in my view, with a failure to observe a fundamental norm or “presupposition” of a fair, lawful criminal trial upon indictment.  
     
      
    119 As previously indicated, I concur in the making of the orders proposed by the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    120 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice and also those of McClellan CJ at CL, Sully and Howie JJ. In my opinion, in each case, the appeal ought to be allowed, and the conviction set aside. What follows are my reasons for that view. I do not propose to restate the background. 
     
      
    121 Two classes of case arise: 
     
      
    · the first is where two or more individuals, charged on separate indictments, are prosecuted in a single hearing;· the second is where one individual is charged with multiple offences on two or more indictments all of which are prosecuted in a single hearing. 
     
      
    122 Both are here relevant. Henry was prosecuted, in one trial, with four others. A separate indictment was presented against each accused. In another trial, Swansson was arraigned on two separate indictments. 
     
      
    123 On appeal, Henry pleaded a single ground, challenging the validity of a trial so conducted. Swansson, having pleaded other grounds of appeal, sought to join that challenge. 
     
      
    124 The appellants relied upon a line of authority to which the Chief Justice has referred, and to which I will return. The effect of the line of authority is pithily encapsulated in R v Tagaras, unreported, NSWCCA, 9 April 1974 as “‘one indictment’ – ‘one jury’”. The line of authority is said (on behalf of the appellants) to establish, as an inflexible rule of law, that any criminal proceeding may proceed only on a single initiating process, and that any criminal proceeding which purports to proceed otherwise, involving more than one indictment (whether against a single accused, or against multiple accused), is necessarily invalid to the point of being a nullity. The Crown recognised the apparent weight of the authority that supports that proposition, and thus the inevitability of the outcome of this ground, unless it could persuade this Court of one or more of the following propositions: 
     
      
    · that the line of authority is of less weight than would at first appear, and is not binding upon this Court;· that this Court can and ought to decline to follow the line of authority;· that, even if there exists a rule (whether of law or of practice), that a trial may only proceed on one indictment, the consequence of any departure from the rule is not necessarily the nullification of the trial, but may be less dire.· that, if the rule exists, it is open to this Court, by the application of the proviso to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, nevertheless to dismiss the appeals. 
     
      
    125 It was because of the Crown’s intention to argue that this Court ought not to follow its own, and other, precedents, that a five judge bench was convened. 
     
      
    126 I propose to proceed to deal with the questions as I perceive them to arise. Although the cases recognise the distinction between multiple accused charged on separate indictments and an individual accused charged with separate offences on multiple indictments in a single proceeding, that distinguishing feature has not ever been seen to create a relevant difference. 
     
      
       
      (i) Is there a rule (and, if there is, is it a rule of law or practice), binding upon this Court, that a criminal trial may proceed on a single indictment only? 
       
       
      (ii) If there is such a “rule” is it open to this Court now to declare that it is not (or is no longer) binding upon this Court? 
       
      
    127 So far as has been ascertained for the purpose of these appeals, the “rule” has its genesis (at least in the context of reported decisions) in Crane v Director of Public Prosecutions [1920] 3 KB 236 (in the Court of Criminal Appeal); [1921] 2 AC 299 (in the House of Lords). In Crane, two accused, charged on separate indictments, were tried together. It was held that, because of that procedural irregularity, the trial of Crane was a nullity. 
     
      
    128 Although the statements in Crane are powerful and unequivocal, the judgments and speeches are notable for the absence of any examination of the origins of, or rationale for, the “rule”. In the Court of Criminal Appeal the Earl of Reading CJ, who delivered the judgment of the Court, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant was convicted of receiving certain skins well knowing them to have been stolen. He gave notice of appeal against the conviction to this Court, alleging as the grounds of his appeal misdirection and the mis-reception of evidence. It was then discovered that another man named Morton who had been separately indicted for stealing the skins had been tried with the appellant and had also been convicted. It was apparently assumed by the learned Recorder and also by counsel appearing for the prosecution and the prisoners that the appellant and Morton were jointly indicted, the two prisoners having been given in charge of the same jury as if they had been jointly indicted under one and the same indictment, whereas, as we now know, there was a separate indictment against each of them. … 
        
       
       
        
        The result in our opinion is that there has been no trial. The two prisoners could not be given in charge of the jury on two separate indictments in the same way as if they had been jointly indicted. The proceedings were void  
        ab initio 
        ; from the moment the prisoners were given in charge of the jury the trial was a nullity …” 
        
       
      
    129 This was the full extent of the decision so far as it held that a trial must be limited to the accusations contained in a single indictment. In the House of Lords Viscount Finlay accepted that the rule existed, and devoted his attention to the consequences of departure from what is required by the rule. 
     
      
    130 Lord Atkinson said: 
     
      
       
        
        “When an accused person has pleaded ‘Not guilty’ to the offences charged against him in an indictment, and another accused person has pleaded ‘Not guilty’ to the offence or offences charged against him in another separate and independent indictment it is, I have always understood, elementary in criminal law, that the issues raised by those two pleas cannot be tried together. It is obvious that many inconveniences would arise in practice if they were tried together; one amongst them would be this, that in a case where a felony was charged against each, the one might by his peremptory challenges put off from the jury the very men by whom the other desired to be tried, whereas had they been indicted jointly and did not join in their challenges they might have been, and probably would have been, tried in succession, and only those jurors which the person on trial objected to would have been peremptorily challenged. But that consideration is, in my view, quite beside the point. The appellant, William Cane, was never, as far as I can discover, properly arraigned on the indictment found against him. He never pleaded to that indictment, the jury who found him guilty were never sworn to try him separately, and had no jurisdiction to find against him the verdict they have found. The whole proceedings were, in my view, as against him, a mis-trial and a nullity.” 
        
       
       
      (The observations concerning jury challenges in the middle part of this extract are, so far as I can tell, the sole attempt at a rationale for the “rule”.) 
       
      
    131 Lord Sumner said: 
     
      
       
        
        “My Lords, the statement of counsel, who defended the appellant at the trial and appeared for him in the court below, shows that in the belief of all concerned the appellant was tried at Leicester on an indictment which charged him, jointly with David Morton, with the offence for which a conviction was recorded against him. In fact there was no such indictment. The judgment of the Lord Chief Justice shows that the same view of what had occurred in the Court of Criminal Appeal. So tried, Crane was invalidly tried, and the conviction was without authority. I see no ground for thinking that in reality there was a valid trial – namely, the trial of the appellant on the separate indictment, which had been framed against himself, while at the same time another person, Morton, also separately indicted, was being tried in reality separately though to all appearances with Crane, both simultaneously undergoing the same procedure before the same jury and sharing in the evidence, the speeches, and the summing up … It is clear that the appellant purported to have been tried and convicted on an indictment which did not exist. It was a mis-trial, and in truth no trial at all.” 
        
       
      
    132 Finally, Lord Parmoor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “My Lords, the appellant, Crane, was separately indicted for receiving stolen goods, and a man, named Morton, was separately indicted for stealing and receiving the same goods. Owing to some mistake, which was not discovered until the appeal was brought before the Court of Criminal Appeal, Crane and Morton were tried together, as though they had been jointly charged in one indictment. The result is that Crane was not tried on the indictment, on which he had been charged, and the trial is a nullity. I think it is impossible to hold, that it is within the competency of any criminal court to try a prisoner on an indictment, which, so far as he is concerned, is non-existent.” 
        
       
      
    133 In the Court of Criminal Appeal no reason was given why a joint hearing of two separate indictments constituted a nullity. In the House of Lords, the nearest to a reason being assigned lies in the speech of Lord Atkinson, extracted above, to do with the exercise by one accused of peremptory challenges, possibly to the detriment of the co-accused. This, as a rationale, as I see it, has no application to the present cases. It is entirely irrelevant to Swansson’s case. So far as Henry is concerned, it was accepted that he and his co-accused could all have been tried together on a joint indictment. Had that happened, each would have been entitled to peremptory challenges, even if that resulted in challenge to potential jurors whom another accused would prefer to have been selected. The “inconvenience” of conflicting attitudes to jury selection would therefore exist where two accused were tried jointly. 
     
      
    134 In R v Dennis; R v Parker [1924] 1 KB 867, the Court of Criminal Appeal said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No criminal Court has jurisdiction to try two separate indictments at one and the same time …” 
        
       
      
    135 Crane was cited as authority. The Court declined to accept an argument to the effect that the accused had consented to the procedure and that this distinguished that case from Crane. In rejecting that argument the Court characterised the issue as a jurisdictional one and not merely procedural. In Dennis, like Crane, two accused were charged on separate indictments, but tried together. 
     
      
    136 Albert Michael McDonnell (1928) 20 Cr App Rep 163 was a case in which two indictments presented against one accused were prosecuted jointly. Having recited the relevant facts, Hewart LCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was impossible to resist the conclusion that the whole trial was a mere nullity. The case was covered by  
        W Crane 
        …” 
        
       
      
    137 Crane, although in my opinion not binding on this Court, gave rise to a consistent line of Australian authority. It has been cited, applied and followed in Australian courts on a number of occasions. In 1943, in R v Landy [1943] VLR 73, in the context of a trial in which two indictments had been presented against one accused, Mann CJ, delivering judgment on behalf of the Court, distinguished Crane on that basis but cited McDonnell as authority for the proposition that the Crane principle applied in those circumstances also. 
     
      
    138 The Full Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Upon the whole, the position seems to be this, that both the  
        Indictment Act 1915 
         in England and the  
        Presentments Act 1916 
         in Victoria, while providing that different offences might be included in one presentment or in England in one indictment, and thereupon tried together subject to the discretion of the trial judge, make no provision for trying offences of the same kind together if included in separate indictments. It is difficult to support the objection on grounds of reason, but we have after careful consideration come to the conclusion that we should follow the position of the English Court and substantially on this simple ground, that whereas the Presentments Act (now the  
        Crimes Act 1928, 
         sec 397 and following) has altered the law by allowing more than one offence to be tried together, it has either deliberately or from oversight omitted to authorise their being tried together where the offences are set out in two separate presentments.” 
        
       
      
    139 In Tagaras, supra, (a NSW case) an accused was charged and indicted on three charges on one indictment, and on a fourth charge on a second indictment. The Court of Criminal Appeal (McClemens CJ at CL, Begg and Slattery JJ) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Notwithstanding the possible criticism which may be levelled at the decision in  
        McDonnell 
        ’s case it has been followed in England … and it was ultimately followed in the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in  
        R v Landy  
        … after pointing out that  
        Crane 
        ’s case was not really a precise authority governing the trial of one accused person on two separate indictments, that Court nonetheless felt it was desirable that the decision should be followed. We have considered a large number of authorities and reached the conclusion that we should follow the procedure which has been acted on for many years. We ought to make it clear that the practice should be that there can only be one indictment for any one trial. This is, in our view, consistent with what was said by Dixon, J, in  
        Munday v Gill & Ors 
        ., 44 CLR 38 at p 86 … 
        
       
       
        
        In our view the practice ought to be ‘one indictment’ – ‘one jury’.” 
        
       
      
    140 In R v Harris & Ors (No 2) [1990] VR 305, Ormiston J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is of course clear that the accused cannot be tried on two indictments or presentments at the same time.” 
        
       
       
      citing  
      Landy 
       as authority for that proposition. 
       
      
    141 The circumstances of Harris were far removed from the present. The issue there concerned a Crown application to present a new indictment, apparently replacing an indictment which had earlier been presented, pleading dates different from those which had previously been pleaded, and adding an additional count. (There does not appear to have been any statutory provision for amendment of an indictment.) 
     
      
    142 Ormiston J considered the application in the context of the fairness of the trial process, and referred to the power to stay any abuse of process (presumably, abuse of process which might result from the existence of dual indictments) and held that the Crown would be required to elect on which indictment to proceed. It was in that context that his Honour made the remark quoted above. The Court was there deciding no issue concerning the validity of a trial based on more than one indictment. The remark extracted was no more than a passing observation. 
     
      
    143 In this Court, in R v Howard; R v Mihilovic; R v Morgan; R v J (1992) 29 NSWLR 242, the Court was considering a series of appeals against convictions of murder. The proceedings were of some complexity, and also involved applications for leave to appeal against sentences, on the basis of asserted disparities between sentences imposed on a series of co-offenders, some of whom had proffered pleas of guilty to manslaughter, which had been accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictments. 
     
      
    144 Against that background, at p. 247, the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is to be noted that there can only be one indictment on any one trial: …” 
        
       
      
    145 Again, given the factual circumstances of the cases, and the issues that were before the Court, the remark cannot be taken as decisive in any relevant sense. It was, again, (as it purports to be) a passing observation. Munday v Gill (1930) 44 CLR 38 (to which I will return) and Tagaras were cited as authority for the proposition. A little later, the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “When, in January 1991, [four of the accused] were put upon their trial then, whatever they were charged with, a joint indictment naming the four of them was necessary: …” 
        
       
       
      Crane 
       was cited as authority for that proposition. 
       
      
    146 In R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; 64 NSWLR 10 Howie J, with whose reasons in this respect Wood CJ at CL, Hunt AJA and Johnson J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There cannot be a trial on two indictments at the one time ...” 
        
       
       
      His Honour cited no authority for the proposition, but it may be assumed that he had in mind the various authorities to which I have already made reference. 
       
      
    147 Notwithstanding the apparent weight of this authority, neither individually nor collectively do the statements persuade me that the “rule” for which the appellants contend is either as inflexible as these statements would suggest; nor is any of the statements binding upon this Court. Nowhere is the “rule” examined or explained. Nowhere is its origin identified. Nowhere is any rationale for the “rule” proposed. It is of some interest that the Court in Tagaras expressed some disquiet, possibly because of the inflexibility with which the rule is expressed, and the automatic and drastic consequences of its breach, but appears to have opted for maintaining precedent. 
     
      
    148 I accept, as the Chief Justice has hypothesised, that the absence of any examination of the rule or its origin may be because the rule is so well entrenched and of such long standing that it has not previously called for examination. That, in my opinion, is an explanation for the absence of any reasoned authoritative exposition of the “rule” as a rule; but it is an inadequate basis, in my opinion, to enable this Court to conclude that the rule is of such inflexibility as to admit of no examination. I would accept, on the basis of these authorities, that the “rule” is a rule of practice and that it has something, in practical terms, to recommend it as such: in this I do not disagree with the justification proposed by Howie J. What these authorities do not persuade me is that the rule is such as, if breached, of its own force to nullify an otherwise validly and properly conducted trial; and it is inadequate to persuade me that it would not now be open to this Court to undertake its own examination of the aetiology of the rule, and determine whether it ought continue to follow and apply it and, if it is to do so, in what way it is to be seen: as an inflexible rule of law with its own automatic consequences, or as a rule of practice, departure from which would constitute no more than an irregularity in the trial process, the consequences of which will depend upon the nature and, more importantly, the effect of the irregularity: see R v Lansdell, unreported, NSWCCA, 22 May 1995 at 4, 11; R v Marsland, unreported, NSWCCA, 17 July 1991; R v Rudkowski, unreported, NSWCCA 15 December 1992; R v Domican (No 3) (1990) 46 A Crim R 428. 
     
      
    149 That is not the case, however, in relation to the one remaining Australian authority which I have, to this point, left in abeyance, a case which cannot so readily be discarded. In Munday v Gill Isaacs CJ referred to  
     
      
       
        
        “… the fundamental doctrine of Crane’s case …”;  
        
       
       
      Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ said: 
       
       
        
        “And in a trial upon indictment the jury is, and can only be, empanelled and sworn to try the issues of the particular indictment – to find whether the accused be guilty or not guilty upon that indictment and no other. Therefore the simultaneous trial of several indictments is impossible, and the decision of the House of Lords [a reference to  
        Crane 
        ] that such a trial was a nullity and without jurisdiction inevitably follows.” 
        
       
       
      Dixon J (as he then was) said: 
       
       
        
        “But there is no way allowed by law of putting in charge of one jury at one time two or more prisoners arraigned upon separate indictments. Jurors are especially chosen for the single purpose of trying one indictment or such of the prisoners arraigned on one indictment as they may have in charge. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Court of Criminal Appeal decided that it was not competent for a court holding criminal inquests to depart from this method of trial and try by one jury simultaneously prisoners separately indicted. …” 
        
       
      
    150 The present issue was not directly before the High Court in Munday v Gill. The issue there was whether the rule, that was assumed to exist in respect of trials on indictment, also applied to summary proceedings prosecuted on information. In my opinion the Crown is correct in contending that even the powerful statements in Munday v Gill are not, strictly speaking, binding upon this Court in respect of the issue for present determination. The remarks are obiter. 
     
      
    151 However, the statements are of such power and force that, in my opinion, it is not now open to this Court to do other than accept that the law is as stated by their Honours. It is because of the statements in Munday v Gill, and only because of those statements, that I concur in the conclusion of the Chief Justice that it is not now appropriate for the Court to accede to the submissions of the Crown and embark upon a consideration of whether there exists such a rule, or whether it ought no longer be followed. This Court is obliged to accept that the rule is a rule of law, that it admits of no departure, and that any departure nullifies the trial. Each trial was, therefore, a nullity. The convictions cannot be allowed to stand. 
     
      
    152 I agree with the Chief Justice, contrary to the argument advanced on behalf of the Crown, that it is not open to this Court as an intermediate court of appeal, to follow the lead of the Canadian Supreme Court in R v Clunas (1992) 70 CCC (3d) 115, and abandon an established rule of law. That course was taken in Canada only by that country’s ultimate court of appeal. 
     
      
    153 Sully J and Howie J have proposed some benefits that flow from the existence of the rule: essentially, going to the orderly conduct of criminal trials, and certainty in what the Crown alleges and how it proposes to make its case. I agree that these considerations support maintaining the rule as a rule of practice. I do not agree that they are of such force as to warrant the characterisation of the rule as an inflexible rule of law. If they were the justification for the rule (and there is nothing in the authorities to suggest that they are the reason for its existence, as distinct from a convenient by-product of it) departure from the practice would require, not rectification of the process, but an examination of the consequences of the departure, and any ameliorative measures that have been taken to ensure that all parties (in which I include the jury) are aware of the nature of the case sought to be made by the Crown. 
     
      
       
      (iii) The proviso:  
      Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
      , s6 
       
      
    154 That a trial may not proceed on multiple indictments is not the only consistent theme to emerge from the UK and Australian authorities I have cited above. Equally consistent is the theme that the consequence of purporting so to proceed is to render the trial a “nullity”. For convenience, I will repeat the relevant passages: 
     
      
       
        
        “The result in our opinion is that there has been no trial … the proceedings were void ab initio; from the moment the prisoners were given in charge of the jury the trial was a nullity …” ( 
        Crane 
        , CCA) 
        
       
       
        
        “ … the jury … had no jurisdiction to find against him the verdict they have found. The whole proceedings were, … a mistrial and a nullity.” ( 
        Crane 
        , H.L., Lord Sumner) 
        
       
       
        
        “… It is clear that the appellant purported to have been tried and convicted on an indictment which did not exist. It was a mistrial, and in truth no trial at all.” ( 
        Crane 
        , H.L., Lord Atkinson) 
         
        
       
       
        
        “The result is that Crane was not tried on the indictment, on which he had been charged, and the trial is a nullity.” ( 
        Crane 
        , H.L., Lord Parmoor) 
        
       
       
        
        “It was impossible to resist the conclusion that the whole trial was a mere nullity.” ( 
        McDonnell 
        ) 
        
       
       
        
        “… the simultaneous trial of several indictments is impossible, and the decision of the House of Lords that such a trial was a nullity and without jurisdiction inevitably follows.” ( 
        Munday v Gill 
        ) 
        
       
      
    155 In any event, the pronouncements in Munday v Gill alone are sufficient to oblige this Court to proceed not only on the basis that the law precludes a trial being conducted on multiple indictments, but also on the basis that a trial so conducted is a nullity. That each trial now in question was a nullity is the starting point in the consideration of the applicability of the proviso. But what does that mean? 
     
      
    156 Implicit in the pronouncements is that there exists a distinction between a trial that is so fundamentally flawed as not to have been a trial at all – a procedure that is devoid of legal validity – and a trial that was merely procedurally flawed. Just what implications a finding that the trial was a nullity has is nowhere spelled out, and is difficult to determine. The implication is that the purported trial is to be treated as never having taken place: see, for example, Dixon J in Munday v Gill extracted below. Nowhere do the authorities clearly delineate, or even attempt to draw a dividing line, between a flawed trial that requires that the conviction that followed be set aside, and a trial that is so fundamentally flawed as to be a nullity. Nowhere do they identify the features of a purported trial that is a nullity, or the features of a trial that is merely procedurally or legally flawed. Indeed, in one of the passages extracted “mistrial” is used interchangeably with “nullity”, although the former is language that would ordinarily be applied to a procedurally flawed trial. 
     
      
    157 Because of the decisive manner in which the High Court, in Munday v Gill, pronounced trials commenced in the manner in which the trials the subject of the present appeals commenced as nullities this Court is spared the necessity of examining and deciding whether the undoubted error amounted to procedural irregularity or a flaw so fundamental as to render the trials not trials at all. That question is foreclosed by Munday v Gill. See, however, the discussion by McColl JA in Deveigne v Askar [2007] NSWCA 45. 
     
      
    158 But it remains necessary to consider the consequences of the declaration that a trial is a nullity. 
     
      
    159 As I have already observed, the authorities as to the meaning of the term “nullity” are very limited. However, there are indications that the term is synonymous with lack of jurisdiction. For example, in Crane Lord Atkinson held that the jury had no jurisdiction to return the verdict of guilty; and in Munday v Gill Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ adopted that approach, saying that the trial “was a nullity and without jurisdiction”. Dixon J then explained the consequence of proceeding without jurisdiction: his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… The clear distinction must be maintained between want of jurisdiction and the manner of its exercise. Where there is a disregard of or failure to observe the conditions, whether procedural or otherwise, which attend to the exercise of jurisdiction or govern the determination to be made, the judgment or order may be set aside and avoided by proceedings by way of error, certiorari, or appeal. But, if there be want of jurisdiction, then the matter is  
        coram non judice. 
         It is as if there were no judge and the proceedings are as nothing. They are void, not voidable…” 
        
       
      
    160 In a different context, the effect of a purported order that is made without jurisdiction and is, accordingly, a nullity, has been considered, at least twice, by the Court of Appeal. 
     
      
    161 In Attorney General for NSW v Mayas Pty Ltd (1988) 14 NSWLR 342, McHugh JA (as he then was), with whom Hope JA agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If an inferior tribunal exercising judicial power has no authority to make an order of the kind in question, the failure to obey it cannot be a contempt. Such an order is a nullity. Any person may disregard it. Different considerations arise, however, if the order is of a kind within the tribunal's power but which was improperly made. In that class of case, the order is good until it is set aside by a superior tribunal. While it exists it must be obeyed.” 
        
       
       
      Those observations were reiterated by Samuels AP in  
      United Telecasters Sydney Ltd v Hardy  
      (1991) 23 NSWLR 323 at 335, who held, similarly, that an order made by the District Court without jurisdiction was not binding on the party against whom it purported to be made and was “a complete nullity and bound no-one”. The passage was again quoted, with approval, and applied by Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ, in  
      Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) 
       [1999] HCA 19; 198 CLR 435 at 445. 
       
      
    162 In practical terms, of course, a person convicted (and imprisoned) as a consequence of a criminal proceeding that is a nullity is not able (even though entitled to do so) to disregard the order. But it might be useful to consider what would ensue if that person escaped from imprisonment. On the authority of Mayas and United Telecasters, he/she could not be convicted of escaping lawful custody. 
     
      
    163 The key to the distinction, it seems to me, is jurisdictional. In Crane, (Lord Atkinson) and Munday v Gill (Gavan, Duffy and Starke JJ) the concept of nullity was linked with an absence of jurisdiction. I have come to the view that a purported trial that is a nullity is one that the court in which the proceeding takes place is, for some reason, devoid of jurisdiction. This may be, for example (as has twice recently been demonstrated), that the indictment by which the proceedings are commenced is not signed by a duly authorised Crown Prosecutor in accordance with statutory requirements: R v Halmi [2005] NSWCCA 2; 62 NSWLR 268; R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; 64 NSWLR 10. 
     
      
    164 That is because, as was explicitly stated in Janceski, the indictment is the originating process that invests the court with jurisdiction. If the indictment is invalid, the court does not have jurisdiction to hear the charge or charges, and proceed to verdict; the proceedings on the invalid indictment are irregular, and cannot be regularised. They are a nullity. It is not to the point, with respect to McClellan CJ at CL, to observe that as the court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the subject matter of the proceedings (whether, as here, criminal charges, or civil proceedings); the court’s jurisdiction must also properly be invoked. Here, it was not properly invoked, with the results already stated. 
     
      
    165 The difficulty in the application of the proviso arises because of the characterisation of the trials as nullities. A finding that the trials were nullities is the inevitable consequence of applying Munday v Gill. It simply is not possible, having regard to the judgments in that case, to conclude that the trials were merely procedurally irregular. 
     
      
    166 S6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.” 
        
       
      
    167 Analysis of the section shows that it provides for an appeal against conviction to be allowed in three separate circumstances: 
     
      
       
      (i) where the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence; 
       
      (ii) where there has been a wrong decision of any question of law; 
       
      (iii) where on any other ground whatsoever there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
    168 By the proviso, even where a ground is otherwise made good, the court is empowered to dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. The proviso does not call for consideration unless one or more of those bases is established. (I interpolate that it is not every error of law that activates the second ground: that ground is founded upon there having been a decision on a question of law. Frequently enough errors of law infect trials even without a decision having been called for, or made. In these cases recourse will have to be made to the third ground.) 
     
      
    169 Here there is no question of unreasonable or unsupportable verdicts, or wrong decision of any question of law. The only possible basis, in the present cases, for the appeals to be allowed is the third – that there has been a miscarriage of justice. A finding that there has been a miscarriage of justice is, in turn, an inevitable consequence of the conclusion stated above, that each trial was a nullity. If the proviso were available to be applied in these circumstances, then the court would be required to draw a distinction between a miscarriage of justice and a substantial miscarriage of justice. The miscarriage of justice established in this case may, it is true, be characterised as a procedural one, but it is a procedural miscarriage of considerable moment – conviction following trials characterised by the High Court as “nullities”. I am unable to accept that a conviction following a trial which is so procedurally irregular as to be a nullity could nevertheless be preserved by the application of the proviso. 
     
      
    170 I do not, with respect, accept that the reasoning in Crane, extracted by the Chief Justice in paragraph [47], supports the availability of the proviso in the present case. As I read that passage, and the subsequent decision of the Privy Council in Calvin v Carr [1980] AC 574; [1979] 1 NSWLR 1, it is to the effect that, even where the ground of appeal, if successful, would lead to the conclusion that the trial is a “mistrial” or a “nullity”, nevertheless the purported conviction which follows is subject to appeal under the relevant criminal appeal legislation. If that were not so, then any convicted person seeking to challenge a conviction on a basis which would result in the trial being declared a nullity, or the conviction void, would be precluded from doing so under the appeal legislation, and be required, perhaps, to proceed by way of some form of prerogative relief. Crane and Calvin hold that the jurisdiction to allow an appeal against a conviction that results from a process that is a nullity derives from the same legislation that confers rights of appeal upon persons convicted in trials that are not so fundamentally flawed. That practical construction of the legislation ensures that convicted persons have a single avenue of challenge against conviction. It avoids the unpalatable alternative: a bifurcated route to challenge a conviction depending upon whether the ground is one that, if successful, would result in a declaration of nullity or one that, if successful, would establish one of the s6 grounds, notwithstanding that the trial itself was not so fundamentally flawed. 
     
      
    171 But I do not read the passage in Crane as leaving open the possibility that, where a successful ground of appeal results in the declaration of the trial as a nullity the conviction that flows therefrom may nevertheless be saved by the application of a legislative provision such as the proviso to s6. 
     
      
    172 Criminal appellate courts are familiar with the notion of determining or being asked to determine that a conviction resulting from a particular trial be set aside on any of the grounds provided for in s6. Ordinarily, a finding that there has been a wrong decision on a question of law, or a finding that there has been a miscarriage of justice on some other ground, does not raise any question of jurisdiction: it does not raise the spectre of nullity. 
     
      
    173 Where a court has jurisdiction to hear and determine a cause, it has jurisdiction to determine that cause correctly or incorrectly: Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte [1938] HCA 7; 59 CLR 369 at 377, 385, 389. The wrong decision of the cause does not make of the trial a nullity. 
     
      
    174 To hold that the proviso to s6 might apply in these circumstances is to hold that a conviction resulting from a trial which is a nullity (“which [was] as nothing”) because the court in which the conviction is entered lacked jurisdiction may nevertheless stand. In my opinion that cannot be the law. I cannot conceive that a conviction entered by a court that lacked jurisdiction to do so could nevertheless, by the application of the proviso, be allowed to stand. It would, of course, be otherwise if the proceedings were merely procedurally flawed or irregular. 
     
      
    175 In my opinion, in the light of the conclusion I have expressed above, that the trials were nullities, the proviso has no application. That conclusion comes about solely as a result of the characterisation of the trials as nullities. Each conviction must be set aside. 
     
      
       
      The remaining grounds of appeal 
       
      
    176 The final question concerns the grounds of appeal raised on behalf of Swansson other than that which concerns the indictments. In my opinion it is not open to this court to rule upon the remaining grounds of appeal. That is because there is nothing upon which to rule. Further, to embark upon such a course entails the possibility that the court would consider the grounds not made out – the consequence of which must be (apart from the finding on the indictment ground) confirmation of the convictions. For the reasons I have given in relation to the application of the proviso, I am of the view that this result is not available. 
     
      
    177 Even if the court were to uphold the grounds, or any of them, in the light of the finding that the trials were nullities, such a ruling would amount to an advisory opinion. I am conscious that in R v Brown, R v Tran [2004] NSWCCA 324; 148 A Crim R 268, Sperling J adopted that course. I am unable to agree that this is an appropriate course for this court to follow. The position is starkly illustrated by considering the consequence of determining a ground that a verdict was unreasonable: if the ground were rejected, the court would nevertheless allow the appeal on the indictment ground; but if the ground were upheld, the usual result would be entry, by this court, of a verdict of acquittal. But, in my opinion, this court could not order the entry of an acquittal following a trial that is a nullity. And, following Mayas and United Telecasters if the court were merely to express its view that the verdict was unreasonable, the Director of Public Prosecutions would be perfectly at liberty to disregard that expression of opinion and proceed to indict the appellant. 
     
      
    178 The approach I take may be seen to have some potentially disturbing implications. For example, the two trials in question produced some acquittals. On the strict approach I take, it would be open to the Director of Public Prosecutions to disregard (to use the word used by McHugh JA in Mayas) the acquittals, and present fresh indictments against any or all of those accused. Such an attempt would undoubtedly be met by an application for a stay of proceedings. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    179 By s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act, this court is required, where satisfied that any of the grounds has been made out, to “allow the appeal”. The inevitable consequence is the quashing of the conviction. By s8 the court is empowered, where satisfied that the miscarriage of justice found can more readily be remedied by an order for a new trial than any other order available to it, to make such an order. But how can this court, in the same breath, declare the trials to have been nullities – never to have taken place – and order that new trials be held? 
     
      
    180 In my opinion, the court should merely quash each conviction. It will be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine the future course of the allegations against the appellants. 
     
      
    181 HOWIE J: I have received the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of the other members of the Court. It is unnecessary that I set out the circumstances in which the grounds of appeal arise having regard to the nature of the ground that has been the subject of each of the judgments and that must result in the quashing of the convictions. I only wish to make a brief comment about what has been referred to as the “one indictment - one jury” rule. 
     
      
    182 I would have upheld the appeal by reason of the infringement of the rule even had it been open to this Court to have departed from what had been said by the High Court in Munday v Gill (1940) 44 CLR 38. To this extent I wish to join in the answers given by Sully J to questions 1 and 2 as posed in his Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
    183 It is not simply a common law jurist’s conservatism that would found my support for the preservation of the rule against multiple indictments, a rule that in my view is one of law rather than of practice. I agree, however, with Sully J that the Crown does not start from a favourable position in seeking this Court to overturn a rule, which has apparently operated with efficiency and fairness for as long as the memory of the common law has survived, simply because an officer of the Commonwealth was apparently ignorant of it. Yet, as the judgements of the Chief Justice and Simpson J disclose, the rule has been stated unambiguously in a number of decisions of this Court in recent times. 
     
      
    184 As Sully J points out there is a very real benefit to be gained from the rule: the single indictment presented to the trial court must identify precisely and without the need for any further particulars, given verbally or in writing, the manner in which the Crown is intending to proceed against an individual accused, where there is more than one charge, or against multiple accused, who are charged in the one indictment. In the proceedings before Wood DCJ none of the indictments in its terms told any of the accused, the trial judge, or the jury how the Crown was alleging that an accused was guilty of the offence charged in the indictment. 
     
      
    185 In the case of the two indictments presented against the appellant Swansson nothing indicated that the two charges, each specified in a separate indictment, were in the alternative or which was the primary charge. Nor in respect of each of the indictments charging an individual accused was it apparent that the Crown was alleging that each of them was jointly charged with the one offence, being a single conspiracy. On its face each indictment was alleging that the particular accused was separately charged with an offence of conspiracy, that is a different conspiracy for each of the accused. If these charges had been placed on a single indictment in the way they were framed, that would have been the assumption arising from the fact that they were each separately charged: see Mackey v The Queen (1977) 136 CLR 465. 
     
      
    186 During argument before this Court the Crown drew attention to the fact that it is the practice for a trial judge to direct the jury that that there are separate trials taking place in respect of multiple accused or multiple charges, a trial of each accused or of each charge. So, it was argued, the procedure adopted by the Crown before Judge Wood was consistent with this direction and, therefore, the direction would have been more readily understood by the jury than if there had been a single indictment. But I do not believe that a trial judge intends the jury to understand that there is literally more than one trial actually taking place. The direction is intended to make it clear that separate consideration must be given to each of the allegations in the indictment. In any event there seems to me to be a difference between separate trials taking place in the one proceeding and separate proceedings. Each indictment presented to the court commenced proceedings between the Crown and the accused: R v Hull (1989) 16 NSWLR 385. I do not understand that a jury empanelled to determine one proceeding could determine multiple proceedings: see Dixon J in Munday v Gill at 87. 
     
      
    187 I do not believe it is necessary to go in search of the rationale for the rule or to delve into history in an attempt to discover how it was derived. Nothing was placed before this Court by the Crown to suggest other than that the rule has always been a fundamental procedure attending a trial on indictment. That is how it has been considered by courts of the highest authority in this country and in England. I believe, for the reasons I have given, that the retention of the rule provides advantages to the efficient running of the present criminal justice system and, so far as I can see, the abandonment of the rule would have no practical benefit other than to possibly preserve the convictions of the applicants. 
     
      
    188 The question then arises as to what are the consequences of holding that the trial of the applicants was a nullity. I admit that I have not found this an easy matter to resolve but on an application of simple logic I cannot conclude other than that on this point Simpson J is correct. 
     
      
    189 I do not understand how this Court could apply the proviso to preserve a conviction of a jury after a trial that was in effect no trial at all. As the Chief Justice and Sully J have pointed out, on the authority of Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 it has been recognised that there can be “such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceeding” with the result that the proviso cannot be applied. Although the High Court has not recently considered the extent of that limitation on the operation of the proviso, I do not understand that there is any authoritative statement that Wilde is no longer good law, or at least so that this Court could disregard it. If it is acknowledged that there can be fundamental irregularities occurring in an otherwise valid trial that preclude the use of the proviso, I do not understand how it can be applied to a trial that is so fundamentally flawed that it is a nullity. 
     
      
    190 In R v Janceski (2005) 65 NSWLR 10 at [216] I expressed the view that the acquittal of the accused could not withstand a finding that the trial was a nullity but that the appellant was protected because it would be an abuse of process for the prosecution to attempt to proceed further on that charge. Hunt AJA and Johnson J agreed with my judgment. Although I favoured ordering a retrial limited to the charge upon which the applicant was convicted, that order was made to enforce the view that the Crown should not attempt to proceed on the charge on which the applicant was acquitted. There was no point raised by the parties in Janceski as to the effect of the Court’s determination that the proceedings were a nullity and no issue was raised as to the power that the Court had thereafter in respect of considering other grounds of appeal or making consequential orders. 
     
      
    191 I agree with Simpson J for the reasons given by her Honour that this Court should make no order other than to quash the convictions and should not proceed to consider the further ground of appeal raised by the applicant Swansson. As I have already indicated, in my opinion a verdict of acquittal cannot survive a finding that the trial was a nullity. In that case I see no purpose in this Court considering a ground of appeal that would result in a verdict of acquittal because the Court would be making an order that has no legal effect. I agree with Simpson J that this Court should not be expressing an opinion as to the merit of a prosecution without resolving a ground of appeal as this is not one of its statutory functions. 
     
      
    192 I agree with the orders proposed by Simpson J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with the reasons of Santow JA and his proposed orders, save as in respect of costs. I do not consider that this is a case where the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, should make a Bullock or Sanderson Order: Bullock v London General Omnibus Co [1907] 1 KB 264; Sanderson v Blyth Theatre Co [1903] 2 KB 533.  
     
      
    2 The authorities draw a distinction between those cases where a party sues more than one defendant to protect its own position, should liability not be established against one or other defendant, and where the conduct of a party creates an uncertainty as to who is the proper defendant. This sometimes occurs in cases where defendants are engaged in major construction work. Often, in that case, a plaintiff does not and could not reasonably know the contractual responsibilities as between proposed defendants. If the defendant found liable fails or refuses to advise the plaintiff of the correct position upon a request to do so, that may be conduct that is a cause of the plaintiff suing more than one party and which may thereby be a basis for making a Bullock or Sanderson Order. See generally Sved v Council of the Municipality of Woollahra (1998) NSW ConvR 55-842 at 56,605; Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales, Council of the Shire of Evans and Pioneer Road Services Pty Limited v Palmer (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 140; Wardle v Kick & Ors [2006] NSWSC 327; Almeida v Universal Dye Works Pty Ltd (No 2) [2001] NSWCA 156.  
     
      
    3 In my opinion, this case falls into the former category of case. The Nominal Defendant had a reasonable basis upon which to defend the proceedings. This Court has made a finding that the defence was not successful. That of itself does not amount to conduct which should result in a Bullock order against it. As no other conduct was relevant, I consider that the respondent should pay the costs of the Wollondilly Shire Council, both at first instance and on appeal. 
     
      
    4 SANTOW JA:  
     
      
      INTRODUCTION 
       
      Craig Allan Swift (“the respondent”) suffered injuries when his truck overturned. The trial judge, Phelan DCJ concluded in his favour that both the local council and an unknown driver, through their negligence, had contributed to the accident. Accordingly, Mr Swift successfully recovered damages from the Nominal Defendant and Wollondilly Shire Council (“the Council”), liability being apportioned two-thirds to the Nominal Defendant and one-third to the Council. Each now appeal against liability and damages. The damages awarded at trial are set out below, at [14], alongside the appellant’s contention as to what it contends should have been awarded. There is a cross-claim by the Nominal Defendant against the Council (Red, 6). On appeal, on liability, the Nominal Defendant supports the respondent against the Council, while the Council supports the respondent against the Nominal Defendant.  
       
      
    5 The accident occurred in the early hours of 17 May 1999 when the respondent was driving a prime-mover and trailer carrying coal on Wilton Road travelling towards Wilton. Mr Swift successfully alleged before the trial judge that he was required to take evasive action due to the presence of an unidentified vehicle travelling in the opposite direction. The latter was progressively moving across onto its incorrect side of the roadway so as to threaten a collision with Mr Swift’s truck. There was in fact no collision. According to Mr Swift, his evasive action led him to veer from the road across the 1 metre verge or shoulder so as then to travel along the kerb and gutter with the result that, on returning to the road, the vehicle turned over.  
     
      
    6 The Nominal Defendant challenges the findings that  
     
      
      (a) an unidentified second vehicle was involved, and  
      (b) due search and inquiry was made under s28(1) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988 (NSW).  
      
    7 The trial judge found that a material contributing factor to the rollover of the vehicle was the presence of a trench or gutter on the side of the roadway with a drop off of between 120 millimetres and 160 millimetres. According to the trial judge it was that “lip” which contributed to the truck rolling over as it emerged from the gutter onto the roadway, following its evasive manoeuvre.  
     
      
    8 The trial judge thus found, expressly or implicitly:  
     
      
      (a) a duty of care on the part of the Council owed to Mr Swift as a road user,  
      (b) breach by Council’s mode of re-sealing in creating a “lip” with a hazardous drop, and  
      (c) causation by reason of that lip and drop materially contributing to an increased risk of the truck overturning as it did, so  
      (d) giving rise to a one-third contribution to the accident on the part of the Council.  
      
    9 The Council challenges the finding that there was any duty of care on Council’s part so breached. The Council also challenges the trial judge’s conclusion as to causation in (c) above. The Council submits that if all other grounds fail, 10% is the correct order of magnitude of the Council’s contribution, not 33 1/3%.  
     
      
    10 In so doing, the Council relied upon its expert’s report from a Mr Johnston, in opposition to the expert’s reports from Mr Keramidas for the Nominal Defendant and Mr Wingrove for Mr Swift. Council also contended, correctly as was conceded, that the trial judge had failed to give any reasons for preferring the expert opinions of Messrs Keramidas and Wingrove over Mr Johnston and had failed to refer either adequately or at all to Mr Johnston’s expert evidence. Likewise he had failed to consider or take into account concessions made by Messrs Keramidas and Wingrove nor the evidence of Mr McTiernan, Council Manager of Traffic and Forward Planning.  
     
      
    11 The respondent conceded that he could not resist a new trial of his action against the Council. The Council made clear that, while it pressed primarily for a verdict in its favour based in the alternative on failure to show causation or breach of any duty of care, it sought a new trial if unsuccessful in its primary submission.  
     
      
    12 Both appellants challenge the trial judge’s finding that the respondent was not contributorily negligent. That challenge is based upon the speed he was travelling and upon his failure to wear a seatbelt.  
     
      
    13 Both appellants dispute the damages award. Damages are disputed as to non-economic loss which the trial judge determined as 35% of the worst case. Disputed also is the trial judge’s award for future economic loss, on the basis that Mr Swift’s residual capacity to work was assessed too low.  
     
      
    14 Damages were awarded as set out in the table below. The column headed “appellants’ contention” represents the matters contended for on appeal or their consequences. Future economic loss is challenged because Mr Swift’s residual earning capacity is said by the appellants to be higher than that estimated by the trial judge, who gave no sufficient reason for his calculation of it. The respondent, by reference to the submissions made at trial, seeks to explain what he says must have been the trial judge’s process of reasoning.

      SALIENT FACTS 
      
    15 At 5.15 am on 17 May 1999 the respondent (Mr Swift) was driving in a westerly direction along Wilton Rd within the Wollondilly Shire Council (“the WSC”) area towards Wilton. He was on a single lane portion of Wilton Road travelling west, with the eastern portion of Wilton Road being two lanes. The respondent was driving a tipper truck loaded with coal in an area where a number of other trucks were also transporting coal. The work practice between drivers was to stay in communication via radio in order to observe the noise restrictions associated with the residential area of Wilton and not to proceed in convoy.  
     
      
    16 The distance from the colliery along Douglas Park Road to the stop sign marking the entry point to Wilton Road was approximately 1.8 kilometres. At that point the driver would signal the driver at the colliery to follow so as to maintain an approximate three minute interval. There is then a further 2 kilometres to the accident scene just past Ashford Road near Wilton village. The ordinary travel time from colliery to the accident was under those conditions approximately three minutes though the possible time interval here is disputed.  
     
      
    17 Mr Thompson was the other truck driver proceeding west along Wilton Road in radio contact with the respondent. However, he was preceded by Mr O’Keefe who was also driving west and who arrived at the accident scene it appears about a minute before Mr Thompson. Mr O’Keefe arrived at the scene at about the same time as a third driver coming from the opposite direction. Mr Thompson and Mr O’Keefe both gave evidence that they saw no unidentified other driver or car.  
     
      
    18 There are several exit points from Wilton Road. These include Ashwood Road turning off Wilton Road, approximately 0.6 kilometres east of the accident site and approximately 1.4 kilometres west of the Douglas Park Road intersection (Blue, 19F,Wingrove report of 18 October 2002). The respondent contends that the likeliest explanation for Messrs Thompson and O’Keefe failing to sight any other east-bound vehicle was the latter’s “guilty flight” down a side-road such as Ashwood before the other two vehicles could be in a position to observe that vehicle.  
     
      
    19 The trial judge purported to draw on his local knowledge of the area. That gave rise to a further ground of appeal. The respondent seeks to meet this by reference to s144 of the Evidence Act. The latter permits “matters of common knowledge” to be determined by the judge, there being no application by either party for a view. However, the Nominal Defendant contends that the location of streets was not a matter of common knowledge. I would agree. But there was such evidence available independently of that, derived from the location of the relevant streets; Blue, 8-9.  
     
      
    20 There is a dispute as to Mr Swift’s speed from when he drove out of a right hand bend onto Wilton Road, onto a slight downhill slope but particularly just before the accident. The trial judge concluded that Mr Swift was a witness of truth. He accepted his evidence that his speed was within the speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour (Red, 55) and was between 60 to 70 kilometres per hour. He noted that Mr Swift had good reason for remaining within the limit because his employer (Heggies) regularly monitored truck noise at Wilton village, including such early times as when the accident occurred. He noted Mr Swift’s concern for maintaining his licence as the basis of his livelihood and also his desire to move from Heggies’ casual list of drivers where he was at the top of the list in order to attain permanency (Red, 33). The trial judge relied on these matters to conclude Mr Swift drove within the speed limit in the absence of any objective way of calculating his speed, such as an on-board computer.  
     
      
    21 The appellants challenge the finding that Mr Swift’s speed was within the speed limit just prior to the accident. They contend that there was an objective way of calculating his speed. They rely on Mr Keramidas' and Mr Johnston’s calculation of speed derived from the distance travelled by the truck to standstill after it rolled over, applying a coefficient of friction in accordance with the formula set out at Blue, 671 (Johnston report). That formula (v2 = u2 + 2as) is based on the physical principles embodied in Newton’s equation of motion.  
     
      
    22 Mr Swift maintained that the accident occurred after an unidentified vehicle travelling in the opposite direction swerved onto the incorrect side of the road, requiring him to take evasive action by moving to the left and into the gutter. He said that after flashing his lights to no avail, with the unidentified vehicle continuing to bear towards him he veered to the left, at the same time applying medium pressure braking. The trial judge found that this manoeuvre caused him to lose control so that the truck tipped over as it emerged from the gutter back on to the road.  
     
      
    23 The trial judge also found the Council to have been negligent and to have materially contributed to the accident, by the way in which Council had re-sealed the roadway adjoining the gutter so as to create a difference in the levels between the roadway and the gutter below. There was approximately one metre of roadway between the edge line of the western bound lane and the edge of the asphalt. Running adjacent to that shoulder was a channel or gutter 0.75 metres wide. This gutter with its lip was the result of successive asphalt re-sealing operations by the Council, whereby it raised the level of the road alongside the gutter. This maintenance had been undertaken without any modification of the adjacent guttering, so creating a trench with its lip measured by reference to the edge of the road surface of between 120 millimetres and 160 millimetres.  
     
      
    24 It is not disputed that Mr Swift lost control of the truck after he had entered and had proceeded some 80 metres in that gutter. There is however a dispute between the experts as to the precise mechanism and events leading to the truck tipping over as it re-entered the road. The Council, in this respect not challenging Mr Swift’s evidence, attributes the tipping wholly to Mr Swift’s evasive action to avoid the unidentified car; however it attributes a much higher speed than the 60 to 70 km/h (approximate) claimed by Mr Swift and accepted by the trial judge. The Council did not seek to characterise the evasive action as unreasonable in circumstances of split second emergency action. However, the Nominal Defendant, consistent with its denial of there being any unidentified car, attributes the accident rather to excessive speed on the part of Mr Swift in conjunction with the lip. The Nominal Defendant also relied on what it described as a “retardation” effect on the truck whilst in the gutter. This was denied by both Council and Mr Swift.  
     
      
    25 What is not disputed is that the truck overturned as it came out of the gutter and onto the road. For the purpose of calculating speed under the formula immediately prior to the accident, a calculation is required of the distance from rollover to stand-still or completion. According to Mr Keramidas the most likely distance from rollover to completion was 95 metres. This was based on coal spill on the road, marks on the left hand rock-face and the fact that it was impossible for rollover not to take place at the same time for both prime-mover and trailer, according to the expert evidence. Mr Wingrove calculated the distance as twenty metres shorter, namely around 75 metres. I shall return under “Disposition” to the outcome of their and Mr Johnston’s analysis of the probable speed.  
     
      
    26 It is against that broad factual background that I turn to the issues in dispute.  
     
      
       
      DISPOSITION  
      
    27 The appellants raise various grounds of appeal to challenge the trial judge’s approach to reconstructing the accident and analysing aspects of causation. I have broadly outlined the matters in dispute above.  
     
      
       
      Another vehicle 
      
    28 The trial judge’s finding as to the presence of an unidentified vehicle turned on the credibility he attributed to the respondent (Red, 56W-57B). The trial judge said (Red, 57-58),  
     
      
       
        
        “I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff was confronted by an unidentified vehicle which was negligently driven onto the wrong side of the road almost causing an impact with his vehicle. I am satisfied he acted reasonably in taking evasive action in first of all high beaming, braking within the caution of not jack knifing and going as far to the left as possible.”  
        
       
      
    29 Although the appellants pointed to the lack of tyre braking marks as countering the respondent’s account of a near collision and urgent evasive action, the trial judge did not accept that criticism. Rather, he was persuaded by the respondent’s evidence (Black, 82) that he took appropriate evasive action and applied moderate braking pressure to avoid jack-knifing the truck.  
     
      
    30 The respondent gave a consistent account of what occurred involving an unidentified vehicle in all his evidence, and was not shaken from this account in cross-examination. The respondent initially believed he had in fact collided with the other car (Black, 84-85). He maintained this belief until his admission to hospital, when visitors and others convinced him a collision had not actually occurred (Black, 284U; 451).  
     
      
    31 None of the expert witnesses, discussed below, could exclude the involvement of another vehicle, based on the known times and distances surrounding the crash and the existence of the Ashwood Road exit. These circumstances included the possibility that the required 3-minute interval between trucks could extend to 5 minutes on occasion. The trial judge noted as much at Black, 34-35. Further, none of the experts accepted the proposition that a collision with the other vehicle, in the circumstances described by the respondent, was inevitable.  
     
      
    32 It was possible that Mr O’Keefe and Mr Thomson, the other drivers on the road who did not encounter any other traffic, had missed the unidentified vehicle as it drove away from the accident scene (Blue, 459H-K, Blue, 418S). Although at times Mr Keramidas expressed doubts as to the likelihood of another vehicle being involved, he effectively withdrew those reservations in cross-examination (Black 692-694). Two scenarios could be sustained that explained why the other vehicle was not sighted by the witnesses – ‘guilty flight’ down Ashwood Road or simply that the vehicle passed the Douglas Park Road intersection prior to the other vehicles entering the intersection. The evidence from Constable Stevens, who attended the scene of the accident, did not assist one way or the other on the question of whether another vehicle was involved (Blue, 396, Black, 31).  
     
      
       
      Conclusion  
      
    33 The trial judge was entitled to draw the conclusions he did as to the presence and conduct of the unidentified vehicle.  
     
      
       
      Due search and inquiry 
      
    34 The trial judge’s finding in favour of the presence of an unidentified vehicle raised the question of due search and inquiry as required by s28(1) Motor Accidents Act 1988 (NSW) (the “MAA”), which relevantly provides,  
     
      
       
        
        “An action for the recovery of damages in respect of the death of or injury to a person caused by the fault or the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle on a public street in NSW may, if the identity of the vehicle cannot after due inquiry and search be established, be brought against the Nominal Defendant”. 
        
       
      
    35 The trial judge found that this obligation had been discharged in the circumstances by notifying the police as to the accident (Red, 38). In the context of the ‘guilty flight’ scenario, the trial judge considered it unlikely that any further police enquiry would have been productive (Red, 37).  
     
      
    36 In Harrison v The Nominal Defendant (1975) 7 ALR 680; (1975) 50 ALJR 330, the High Court considered the requirement of ‘due search and enquiry’ in s30(2), Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act 1942 (NSW), the predecessor to the MAA. Barwick CJ said (at 332),  
     
      
       
        
        “The stipulation that the identity of the vehicle is incapable of being established is made for the protection of the Nominal Defendant. It imposes no obligation, as such, upon the plaintiff though, the plaintiff to succeed must establish that the identity is incapable of being established as in the terms of the section. The word “after” in the sub-section does not, in my opinion, require that some inquiry and search must necessarily in fact always precede some other event or the drawing of a conclusion. If in the circumstances of the case, it is evident that the identity of the vehicle could not be established by due inquiry and search, the stipulation in my opinion, may be held to be established, although no inquiry and search should have been made.” 
        
       
      
    37 Barwick CJ also stated (at 332),  
     
      
       
        
        “Whether or not the tribunal of fact is satisfied that the identity of the vehicle cannot be established after such inquiry and search of which the circumstances admit will depend on all the circumstances of the case. An affirmative finding that the identity of the vehicle cannot be established in terms of the sub-section is, in my opinion, a finding which a court of appeal must rarely be able to set aside as erroneous.”  
        
       
      
    38 In the present case, I am not inclined to disturb the trial judge’s finding. The relevant authorities indicate not only that such a conclusion should rarely be displaced, but also that the statutory obligation must be considered in a realistic manner.  
     
      
    39 The due search and inquiry requirement was considered in Nominal Defendant v Smith (1998) 28 MVR 165. In that case the plaintiff was a pedestrian who was hit by a car. The plaintiff refused medical treatment from ambulance officers at the scene and left by taxi. He was not immediately aware he had been injured, but later needed significant hospital treatment for a leg injury. He contacted local police stations approximately six months after the accident. Although the police had attended the scene at the time, the officers had unusually failed to make or retain any note as to the identity of the car or driver. A number of other persons, such as local residents and the ambulance officers who had attended, were also at the scene. Sheppard AJA (with whom Priestly and Meagher JJA agreed) said (at 174),  
     
      
       
        
        “The question is whether, in all the circumstances, it was a case in which the respondent was required to do more. Harrison’s case and other later cases remind us that we must be realistic about the requirement… The judgment of Barwick CJ in  
        Harrison 
         cautions against an over zealous interference with the findings of trial judges on matters of this kind.”  
        
       
      
    40 Harrison is authority for the proposition that a plaintiff is not required to conduct a search that is obviously futile. This involved a departure from earlier authorities such as Blandford v Fox (1944) 45 SR (NSW) 241 that had adopted a more stringent approach. Prior to Harrison a dominant concern was the scope for abuse of the then novel idea of a statutory corporation created to meet liabilities arising from motor accidents where the defendant driver could not identified. As explained by Kirby P (with whom Clarke and Powell JJA agreed) in Oztan & Ors v NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation (1995) 23 MVR 259 (at 265),  
     
      
       
        
        “Ritual inquiries and charade procedures that may have been thought necessary in conformity with  
        Blandford v Fox 
         are no longer necessary if the tribunal of fact comes to the conclusion that “due” inquiry and search would have produced no real results to identify the motor vehicle.”  
        
       
      
    41 In Oztan the plaintiff’s car was stopped at traffic lights when it was struck from behind by another vehicle, which had in turn been struck from behind by a third vehicle. The third vehicle fled the scene. An eyewitness observed the third vehicle’s number-plate and told the information to the second driver, who in turn told the plaintiff. This number was given to the police and the police computer check revealed the third vehicle was a stolen car. The police inquiries failed to identify the vehicle, leading to the conclusion that the number was mistakenly recorded.  
     
      
    42 The witness had forgotten the number-plate by the time legal proceedings were in train approximately three months later, but stated that the car definitely had NSW registration plates. No inquiries were made outside NSW, no advertisements were placed in newspapers and local residents were not canvassed.  
     
      
    43 Kirby P found that the requirement of due search and enquiry had been satisfied but that it was “at the borderline” and “not…an entirely clear case” (at 265). He distinguished the scenario from a case where the very existence of the unidentified vehicle was in issue, commenting (at 265),  
     
      
       
        
        “The requirement of due inquiry and search is for the protection of the nominal defendant. But this is not a case (as many are) where there may be doubt that an incident occurred at all involving an unidentified vehicle. Here, there is no real room for dispute…[that the accident occurred as alleged]”  
        
       
       
      Conclusion  
      
    44 In the present case the respondent was only able to describe the car as a light coloured sedan and could offer no more helpful information such as a registration plate. The police were properly informed and there was in my judgment no realistic basis for requiring further efforts towards establishing the identity of the driver of the other vehicle. Accordingly I am satisfied that there is no sufficient basis for disturbing the trial judge’s conclusion that due search and enquiry was made under s28(1) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988.  
     
      
       
      Causation  
      
    45 The trial judge had the benefit of three expert reports dealing with the question of causation; Mr Wingrove was called by the respondent, Mr Keramidas was called by the nominal defendant and Mr Johnson was called by the Council.  
     
      
    46 The trial judge’s overall finding on causation was  
     
      
       
        
        “the forces engendered by longitudinal rotation, the motion of the vehicle, the slope, the depth of the gutter, the angle of the base of the gutter, the tyres, the problems occasioned on entry and finally departure all combined to cause the vehicle to tip over” (Red, 58 F-I).  
        
       
      
    47 Two aspects of this overall finding are the subjects of vigorous contest on appeal; first, the causal significance of the drop into and step out of the gutter and second, the speed of the vehicle.  
     
      
       
      Significance of the step  
      
    48 The liability of the Council is premised on the significance of the drop between the road surface and the gutter. The negligence that is asserted relates to the presence of this step or channel beside the road, created as a result of the resurfacing methods adopted by the Council. Each expert identified a number of dynamic forces that accounted for the rollover, of which the step was only one. Mr Keramidas, quoted by the trial judge in his judgment at Red, 53, spoke for example of the successive dynamic effects of the drop into the channel, the angle of the channel area (i.e. the slope of the surface of the gutter), contact between the kerbing and tyres, the steering movement to return to the roadway, the reaction of the truck’s suspension to these events and the potential for load shift within the vehicle (see Black, 546). Mr Johnston in addition emphasised the close proximity of the sandstone embankment to the gutter. Mr Keramidas also devoted some attention to the possibility that the hydraulics may have opened during the time when the truck was travelling along the channel, and that this was a possible destabilising event leading to the eventual rollover of the vehicle (Black, 602, 604-605).  
     
      
    49 It was incumbent on the trial judge to identify with some precision his findings as to causative contribution of the step relative to these other factors. The height differential between the gutter and roadway was potentially of significance as the cause of instability upon entering the gutter and/or as a cause of the rollover that followed the respondent steering the truck back onto the road surface. We know that the vehicle travelled some 80m from the tyre tracking in the gutter.  
     
      
    50 Speed was a relevant variable in respect to each of the constituent elements of the crash (the step, kerb, steering etc). In particular, there was evidence from Mr Keramidas that the dynamic impact of the step down into the channel and the step up when re-entering the roadway would be less significant at lower speeds (Black, 533). Mr Keramidas conceded that at 60-70km/h the significance of the step down would be significantly, if not entirely, diminished (Black, 768). The trial judge’s finding as to speed (that the speed was 60 to 70 km/h and thus well within the 80 km/h speed limit) was based essentially on matters of credit going to the truthfulness of the respondent and inference based on broad generalities. It needs to be tested against the objective evidence; see later.  
     
      
       
      Entering the channel 
      
    51 Regarding the entry into the channel, Mr Wingrove and Mr Johnston both stated that this was not a critical factor in rollover. There were suggestions from both Mr Wingrove (Black, 385-386) and Mr Johnston that the channel may in fact have been a stabilising influence as the vehicle tracked along the gutter (an effect Mr Johnston described as tram-tracking, Black, 756). Mr Wingrove stated that any instability caused by the drop would not be significant (Black, 434).  
     
      
    52 Mr Keramidas initially attributed more relevance to the entry as impacting on rollover. But he conceded in cross-examination that the slope created by the height difference created a lean that was within normal limits. Given the vehicle’s shallow entry angle, he said the lean created by the depth of the channel relative to the roadway was no more than would be tolerated in normal road construction (Black, 645-636).  
     
      
    53 The trial judge did not discuss at all the evidence from Mr Johnston or weigh it up in his conclusions. In dealing with the cause of the rollover, Mr Johnston considered that the step into the gutter did not cause the tyres to hit the vertical edge of the kerb. Rather, the slope of the gutter and the width of the tyres meant that was unavoidable (Black, 743). Hitting the kerb was in turn a source of instability contributing to rollover. However in Mr Johnston’s assessment the step down accounted for only 50% of rollover threshold and diminished as the truck travelled along the channel (Black, 769). The lean (which Mr Keramidas had described as within the range found in normal road construction) according to Mr Johnston was around 20-25% of rollover threshold (Black, 769). The trial judge failed to deal with this evidence, which suggested that the step down into the channel was not of itself a cause of the rollover that later occurred.  
     
      
       
      Exiting the channel 
      
    54 The Council challenges the trial judge’s finding that exiting the channel was a cause of the rollover. It disputes that any negligence could be attributed to the Council or such as could have had any causal effect in the rollover. Alternatively, the Council contends that even accepting that negligence by the Council as regards the different levels caused the problems occasioned by the channel, the apportionment of 30% liability in favour of the Council was excessive, given the other causative factors and should be around 10%.  
     
      
    55 In particular the Council points to the concessions made by Mr Wingrove and Mr Keramidas in cross-examination, and the neglect of Mr Johnston’s evidence.  
     
      
    56 Mr Wingrove stated in paragraph 15 of his written report that the channel made it extremely difficult for Mr Swift to steer back onto the roadway. This was said to be because the truck tyres, being super single size, fitted into the channel. The trial judge appeared to rely on this contention, being impressed by Mr Wingrove’s practical experience (Red, 34-35). Mr Wingrove had however also linked this channelling effect (the tyres being stuck in the channel) to  
     
      
      (a) retardation of the vehicle and,  
      (b) stable tracking along the stepped edge, in the same manner as had been postulated by Mr Johnston in regard to the stable tracking along the kerb edge (Black, 433).  
      
    57 However, he described the retardation as being “overcome” prior to rollover. Mr Wingrove declined to quantify the retardation effect (Black, 421), considering that such a calculation would be speculative. He also could not point to any physical indication in the form of tyre marks that demonstrated difficulty exiting the channel (Black, 404-405). Mr Johnston confirmed this opinion as to a lack of physical evidence on the point (Black, 765-766).  
     
      
    58 Mr Johnston’s evidence on the issue was that the step between the pavement surface and the floor of the gutter did not cause the truck to hit the vertical rise of the kerb. In cross-examination Mr Johnson said, given the slope of the bottom of the gutter and the width of the tyres (350mm) relative to the width of the gutter (700mm), it was inevitable that the wheels of the vehicle would hit the vertical edge of the gutter (Black, 743N).  
     
      
    59 Mr Johnston’s evidence during cross-examination was that although the step was an undesirable feature of the road (Black, 747X), it was not the critical problem. Rather, the key problem was the close proximity of the embankment to the kerb and guttering. Mr Johnston’s evidence was that the exit angle created by the steering manoeuvre required to direct the truck out of the gutter meant the vehicle would have hit the embankment in any case. On this basis Mr Johnston maintained that rollover was effectively inevitable and not caused by the step out of the gutter (Black, 756).  
     
      
    60 I consider that the upshot of this evidence from each of the experts and taking into account concessions in cross-examination should have been to direct attention to the circumstances for steering back onto the roadway, rather than simply the step itself. Critically, Mr Johnston’s evidence was that rollover was inevitable due to the lean, close proximity of the embankment and the steering manoeuvre to exit called for from the respondent. The trial judge did not engage with this aspect of evidence and did not provide reasons for ignoring Mr Johnston’s analysis.  
     
      
       
      Significance of speed and the trial judge’s finding based on credit  
      
    61 The trial judge accepted the respondent’s assertion that he was travelling within the 80km/h speed limit (Red, 58J), the respondent’s estimate being a speed of 60-70km/h. The trial judge expressly grounded this finding on his view of the credibility of the respondent, stating at Red, 55 L,  
     
      
       
        
        “…in relation to the question of speed I think it really gets back to my assessment of the plaintiff as a witness who has impressed me by his truthfulness…” 
        
       
      
    62 This followed the trial judge’s finding as to the presence of an unidentified vehicle, which he also described as a finding turning on questions of credibility, in the absence of other witnesses.  
     
      
    63 In making this finding as to speed the trial judge referred to his earlier comments on the good reasons the respondent had for observing the speed limit (Red, 32 to 33). These were that the respondent’s employer monitored truck speeds and noise through Wilton village and supervising staff, pulled up drivers who transgressed the rules. The respondent, who was a casual employee, was keen to secure a permanent position and was close to achieving this promotion. He thus had an additional incentive to observe these limits. The respondent also maintained that he was careful to drive lawfully to avoid risking his licence, which was the basis of his livelihood.  
     
      
    64 The appellants challenge the trial judge’s finding as to speed on this basis in circumstances where there was expert evidence from both Mr Keramides and Mr Johnson contradicting the respondent’s assertion that he was travelling within the 80km/h speed limit. The finding here was based not just on an impression of truthfulness (in that sense credit) but also on matters of contestable inference. The trial judge’s calling in aid that the respondent was a good worker and member of the community (Red, 55) afford no sufficient ground for drawing an inference as to his speed at the time of the accident nor do they add much weight to an inference in his favour, as against a calculation on the more objective basis below. The appellants submit that the trial judge’s conclusion was in error, particularly given that there was no evidence the respondent had been looking at his speedometer at the relevant time.  
     
      
    65 Each of the experts noted that the question of the respondent’s pre-accident speed was a difficult one, beset by uncertainties in the inputs relevant to the calculation. Mr Keramidas’ estimate was a range of 85 – 105 km/h (Black, 705). Mr Johnston agreed, believing it was at least 90km/h (Black, 740). Mr Wingrove criticised Mr Keramidas’ calculations but was later satisfied following some revisions and recalculations (Black 333-336). Based on a rollover point 75m from the point of rest (an estimate that favours a lower speed calculation), a pre-accident speed of not less than 82km/h was calculated (just over the speed limit) and was agreed between the three expert witnesses. The calculations of speed were made by Mr Johnston and Mr Keramides, and derived from the distance travelled to standstill after rollover, applying a coefficient of friction in accordance with the formulae v2 = u2 + 2as (Blue, 671, Johnston report). These calculations favoured the respondent as no braking was assumed (Black, 359). This was despite the respondent’s own evidence that he had braked upon seeing the unidentified car approaching. Both Mr Johnston and Mr Keramidas thought the friction coefficient used was also conservative, given the likely obtrusions from the truck and coarse asphalt surface (Black, 360). Mr Keramidas was also of the view that rollover was more likely to have been 95m from the point of rest, which would again increase the ultimate estimated speed.  
     
      
    66 The trial judge was persuaded by the presence of ‘unknowables’ and therefore leaned towards Mr Wingrove’s initial assessment, which was the most tentative expert view (Red 57). This approach did not engage with the variables identified by the experts, nor did it recognise that despite this uncertainty, and despite adopting conservative parameters, each expert concluded that the respondent had been travelling in excess of 80km/h. The trial judge did not take account of the concessions made by Mr Wingrove in cross-examination (Black, 353-354, 357) and the manner in which those concessions brought his view closer to the opinions expressed by Mr Keramidas. Critically Mr Wingrove agrees with Mr Keramidas’ calculations (Black, 357), although he later reaffirmed his initial view in re-examination (Black, 436). The trial judge was in my respectful opinion, in error by failing to engage sufficiently with this evidence.  
     
      
    67 The trial judge did examine the evidence from Mr Keramidas and Mr Wingrove on the cause of the accident and in particular the sequence of events and the different causal significance of each event. Mr Keramidas’ evidence, which the trial judge quoted from extensively, included the view that the respondent’s pre-accident speed was an overarching uncertainty that would impact upon any assessment of the events as they occurred (Black, 546). A finding on speed bore centrally on the explanation pressed by the Nominal Defendant for the accident, namely excessive speed, not wearing a seat belt and there being no other vehicle requiring evasive action on the part of Mr Swift.  
     
      
       
      Summing Up  
      
    68 I conclude that:  
     
      
      (a) the trial judge was in error in assuming a speed less than 82 km/h, namely 60-70 km/h. The speed limit being 80 km/h means that a slight excess over it still accommodates that degree of prudent responsibility attributed to Mr Swift in his favour by the trial judge. It certainly does not justify any finding of contributory negligence on the part of Mr Swift based on excessive speed;  
      (b) Nor do I consider that the cause of the accident could be attributed at all to the supposed negligence of the Council in allowing the road to be constructed with a difference in level between road and gutter. I consider that the evidence and expert analysis of Mr Johnston was correct and the conclusions which followed from it. He concluded that the step into the gutter did not cause the tyres to hit the vertical edge of the gutter. Rather, the slope of the gutter and the width of the tyres meant hitting the vertical edge of the gutter was inevitable on exiting. It was the exit angle created by the steering manoeuvre required to direct the truck out of the gutter which meant the vehicle would have hit the embankment in any case so that rollover was effectively inevitable.  
      (c) I see no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s conclusion that there was an unidentified vehicle which initiated the manoeuvre that ultimately led to the accident and resultant injuries. It is credibility based and does not depend on the less reliable impression by the driver of his speed. One either sees an on-coming car or one does not. Unlike the question of speed, there is no objective evidence which warrants a different conclusion to the effect that Mr Swift was lying when he attributed his evasive action to the on-coming vehicle. That the unidentified driver was not seen by the other two vehicles (Mr Thomson and Mr O’Keefe) can, I am satisfied, be adequately explained by that driver taking a “guilty flight” down a side street such as Ashwood Street.  
      (d) I do not accept that the step of interviewing individuals who might have seen the unidentified driver, such as the households alongside the various exit points, was required to conform to s28(1) MAA in relation to the Nominal Defendant. DAMAGES  
      
    69 The trial judge’s findings on damages are challenged on five grounds,  
     
      
      (a) the failure to reduce the award for contributory negligence by reason of the respondent driving at excessive speed; 
      (b) the finding that the respondent’s failure to wear a seat belt was not contributory negligence and thus did not justify a reduction in the damages awarded; 
      (c) the finding that the respondent’s injuries amounted to 35% of a most extreme case was excessive; 
      (d) the trial judge’s findings with respect to the respondent’s reduced earning capacity, past economic loss and past wage loss were in error; and 
      (e) the award of $500 per week for future economic loss was excessive and no reasons were provided for this award. 
      
    70 The ground alleging contributory negligence by reason of excessive speed is answered by my earlier findings as to causation. I would not on the evidence conclude that Mr Swift’s speed was excessive.  
     
      
    71 The second allegation of contributory negligence relates to the respondent’s failure to wear a seat belt. The trial judge was persuaded that the discomfort the respondent described (by reason of his height, the location of the belt and his long work hours of 12 hour shifts) was a reasonable basis for not wearing the belt at the time of the accident (Red, 58-9). It was not compulsory at the time to wear a seat-belt and while there were courses encouraging its wearing, it was still up to the individual driver. It was not suggested that Mr Swift was out of step with the practice of other drivers at the time. The trial judge said (Red, 59),  
     
      
       
        
        “To have to wear a seatbelt of an uncomfortable type, as described by him, to my mind seems quite unreasonable particularly in circumstances where the legislation at that time recognised that truck drivers of more than one tonne did not have to wear seatbelts. In those circumstances I am not persuaded that contributory negligence has been established.”  
        
       
      
    72 The submissions from the Council (which were adopted also by the Nominal Defendant) emphasised that the respondent was aware that seat belts were designed to minimise injury in the event of an accident, and pointed to the respondent’s evidence to this effect (Black, 187-189).  
     
      
    73 Finally it was asserted, based on Dr Henderson’s expert evidence, that his injuries would not have been suffered at all had he been wearing a seat belt, a matter going both to damages and causation.  
     
      
    74 I do not however accept these submissions. As to whether the injuries would have happened at all, had he been wearing his seat-belt, while there was no express challenge to Dr Henderson’s report, I am not persuaded that the trial judge was in error in concluding that it was unreasonable to have required Mr Swift to wear a seat-belt in those circumstances. I am likewise not persuaded that the evidence reliably establishes that the injury would not have occurred had he worn a seat-belt, including that Mr Swift had no knowledge as to whether his shoulder struck the cabin door; Black, 188.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion  
      
    75 I conclude that the trial judge was entitled to deal with the matter as he chose to and validly proceeded by reference to the authority of Nicholson v Nicholson (1994) 35 NSWLR 308.  
     
      
       
      Challenges to the damages findings – non-economic loss assessed at 35% of a most extreme case  
      
    76 The trial judge assessed the respondent’s condition as representing 35% of a most extreme case (Red, 76), as was required by s79, MAA. The Council’s submissions on this issue turned on the asserted presence of pre-existing conditions, in particular the respondent’s use of anti-inflammatory medication prior to the accident (Black, 137-138) to treat ongoing inflammation in his right knee. The Council also pointed to some instances of back pain in 1991, 1993 and 1997.  
     
      
    77 Other than recounting the respondent’s evidence before the trial judge as to the respondent’s medical treatment, recovery and gradual return to work, these submissions allege certain critical omissions from the trial judge’s reasoning. There is a suggestion that the respondent’s assessment of his pre-accident health as “normal” and “perfectly healthy” was inaccurate, yet there is evidence only of minor ailments and no particular conditions are identified that relate to the respondent’s ongoing post-accident complaints.  
     
      
    78 The Nominal Defendant complains that no specific regard was had to the respondent’s ability to lift his daughter (submission para 120), and points to other physical capacities for example in relation to family shopping. There is a further complaint about the trial judge’s treatment of the respondent’s post-injury capacity for work (submission para 128), including evidence as to the domestic tasks undertaken by the respondent and activities associated with his boat, which he purchased in 2003.  
     
      
    79 The Nominal Defendant submitted that the respondent’s capacity to earn should have been based on full time security work, which the respondent had conceded he could perform under cross-examination (Black, 185).  
     
      
    80 The theme of these submissions is that the trial judge failed to give due attention to the respondent’s capacities in his personal and work life, and failed to closely assess the argument that while receiving workers compensation payments at the full rate, the respondent was disinclined to maximise his earnings through work (para 135).  
     
      
    81 As to non-economic loss insofar as based on 35% of a most extreme case (s79 of MAA) the respondent submitted that 35% was well within a reasonable range, invoking as a discretionary assessment the constraints applicable to appellate intervention. In the respondent’s written submissions, the respondent puts the following matters. These I consider justify the conclusion that the trial judge’s discretionary determination of non-economic loss based on 35% of a most extreme case should not be disturbed.  
     
      
       
        
        “48. In his submissions Counsel for the Nominal Defendant conceded that the Respondent would overcome the "" 
        significant impairment 
        "" threshold [Black 831V] and that the percentage "" 
        was more closer to 30 in the early 30s 
        "" but that ultimately it was a matter for His Honour as to where it falls [Black 831 W]. 
         
         
        49. In her submissions Counsel for the Council, submitted that: "" 
        30 percent is more like the mark when one takes into account a most extreme case  
        "" [Black 833 K- L].  
         
         
        50. His Honour was entitled to take into account that:  
         
         
         i. as at the date of accident the Respondent health was very good, he had no physical problems and no emotional problems, [Black 71, R-U] was "" 
         like any other normal person, you know, no dramas really 
         "" (Mr Thompson) [Black 33X], was perfectly healthy [Black 450 E], loved life, had a good time and was never cranky at all (Respondent's wife) [Black 450 N], and was a work-a-holic (Respondent's wife) [Black 450 P], working six days a week on a twelve hour shift and Sundays washing trucks [Black 66, X].  
          
          
         ii. In answer to the Council's submission at paragraph 103, the Respondent conceded that he was taking Voltaren medication prior to the accident but said that was for fluid in the knee, following a knee infection years before the accident and that it "" 
         was not a constant thing 
         "", but it was periodic depending on what he did and that it did not stop him doing anything at all. [Black 138-1411;  
          
          
           
           Following the accident the Respondent was taken to Wollongong Hospital where an x-ray of the left shoulder revealed a chip fracture of the inferior part of the distal end of the clavicle with some displacement of the fragments [Blue 91 H] and a superior vertebral and a plate fracture at T8 which was subsequently confirmed by MRI Scan taken on 21 May 1999 [Blue 96 0].  
           
          
          
         iii. The Respondent received various modalities of treatment including, rest, medications, course of physiotherapy [Black 92F], courses of hydrotherapy [Black 92M] and nerve blocks which gave him temporary relief of about 3 to 4 hours [Black 113 W]. He was due to have further permanent Blocks but there is a funding problem so he hasn't had that treatment yet [Black 114 R]. He said he got a de-pain device called Pain Eze Plus machine in April 2003 which gave him some relief [Black 115 K].  
          
          
         iv. So far as prognosis is concerned Dr Schwarzer, who was a treating physician expressed opinion that the Respondent will: "" 
         suffer from some degree of pain long term and this will impact on his ability to enjoy life and to work as a truck driver 
         "" [Blue 242 X to 243 E];  
          
          
         v. Following the accident the Respondent suffered Nightmares and Sleep impairment. He had dreams of hitting a car, killing people, killing someone in a car and his sleep was impaired [Black 127 M-N]. He became anxious getting into a car [Black 104 S];  
          
          
         vi. Mrs Swift described the Respondent's mood since the accident as moody, quite bad temper to the extent that she became scared of him at times, very depressed, suicidal. As a consequence of this they separated about twelve months after the accident. [Black 452-453],  
          
          
         vii. In evidence the Respondent said he was pretty badly depressed and "" 
         I just gave up. Gave up fighting 
         . "" [Black 104 V] He was angry, would snap very easy, and that he wasn't himself. He found his relationship with his wife difficult. He became very depressed, separated from his wife;  
          
          
         viii. The Respondent said his mood deteriorated. He attempted suicide in October 2001 when he took a drug overdose. The background in the Wollongong Hospital clinical notes was given as depression / chronic pain after truck roll over accident 1998 [Blue 120 J];  
          
          
         ix. He was diagnosed by Dr Jones to be suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a direct result of the traffic accident on 17 May 1999 [Blue 225 H] and who expressed opinion that the Respondent "" 
         also suffers from depression as a result of the ongoing frustration. Helplessness is experienced at the hands of insurers and employers and the ongoing grief at not being able to return to truck driving which gave him immense satisfaction 
         "" [Blue 225 K] and that the Respondent "" 
         will be vulnerable to depression whenever he is confronted with problems which are beyond his ability to solve, throughout his life.... Vulnerable to reactivation of the symptoms of PTSD throughout his life 
          "" [Blue 225 T].”  
         
        
       
       
      Past Economic Loss  
      
    82 As to the figure of $919.73 for past economic loss, challenged only by the Council, I consider that the respondent’s submissions amply justify that modest allowance.  
     
      
       
        
        “54. …… 
         
         
         i. Pre accident the Respondent worked five or six days a week on twelve hour shifts that started from the early hours of the morning through until mid afternoon [Black 66 X]. He washed trucks on Sundays which lasted about four hours [Black 198 P - W].  
          
          
         ii. Past economic loss calculations that Counsel for the Nominal Defendant didn't take issue with were based on $919.73 net per week [Black 831 T]. (Plaintiffs outline of Submissions on Damages, handed up to His Honour). Calculation of pre-accident net weekly [earnings] based on tax computations was $919.73 as for the tax computation 1998/1999. [Exhibit 16 Blue 376]”  
         
        
       
       
      Future Economic Loss  
      
    83 Future economic loss totalling $368,007 was assessed on the basis of $500 net per week for the remainder of Mr Swift’s working life said to be 34 years (Red, 76).  
     
      
    84 The first ground of challenge from the Nominal Defendant is absence of reasons for so concluding. The remaining grounds of challenge are contained in the Nominal Defendant’s written submissions, based upon what was submitted to be a significant residual earning capacity, irrespective of any continuing disability, particularly based on the medical opinion said to have been expressed by the orthopaedic specialist Dr Prakash in his report of 12 November 2001 (Blue, 508). If this ground were to succeed, there would need to be a corresponding reduction in the allowance for future loss of superannuation.  
     
      
    85 I quote below from the relevant part of those submissions, before turning to the available evidence.  
     
      
       
        
        “137. Further, his Honour fails to consider the medical opinion expressed by the orthopaedic specialist opinion of Dr Prakash contained in a report of 12 November 2001 [Blue 508]. Indeed, his Honour misquotes the opinion of Dr Prakash at Red J 75B-F. His Honour suggested that Dr Prakash described the respondent as incapable of returning to his pre-accident capacity because of pain in his back and left shoulder. However, Dr Prakash clearly stated at Blue 514O-P Dr Prakash could ‘see no reason why this gentlemen should not be able to return to work as a truck driver’.  
         
         
        138. Dr Prakash noted that the respondent had sustained a mild compression fracture of the T8 vertebrae as well as a fracture of the outer end of the clavicle [Blue 513N-P]. Dr Prakash was unable to detect any abnormality in relation to the function of his right shoulder nor was there any abnormality in relation to the function of his thoracic spine [Blue 573A-Q]. His Honour has had no regard to this evidence in assessing future economic loss.  
         
         
        139. It is contended in the circumstances that the assessment of future economic loss at $500 net per week was not a proper reflection of the evidence, and critically the evidence of the respondent himself as to his demonstrated work capacity. It is contended that a more appropriate award reflecting a loss of earning capacity into the future was $150 net per week which, on the multiplier of 34 years, less 15% amounts to $110,402. Future loss of superannuation would also need to be appropriately reduced.”  
        
       
      
    86 Like the Nominal Defendant, the Council challenged the figure of $368,007 for future economic loss. That challenge is based on what was submitted on the evidence to be an understatement of Mr Swift’s residual capacity for work in the future; written submissions paras 102 to 135 dealing with that issue and the extent and consequences of his physical injury under the heading “35% of a most extreme case”.  
     
      
    87 There is evidence of Mr Swift suffering continued post-accident back pain, as well as some pre-accident back pain but not such as to be debilitating. There is also evidence of his ultimately failed (but I interpolate genuine) attempts post-accident to return to driving and his fitness only for light duties since January 2000 (Black, 245). The respondent’s chronology amply demonstrates his genuine attempts at finding work and that their outcome was ultimately limited to light security duties (Orange, 109). That evidence demonstrates Mr Swift’s genuine attempts to rehabilitate himself and to maximise his residual earning capacity. For example in April 2002 he obtained his first aid certificate and a security licence, being unable earlier to afford the cost of the course (the $5,000 cost was paid for by the insurance company).  
     
      
    88 That led to his obtaining security work, described by the Council in its written submissions in these terms (omitting references):  
     
      
       
        
        “128. In late July 2002 the Respondent obtained casual security work with Security Network. He worked 3-4 days per week for 7-hour shifts. He ceased this work in December 2002 when the contract was completed. The Respondent later applied for work with Chubb Security, however he failed the medical test. In October and November 2002 the Respondent was also doing long shifts engaged in other security work. However he stated he was unable to continue with that work because of pain in his back and stress symptoms. However, when cross-examined, the Respondent conceded that he believed he was able to do security work on a full-time basis and that he had done full working weeks in the past. He admitted that he was doing all the work that had been offered to him. He further conceded that he had suffered nausea and migraines (the stress symptoms) prior to the accident. His Honour never assessed this evidence and its impact on the Respondent’s post injury capacity to work.  
         
         
        129. In November 2002 the Respondent undertook a course in the responsible service of alcohol and worked as a security officer for four hours per fortnight at the WIN Entertainment Centre. He said that he did “all right” at this. His hours are dependent upon what is on at the entertainment centre. He continues in this employment and is now working about 4-6 hours per week. He earns up to $400 per week. …”  
        
       
      
    89 Council submitted that this did not truly represent Mr Swift’s capacity to earn but understated it. It is complained that the trial judge did not extrapolate from the four to six hours per week which he worked to what he would earn on a full-time basis. In addition to working at the WIN Entertainment Centre, Mr Swift had commenced employment mobile patrolling in about July 2003 with Gerringong Security. There he worked two nights a week for six-hour shifts. He continues in this employment. In that employment he earned approximately $200 gross per week. It was put that Mr Swift “admitted that he might have been working for Security Network, Night Guard and WIN Entertainment all at one time”; Black, 247-8.  
     
      
    90 The Council then points to Mr Swift spending time as at April 2004 in addition to working part-time on “getting the children ready for school, driving the children to school, doing some housework …, spending time on the computer looking for job opportunities and … fishing on his boat”. The complaint is made that these activities should have been considered by the trial judge as representing some additional capacity for work, yet the trial judge made no reference to this in either his assessment of the most extreme case nor as regards his lost earning capacity; see para 132 of the Council’s written submissions.  
     
      
    91 Likewise reference was made to his capacity to do the shopping; see written submissions at para 133. Finally, there are some submissions about whether or not Mr Swift was able to lift his daughter or carry a bag containing two x two litres of coke, but I do not consider anything really hangs on that.  
     
      
    92 The respondent concedes that the trial judge did not give meticulous reasons. But the respondent submits that he was not required to do so since the evidence justified a conclusion that he had lost earning capacity roughly quantified at $500 net per week, based on the following evidence. It is accurately summarised in the respondent’s written submissions below:  
     
      
       
        
        “57. …  
         
         
         i. The Respondent gave evidence that he was next in line to become permanent with Heggies and he was pretty much happy to stay a truck driver pretty much till he retired and that he would still like to be a truck driver because it was well paid and it provided a good life for his family [Black 67 0- Q].  
          
          
         ii. The Respondent has an excellent pre accident work history and post accident has made valiant attempts to rehabilitate himself and maximise his residual earning capacity.  
          
          
         iii. His Honour had before him in Exhibit 16 Schedule A [Blue 376] showing calculation of net pre accident weekly income base and tax computation 1998-1999 was $919-73 net and also Exhibit 17 [Blue 379] showing a schedule of the post accident work history and in Exhibit 18 [Blue 381] Schedule C the Respondent's earnings for 2002/2003 based on Group Certificates and Schedule D [Blue 384] and the Respondent's earnings from 1 July 2003 to date of hearing showing average net weekly earnings of $386-00. Hence the difference between pre accident net weekly earnings and the post accident net weekly earnings is a net weekly loss to the Respondent of $533-37.  
          
          
         iv. The Respondent's medical evidence was consistent in that Respondent would not be able to return to his pre accident work and was only fit for non manual jobs [Dr Collins Blue 187F, Dr Davidson Blue 181T, Dr Ng Blue 117E-L, Dr Schwarzer Blue 245 , Dr Fernandez Blue 205F].  
          
          
         v. Dr Hume who was qualified by the Appellant assessed the Respondent on 18 December 2002. Dr Hume provided a report dated 18 December 2002 [Exhibit G] [Blue 517] in which he expressed opinions that the Appellant was not capable of working to his pre accident capacity [Blue 523 I-J].”  
         
        
       
      
    93 In addition, as the Nominal Defendant conceded, Mr Swift was unlikely on the evidence to be able to return to the truck-driving work he was doing before; Black, 831.  
     
      
    94 Finally, as regards Dr Prakash’s report quoted by the trial judge at Red, 75, the respondent points out, correctly, that the trial judge confused his report with that of Dr Hume at Blue, 523. While Dr Prakash was wrongly quoted as describing Mr Swift as “being incapable of working to his pre-accident capacity because of pain in his back and left shoulder”, Dr Hume, whose qualifications appear at Blue, 525 as a specialist orthopaedic surgeon, did so describe Mr Swift’s condition. Thus at para 11.1 Dr Hume answers the question, “Whether the plaintiff is capable of working to his pre-accident capacity” in the negative and answers the further question, “if not, why not?” as because “He is complaining of pain in the back and in the left shoulder. Jolting makes the pain worse.”  
     
      
    95 There is then a further question, “Whether there are any restrictions on his ability to work full-time in his chosen career” which requires any such restrictions to be listed and requiring Dr Hume to advise whether these restrictions are accident related. Dr Hume’s answer was “See above. He still suffers the after effects of the accident.”  
     
      
    96 Dr Hume then answers the question, “If there are restrictions due to the accident, please provide your opinion as to whether the plaintiff would be able to work full-time or part-time in other capacities”, in these terms. “He is working part-time. He has not been offered full-time work”.  
     
      
    97 Finally, at the end of para 13 at Blue, 524 the following is stated by Dr Hume, “I was most impressed by Mr Swift’s determination to find work of some kind. He appears to have been frustrated on many occasions in his efforts to return to full-time work. I consider that following a course of injections and appropriate help to find work he could become a much more productive worker than he is at present”.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion  
      
    98 I consider that the determination of damages reached by the trial judge, though lacking in detailed reasons, was open to him based on the evidence to which I refer above. In particular I would not disturb the trial judge’s conclusion that future economic loss was to be assessed for the balance of Mr Swift’s working life at $500 net per week so as to total $368,007. That figure finds support in the calculation to be found in the respondent’s written submissions at para 57(iii) quoted above, which shows a net weekly loss of a higher amount, namely $533-37.  
     
      
       
      OVERALL CONCLUSION, COSTS AND ORDERS  
      
    99 I consider that the trial judge’s determination of damages does not warrant appellate intervention, save that I conclude that no damages are payable by the Council to the respondent, given that the Council’s appeal as to liability should wholly succeed. I consider that the appeal by the Nominal Defendant should be dismissed with costs, as should its cross-claim against the Council. I consider, however, that the respondent was justified, even prompted, in bringing proceedings against the Council, by reason of the Nominal Defendant denying liability as it did disputing, inter alia, that it was an “unidentified vehicle”. That action made inevitable the joining of the Council by the respondent. The cost orders I have proposed are intended to reflect that outcome on broad terms, including in particular order 3. This is by way of Bullock order reflecting Council’s success on liability and failure on damages and the action of the Nominal Defendant in taking the stance it did. To my mind what was said by Priestley JA in Almeida v Universal Dye Works Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2001] NSWCA 156 at [9] and [13] can be drawn on in support of that conclusion; here the threshold issue was the status of the driver as unidentified (as distinct from who was the occupier of premises).  
     
      
       
        
        ’[9] What was submitted for Mrs Almeida was that the conduct of the Universal which justified the orders she was seeking was the position of the Universal vis-a-vis the other two respondents and the uncertainty that their relationships created as to whether it was safe to do other than proceed against all three. The specific incidents of conduct relied on were that Universal had accepted the quotation for the roofing work done by Mr Almeida's employer, that Universal and Newtown had a common directorship and that Mr Montebello had conducted business on behalf of all three respondents with Mr de Sylva the person in charge of the work being done at the time Mr Almeida fell to his death.  
         
         
        ……… 
         
         
        [13] Looked at from the point of view of the plaintiff, she was faced with the task of proving that some party was an occupier of the factory roof, either in an undefined sense or in a statutory sense; she had joined what she had some reason to believe was the company which had contracted to have the work done, the company lessee, and the company owner of the premises. The questions of occupation and whether Universal was the head contractor were put in issue by Universal.  
        This alone would in my opinion have been sufficient conduct on the part of Universal to warrant the making of the orders against it which Mrs Almeida now seeks 
        .” [emphasis added]  
        
       
      
    100 I recognise a difference between this case and Almeida (supra) though I do not consider it a sufficient basis of distinction. The ground sought to render the Council concurrently liable, was the state of the road or more precisely trench or gutter; whilst the Nominal Defendant was sought to be rendered liable on the basis that the unidentified driver had (by veering across to Mr Swift’s side of the road) caused Mr Swift to take the evasive action that led to his accident. In Almeida it might be said that there was a closer connection between the two defendants and the precipitating events of the accident. It was a question which of the two was the occupier. But even there, Universal was also sought to be rendered liable as head contractor.  
     
      
    101 In Balesfire Pty Ltd t/as the Gutter Shop & Ors v Jamie Adams & Ors [2006] NSWCA 112 Almeida was followed. It was again a building case. Gutter Shop was a guttering firm that had contracted to supply and install gutters on the property. It had engaged the plaintiff as a subcontractor to do the installation which led to the plaintiff’s injury by reason of the unsafe state of the roof for an installer, particularly by reason of the setback of a safety fence. The Bullock order was made against Gutter Shop, which it sought to displace on appeal. Gutter Shop disputed it was liable, forcing the plaintiff to join as defendants the owner and her husband in addition to their building company. Their respective roles in the workplace were distinct, though not, it might be said, wholly independent. Mason P observed:  
     
      
       
        
        ”[107] There is an air of unreality in Gutter Shop challenging the Bullock order while in the same breath arguing that Mr and Mrs Ekonomou [the owner and her husband] and Jemm [their building company] were in truth always liable to the plaintiff and therefore ought to contribute to any substantive verdict awarded against Gutter Shop. In any event, the substantive disposition of this appeal means that the trial costs orders have to be revisited as regards Mr and Mrs Ekonomou. 
         
         
        [108] There was no dispute about the relevant principles concerning a Bullock order and in particular the need for the plaintiff to show that it was reasonable to have joined the successful defendants. ……”  
        
       
      
    102 Here to my mind there would be a similar air of unreality in resisting a Bullock order. The Nominal Defendant not only denied liability but sought to argue that the Council was always liable to Mr Swift, as clearly evinced by the Nominal Defendant’s cross-claim against the Council. It was in my view wholly reasonable for Mr Swift as plaintiff to have joined the Council, though the latter was ultimately successful.  
     
      
    103 I propose orders as follows: 
     
      
      (1) Appeal No. 40975/05 by the Nominal Defendant against the respondent be dismissed with costs as also the Nominal Defendant’s cross-claim against the Council so that costs of the appeal are to be paid by the Nominal Defendant in each case.  
      (2) Appeal No 40049/06 by the Council against the respondent is upheld.  
      (3) In appeal No 40049/06 the Nominal Defendant to pay 70% of the Council’s costs and otherwise there be no order as to costs.  
      
    104 McCOLL JA: I agree with Santow JA.

     MARK ALFRED CLARKSON v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 26 November 2004, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of a total of 16 offences, being 5 offences contrary to s 10(1)(a) of the Passports Act 1938 (Cth) (the Passports Act); 7 offences contrary to s 10(1)(b) of the Passports Act; and 4 offences contrary to s 184 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act). On 11 April 2005, the appellant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Hosking DCJ to a total period of imprisonment of 2 years and 4 months to commence on 26 November 2004, with the appellant to be released on 25 March 2007.  
     
      
    2 The appellant appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence. The appeal and the application for leave to appeal against sentence were heard at the same time as an application for an order in the nature of certiorari and for orders to quash the convictions and sentences and the warrants signed by Hosking DCJ requiring imprisonment, as well as an order for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus (the prerogative writ application). The prerogative writ application was referred to the Supreme Court by an order of Adams J on 4 December 2006. That application has become matter no CA 40803/06 in the Court of Appeal. 
     
      
    3 In addition, there is before the Court of Appeal in proceedings CA 40803/06 a case in which Hosking DCJ stated eight questions of law for the determination of the Court. There is also application for an Order to Show Cause on remitter from the High Court of Australia pursuant to an order Gummow J made on 14 February 2007. That application, which has been merged with matter no CA 40803/06, raises the same issues as those raised on the stated case.  
     
      
    4 The appellant’s Notice of Appeal and Application for Leave to Appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal contained, in total, 48 grounds. Many of these grounds overlap or are repetitive. The stated case comprises eight questions, all of which are to be found in the grounds of appeal. The appellant filed 114 pages of written submissions in support of the appeal and other applications, as well as a number of supplementary submissions and submissions in reply to the Crown submissions. Again, many of the submissions are repetitive. The appellant also made oral submissions.  
     
      
    5 Notwithstanding the overlap and repetition, a number of issues clearly emerged and these were in effect identified by the appellant in his oral submissions. Accordingly, I propose to deal with the matters that were argued orally in the order in which they were advanced by the appellant. I will then deal with any outstanding issues which emerge from the grounds of appeal and which the appellant did not argue orally. The appellant, in his oral submissions, invited the Court to deal with the criminal appeal first, before determination of the questions raised in the stated case and his application for prerogative relief. This course, to which the Crown agreed, was appropriate, as the questions raised in the stated case were entirely covered by the grounds of appeal against conviction, and the outcome of the stated case is dependent upon one of the major issues on the appeal. Because of the cross-over of issues in the two sets of proceedings, this judgment and the judgment of the Court of Appeal in proceedings CA 40803/06 should be read together.  
     
      
       
      Issue 1: the s 10(1)(b) offences – the third party applications: counts 1 to 4 and 10 to 12: grounds 28 and 29 
       
      
    6 The appellant was charged with seven offences under s 10(1)(b) of the Passports Act. Four of those offences were committed prior to 26 May 2001, at which time s 10(1)(b) provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “10(1) A person shall not knowingly or recklessly make any false or misleading statement, whether orally or in writing: 
         
         
        … 
         
         
          
          (b) in support of an application by another person for an Australian passport or for a renewal or endorsement of an Australian passport.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 Section 10(1)(b) was amended on 26 May 2001 as part of the harmonisation with the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Criminal Code). In its amended form it provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “10(1) A person shall not make any false or misleading statement, whether orally or in writing: 
         
         
          
          … 
          
         
         
          
          (b) in the course of supporting an application by another person for an Australian passport or for a renewal or endorsement of an Australian passport.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The amendment did not introduce any substantive difference in the elements of the offence. 
       
      
    8 The maximum penalty for an offence committed under s 10(1)(b) is $5,000 or imprisonment for 2 years.  
     
      
    9 The Crown case in respect of the s 10(1)(b) offences was that, in respect of each offence, the appellant made a false statement in an application for a passport to be issued to another person. The false statement was that the appellant stated on the application form that he had known the person in whose name the application was made for a particular period of time. The persons named on the applications for passports subject of counts 1 to 4 were Virginia Yan (count 1), Kristina Jana Nievens (count 2), Alexanders Ivars Elmas (count 3) and Porsche Francis Lee (count 4). The “identifier” of the applicant on each application was Mark A Clarkson of 10/189 Liverpool Street, Sydney. The individual details in respect of counts 1 to 4 were as follows.  
     
      
    10 Count 1: on 4 April 2000, an application for a passport in the name of Virginia Yan was lodged at Kensington Post Office. It was supported by a birth certificate purportedly issued by the New South Wales Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, in the name of Virginia Yan. The birth certificate was false. No such official birth certificate had ever been issued and the details on it were false. 
     
      
    11 Count 2: on 6 April 2001, an application for a passport in the name of Kristina Jana Nievens was lodged at the Broadway Post Office. It, too, was accompanied by a New South Wales birth certificate which had never been issued by the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the information on which was false. One of the telephone numbers specified on the application was subscribed to by the appellant. The address on the application was a Post Office Box at which during a subsequent search an envelope, addressed to the appellant at that address, was located.  
     
      
    12 Count 3: on 29 May 2000, an application for a passport in the name of Alexanders Ivars Elmas was lodged at the Broadway Post Office. That application was supported by a birth certificate purportedly issued in Victoria, which had never been issued and which recorded false information. The address given for the applicant on the passport application was 4/375 Crown Street, Surry Hills. That address was a Post Office Box, which was rented in the name of Thomas Lacplesis of 10/189 Liverpool Street, Sydney. Thomas Lacplesis was the name used by the appellant in one of the applications which is the subject of one of the offences under s 10(1)(a) of the Passports Act.  
     
      
    13 Count 4: on 7 June 2000, an application for a passport in the name of Porsche Francis Lee was lodged at the Bondi Junction Post Office. It was supported by a birth certificate purportedly issued in Victoria, which had not been issued by the Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages and which recorded false information. The appellant, as the identifier of the applicant on this application, gave a telephone number which was subscribed to by a Janis Perkons of 35/63 MacPherson Street, Waverley. This was the address that the applicant Lee nominated as his address on the application. It was also the address that the appellant gave in the applications for passport that he made which are the subject of counts 6 and 7. 
     
      
    14 Counts 1 to 4 were committed prior to the harmonisation of the Passports Act with the Criminal Code on 26 May 2001. 
     
      
    15 The offences alleged in counts 10 to 12 contained the same false statement as in counts 1 to 4, that is, a statement by the appellant that he had known the applicants for a particular period of time. The details of the false statements were as follows: 
     
      
    16 Count 10: on 15 January 2001, an application for a passport in the name of Peter Johan Tango was lodged at the Bondi Junction Plaza Retail Post Office. It was supported by a Victorian birth certificate. The appellant was the applicant’s identifier. He specified his address as 10/189 Liverpool Street, Sydney, being the address he nominated on counts 1 to 4. 
     
      
    17 Count 11: on 5 October 2001, an application for a passport in the name of Roman Stinkovoy was lodged at the Camperdown Business Centre Post Office. It was supported by a South Australian birth certificate. The appellant was named as the emergency contact, with a given address of 10/189 Liverpool Street, Sydney. The person who signed as identifier was Jason Edward Papps, which was the name used by the appellant on the passport application the subject of count 9. 
     
      
    18 Count 12: on 4 December 2001, an application for a passport in the name of Jason Eris was lodged at the Punchbowl Licensed Post Office. It was supported by a South Australian birth certificate. The emergency contact and identifier was listed as Stewart Barton. The passport number given for Stewart Barton was the passport number issued pursuant to the matter which is the subject of count 7.  
     
      
    19 The appellant’s essential submission in respect of these offences was that the Crown case was fundamentally flawed, in that it had equated the existence of false birth certificates with the appellant having made a false statement. He said that this error was apparent in the Crown’s opening to the jury where senior counsel for the Crown explained that the appellant had signed the application of, for example, Virginia Yan, (count 1) stating he had known that person for the specified period. It was the Crown case that that was a false statement because a person with those details, that is Virginia Yan, born on the date stated in the application, did not exist. (Appeal book 226) Later, in the opening, Crown counsel summarised the case in respect of the third party applications in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… essentially, the allegation in respect of these counts 1 to 4 and count 10 is that the accused made a false statement and the false statement was that he had known the applicant for a particular amount of time and the allegation is that he knew that that was a false statement because no such person with those birth details in fact existed. 
         
         
        In terms of counts 11 and 12 … the Crown has to prove that the accused intentionally made a false statement, so the wording has changed, it’s intentionally instead of knowingly … and secondly, that the false statement was made in the course of supporting an application by another person for an Australian passport.”  
        
       
      
    20 The Crown’s separate reference to counts 11 and 12 was to explain that, notwithstanding the change in the wording of the section, which was due to the harmonisation of the Passports Act with the Criminal Code, the offences were essentially the same. (Appeal book 230-231) 
     
      
    21 Counsel for the appellant at trial applied to have the indictments in respect of the s 10(1)(b) offences quashed. The trial judge rejected the application. His Honour held that what the Crown was seeking to do was to: 
     
      
       
        
        “… say to the jury that they would be satisfied … that there was no person with the given name of [for example] Virginia Yan born on a particular day specified in a falsified birth certificate in Victoria, and that if the jury is satisfied of that fact beyond reasonable doubt, it follows inevitably that in claiming as alleged that [the appellant] knew that person for a period of 5 years and 6 months that that statement must have been a false statement.” (Appeal book 339) 
        
       
      
    22 The Crown repeated the basis of the case it sought to make under these counts in the closing address to the jury, namely, that the offences had been proved because “no such person with those birth details in fact existed” and his Honour repeated the basis upon which the Crown advanced its case on these counts in his summing-up to the jury. 
     
      
    23 The Crown had relied upon coincidence evidence to prove these charges. It had given notice in writing as required by s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). I have already referred to some of the coincidences in the evidence. In addition, there was evidence that in relation to the birth certificates purportedly issued by the Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, the birth certificate number was not a number format used by that Registry (Appeal book 856). Likewise, in respect of the birth certificates purportedly issued by the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Office of South Australia, the evidence was that the number format was not used by that Registration Office (Appeal book 858). In the case of the false New South Wales birth certificates, there was evidence that the registration number shown on the certificate was not a registration number that related to persons by the name of Yan or Nievens (Appeal book 854-855).  
     
      
    24 There was also the coincidence of the use of telephone numbers. For example, in the case of the application in the name of Nievens, the emergency contact was listed as Mark Clarkson of 10/198 Liverpool Street, Sydney, and one of the telephone numbers, namely, 9571 8295, was used in respect of all the passport applications, including those made by the appellant himself, being the subject of counts 5 to 9: s 10(1)(a) offences (Appeal book 855).  
     
      
    25 There was also expert handwriting evidence. The expert document examiner used the passport application form in the name of Lacplesis (count 5) as the base document for his assessment. The expert handwriting evidence established that all of the handwriting on the Lacplesis passport application, except for the “Official Use Only” section, was written by one person. It also established that the author of the Lacplesis passport application was the author of the Clarke, Hardy and Papps applications (Appeal book 859).  
     
      
    26 The expert handwriting evidence further established that the author of the passport application in the name of Lacplesis was the author of the applications for passports in the names of Elmas, Tango, Stinkovoy and Eris, being the offences subject of counts 3, 10, 11 and 12 respectively, as well as being the person who completed the identifier section in the Yan, Nievens and Lee applications, being the subject of counts 1, 2 and 4 respectively. 
     
      
    27 It followed from this evidence that, if accepted, the only inference to be drawn was that the handwriting on the passport application subject of counts 3, 10, 11 and 12 was the appellant’s, and that it was the same handwriting on the identifier section of the applications subject of counts 1, 2 and 4 and thus, the handwriting of the appellant.  
     
      
    28 The appellant’s case on this issue, both at trial and on appeal, is straightforward. He says that the fact that there were false birth certificates is not conclusive as to whether the appellant had made a false statement contrary to s 10(1)(b). He gave evidence that he knew the persons concerned under those names and had known them for some time (Book 3 p 77). The appellant’s counsel addressed the jury to that effect. For example, in relation to the application in the name of Ms Yan, he reminded the jury of the appellant’s evidence that Ms Yan had travelled under that name, and on that passport, overseas. The appellant also gave evidence that he had visited the person he knew as Ms Yan, at the Villawood Detention Centre, where she was detained under that name.  
     
      
    29 Counsel for the appellant also pointed out to the jury that, in the case of Ms Nievens, that there was no specific evidence, for example, that she was not in Australia for at least 5 years and 8 months, nor was there evidence as to how long she had called herself Kristina Nievens. Counsel also drew attention to differences in handwriting and the like on the application forms as being indicative of its authenticity. 
     
      
    30 Senior counsel for the Crown conceded that if there had only been one offence involved under s 10(1)(b), it may have been difficult for the Crown to have proved its case. However, when regard was had to the coincidence evidence, the Crown case was not merely that the existence of a false birth certificate established that the appellant had made a false statement. Rather, the coincidence evidence established that the appellant knew that the name on the birth certificate was false, so that he could not have known a person by that name for the stated period of time. Accordingly, there was evidence to support the elements of the offence and the jury had accepted beyond reasonable doubt that the offences had been established.  
     
      
    31 Thus far, I have dealt with this issue on the basis upon which it was argued orally by the appellant.  
     
      
    32 The written submissions in support of these issues had a different focus. That different focus is reflected in the formulation of the grounds themselves. The grounds were expressed in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “28. That the learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in not discharging the Jury on the Defence Application made after the Crown changed several times the particulars of the False Statement alleged in the Counts preferred pursuant to the  
        Passports Act 
         1938 [Cth] (Counts 1-12). 
         
         
        29. That the learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in allowing the Crown to put to the Jury several False Statements to support each count preferred pursuant to the  
        Passports Act 
         1938 [Cth] (Counts 1-12) every Jury member free to choose one, another or all the False Statements alleged, with no certainty of a unanimous verdict on the False Statement particularised in the Indictment.” 
        
       
      
    33 The appellant argued that the Crown opened to the jury in different terms to the particulars of the charge previously provided to the appellant and then over successive days changed the particulars of the charge. In my opinion, this argument is not correct. Although the Crown did provide particulars in a somewhat expanded form, they were not different in substance. Accordingly, there was no basis for the discharge of the jury as claimed by the appellant. 
     
      
    34 The appellant also complains that he may have been convicted: 
     
      
       
        
        “… by the Jury finding that the Appellant did not know them by the name they used to apply for the Passport or that he did not know them for the stated period of time or both (but which).” (Appellant’s submissions 28.7) 
        
       
       
      The appellant made the same point at para 29.7 of his submissions. 
       
      
    35 The other submissions in support of grounds 28 and 29 are further explications of this central point. To demonstrate this, the appellant made the point that he had known, for example, a Virginia Yan and that it was subsequently ascertained that a person by the name of Kristina Nievens was known to the Commonwealth. 
     
      
    36 However, the Crown case was based on the non-existence of persons named in the passport applications. This has been explained in some detail above.  
     
      
    37 Accordingly, these arguments should also be dismissed. 
     
      
    38 In my opinion, when regard is had to the coincidence evidence, there was sufficient evidence, if accepted by the jury, to establish the elements of these offences. It follows that grounds 28 and 29 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Issue 2: s 184 offences: applications for driver licences in false names: counts 13 to 16; grounds 26 and 27 
       
      
    39 Counts 13 to 16 of the indictment alleged that on dates between 13 and 28 June 2000, the appellant pretended to be a named person: namely, Matthew John Clarke – count 13; Thomas Lacplesis – count 14; Michael John Hardy – count 15; and Jason Papps – count 16; with intent to fraudulently obtain property, being a New South Wales driver licence, contrary to the provisions of s 184 of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    40 Section 184 of the Crimes Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whosoever falsely personates, or pretends to be, some other person, with intent fraudulently to obtain any property, shall be liable to imprisonment for seven years.” 
        
       
      
    41 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 184 is a term of imprisonment of 7 years. 
     
      
    42 The formal grounds of appeal that relate to this issue were in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “26. That the learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in not finding that there was no case to answer in relation to the False Personation Counts (Counts 13-16) in the Indictment and in not directing the Jury to acquit the Appellant on these counts on the Defence application made at the end of the Crown case.” 
         
         
        27. That the learned Trial Judge erred in law and fact in directing the Jury as to the elements of the False Personation Counts preferred pursuant to Section 184, of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Counts 13-16).” 
        
       
      
    43 The appellant’s defence to these grounds was that it is not an offence for the purposes of s 184 to merely apply for a licence in the name of an alias. He contends that when the trial judge rejected his “no case” submission and when directing the jury, in respect of these counts, his Honour erred in law as to the elements of the offence.  
     
      
    44 The evidence in respect of these four charges was that, on the occasions specified in the indictments, the appellant presented himself at a motor registry and applied for a learner driver licence. He filled out an application form in each of the names of Clarke, Lacplesis, Hardy and Papps. The appellant provided a false birth certificate, purportedly issued by the Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages in support of each application. Evidence was given that there was no registration of birth in any of the four names and that the birth certificate number on the respective birth certificates was not a number format used by the Victorian Registry. (Appeal book 851)  
     
      
    45 The appellant’s contention is that to be guilty of the offence of ‘fraudulent personation’, the Crown must prove that the person impersonated is an actual person, or at least was once a living person, and not a fictitious person. The appellant had not tried to personate or pretend to be an actual person, but, rather, was adopting an alias when making the applications for the learner driver licence.  
     
      
    46 Following the close of the Crown case, counsel for the appellant at trial applied to his Honour for a verdict by direction on these counts, on the basis that on the evidence, a prima facie case had not been made out. (Appeal book 569) 
     
      
    47 In his judgment on the ‘no case’ application, the trial judge, having observed that although s 184 had been part of the Crimes Act since its inception, it had not been the subject of any reported decision. His Honour reviewed a body of English authority dealing with personation charges and observed that unless the particular offence referred to a fictitious person: see, for example, the Representation of the People Act 1949 (12, 13 and 14 Geo 6, c.68); s 47(2), it appeared that “ordinarily, personation is limited to the impersonation of someone by a real person living or dead”. (Appeal book 572) That, of course, was the appellant’s point. He claimed that he had not purported to do so. Rather, he was using an alias. 
     
      
    48 His Honour also referred to modern Australian examples of the offence of personation which restricted the offence to the impersonation of a real person, sometimes to a person of a particular class. He referred to s 204 of the Police Act 1990 (NSW) (now repealed), which provided that it was an offence to impersonate a police officer and s 265 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) which provides that it is an offence to impersonate a correctional officer. 
     
      
    49 His Honour observed, however, that s 184 of the Crimes Act was in different terms to the offences created by the legislation to which he had referred. Under s 184, the offence was not only falsely personate some other person. Rather, there was an alternative charge provided for in the section, namely, where a person “pretends to be some other person”. His Honour considered that the additional words in s 184 must have been intended to serve a purpose and were not included simply as an alternative way of describing the offence of false personation. His Honour considered that the additional words had a similar effect to the provisions of s 2 of the Voters Act (UK) which refers to a person, living, dead or fictitious. His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, on its proper construction, s 184 creates two separate kinds of offences. One is personation in its historical sense, the other is  
        pretending to be another person who need not have ever existed 
        . It is the latter that the Crown has alleged here to prove the charge that the Crown has brought in each instance.” (Emphasis added) (Appeal book 575) 
        
       
      
    50 His Honour considered that an offence under s 184 comprised three elements; first, that the accused person had pretended to be another person; secondly, that the accused had done so with intent to obtain property; and thirdly, that that had been done fraudulently. His Honour considered that there was sufficient evidence for the Crown to be able to prove each of those elements and thus dismissed the application. His Honour repeated these three elements when directing the jury in respect of these offences (although in doing so he encapsulated the elements of the relevant intent, done fraudulently, together) (Appeal book 810).  
     
      
    51 The appellant also submitted that in his summing-up, the trial judge made a further error, when describing to the jury the first element of the offence. His Honour said that the Crown had to prove, beyond reasonable doubt “that the accused pretended to be another person”. It was submitted that his Honour left out the word “falsely”, which was an essential ingredient of the offence and, secondly, had substituted the phrase “another person” for “some other person”. The last point can be dealt with quickly. There is no difference in meaning between “another person” and “some other person”. In each case, the word or phrase simply means a person who is not the person making the application.  
     
      
    52 That leaves the question whether his Honour erred in omitting the word “falsely” when he identified the first element in the offence. The word “pretend” is defined in the Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary to mean “claim or assert falsely so as to deceive”. The definition in the Macquarie Dictionary is: 
     
      
       
        
        “… to put forward a false appearance of … to venture or attempt falsely (to do something)…” 
        
       
      
    53 It is apparent that the ordinary meaning of the word “pretend” includes the notion that the claim is false. It follows that his Honour would have been engaging in tautology to have used the word “falsely” as the appellant contended was required. It follows that his Honour’s direction in his summing-up was not erroneous as alleged.  
     
      
    54 Accordingly, no basis to interfere with the conviction has been established on this issue.  
     
      
    55 Before leaving this particular matter, however, reference should be made to one further submission made by the appellant, namely, that the offence which the appellant had in fact committed, but with which he had not been charged, was an offence under s 22 of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 (NSW) which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person must not:  
         
         
          
          (a) by a false statement or any misrepresentation or other dishonest means, obtain or attempt to obtain a driver licence or the renewal of a driver licence, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) without lawful authority or excuse, possess a driver licence obtained or renewed using those means. 
          
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units. 
         
         
        (2) A driver licence so obtained or renewed is void, and the Authority may alter the driver licence register accordingly. 
         
         
        (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to a driver licence receipt issued by another jurisdiction.” 
        
       
      
    56 As I understand the submission, it was that it was apparent from the terms of s 22 that the making of a false statement, such as making a claim in the name of an alias, was captured by the provisions of s 22. This demonstrated that s 184 was directed to different conduct, that is, impersonation of a real person. I have already dealt with this submission above. Further, as the Crown submits, the same conduct may constitute an offence under different Acts, or under different provisions of the same Act. Provided there is evidence that the person has committed the offence charged, then it is open to the Crown to prefer such charge notwithstanding that there is some other: see Butler v Attorney General for the State of Victoria (1961) 106 CLR 268; Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57.  
     
      
    57 The appellant did not submit that s 22 had repealed s 184 of the Crimes Act nor, in my opinion, was there any implied repeal: see generally Butler v Attorney General for the State of Victoria per Fullagar J at 275 –276.  
     
      
    58 The appellant also pointed out that the penalty provided for by s 22 was a maximum penalty of 20 penalty units, being a penalty of $2,200, as compared to a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment in respect of an offence under s 184. The appellant had mistakenly said the maximum penalty under s 22 was 12 months imprisonment. However, that does not detract from the point of the submission, which was to reinforce the earlier submission that the appellant had been charged with the wrong offence and that the seriousness of the criminality of the offence which he had committed was much less than that with which he had been charged. This also indicated that the appellant must have been charged under the wrong offence. 
     
      
    59 However, as I have already indicated, it is possible that the same conduct may constitute an offence under more than one provision of an Act, or under different Acts. Provided that the offence charged has been proved beyond reasonable doubt, it is irrelevant that there may have been some other lesser offence with which the accused person could have been charged. My comments in this regard relate to an appeal on conviction only. The existence of a provision with a lesser penalty may have some relevance in respect of sentence, which is dealt with later in these reasons.  
     
      
       
      Issue 3: availability of defences to the charges in counts 5 to 9: the s 10(1)(a) offences and counts 13 to 16: grounds 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 
       
      
    60 This issue relates to grounds 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20. The resolution of this issue will also resolve grounds 21, 22 and 23.  
     
      
    61 The appellant contended that although he had admitted most, if not all, of the facts adduced by the Crown in support of counts 5 to 9 (the s 10(1)(a) passport application offences) and counts 13 to 16 (the s 184 application for driver licence offences), he had defences to those charges of self-defence, duress of circumstance and necessity, but that the trial judge had ruled that those defences were not available. His Honour had also ruled that evidence that the appellant sought to adduce in support of those defences was not admissible.  
     
      
    62 It is necessary in the first instance to determine whether the defences as claimed were available, either as a matter of law or fact, in respect of the offences charged. 
     
      
    63 The appellant gave evidence of his background and work history in Melbourne. In the course of that, he identified the existence of two groups or “crews”, namely, the “Carlton crew” and the “Williams crew”. He gave evidence that he became associated with the “Carlton crew” (Appeal book 607, 628). He then gave evidence of connections to or with certain notorious persons who were or became known criminals, such as Christopher Dale Flannery, who had subsequently disappeared. He also gave evidence about murders and disappearances of persons with whom he was connected in a number of different merchant banking or finance companies. These events related to the 1980s.  
     
      
    64 The appellant then gave evidence of his activities during the 1990s. In the course of giving this evidence, he referred to other notorious Melbourne criminals, including Jason Moran and the killings of and by various notorious criminals.  
     
      
    65 The appellant next gave evidence about events in 2000. At that time, he was living in Sydney, but said he visited Melbourne regularly. He gave evidence that a Frank Benevenuto, regarded in Melbourne as the boss of the “Carlton crew”, was killed, and then, a Richard Maladnavic, a person whom the appellant described as a close associate, and who “was watching [the appellant’s] back in Melbourne, was very publicly executed” (Appeal book 628). The appellant said that, at that stage, he felt that “someone was trying to send [me] a message”. The appellant said that thereafter, he was stalked, and received a number of telephone calls which he said indicated to him that “[I] was not long for this world, that in effect, [I] was next” (Appeal book 629-631). The appellant said that after the death of Maladnavic, and having been stalked, he took precautions. He also referred to Mark Moran, a notorious Victorian underworld figure, being killed, and said, “I knew that the war was going to – the Morans were never going to take that lying down” (Appeal book 636). It appears that Mark Moran, according to the appellant’s evidence, was killed on 15 June 2000. The appellant said that Mark Moran was loosely associated with the “Carlton crew” (Appeal book 637).  
     
      
    66 The appellant gave evidence that he attended the RTA in Sydney on 13 June 2000 and applied for a licence in the name of Matthew John Clarke. He then gave this evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Why did you go to the RTA that day to obtain such a licence in an assumed name? 
         
        A: It was part of a scheme by me to lay a grid, to lay if you like, a maze, that people would get lost in. If they were looking for me, I had made a conscious decision at that time not to get one drivers licence but to get five and five passports. I did them all in very quick succession and it was all part of a deliberate scheme by me to in effect create a swamp that people looking for me would get led into and get lost in.” (Appeal book 636) 
        
       
      
    67 The appellant admitted that, thereafter, he made the applications for passports and licences subject of the charges. Having identified the various applications he made up until the last one, dated 28 June 2000, he was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Since the last date, 28 June 2000, a number of individuals have died, either from the Carlton crew, or the Williams crew, to your knowledge? 
         
        A: That’s so, a fairly large number.” 
        
       
      
    68 Objection was taken to the next question, in which the appellant was asked to identify who had died, on the basis that matters occurring after the date of the charges were irrelevant.  
     
      
    69 The appellant said that he could not go to the police, because he considered that there were corrupt “rogue” elements in the police, some of whom would like to kill him (Appeal book 646).  
     
      
    70 The appellant submitted that, to prove his defences of duress, necessity or self-defence, it was sufficient for him to establish that he had an honest, well-founded belief as to the matters about which he gave evidence and in respect of which he had intended to call other evidence, including evidence of facts and circumstances that arose after the dates of the offence.  
     
      
    71 The evidence that the appellant contends he should have been allowed to give was set out in an affidavit of the appellant sworn 31 May 2006, filed on the appeal. The Crown did not take any objection to the Court reading this material. The appellant contends that his affidavit sets out his honest and well-founded belief as to the fear that he held for his life. The affidavit comprises some 184 paragraphs, as well as two further paragraphs in which he seeks certain orders on the appeal.  
     
      
    72 Besides the historical information as to the appellant’s personal life, the affidavit sets out in more discursive form the evidence which the appellant gave at trial as well as the evidence which he indicated he wished to give in respect of events after the date of the offences. That evidence is of the same type to that which his Honour, correctly, held was inadmissible. Further, much of the evidence was in inadmissible form and other evidence was merely argumentative.  
     
      
    73 At trial, the appellant’s counsel described the defence that the appellant wished to raise as being “duress by virtue of circumstances” (Appeal book 644). On the appeal, the appellant relied upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Hurley and Murray [1967] VR 526 in relation to the defence of duress, and the decision of the Full Court of the Victorian Supreme Court in R v Loughnan [1981] VR 443 in relation to the defence of necessity.  
     
      
    74 In Hurley and Murray, the accused were convicted on 2 counts of having been accessories after the fact to the felony of escape. Two armed escapees had taken shelter in Hurley’s home. Hurley and Murray assisted the escapees by purchasing clothing for them and going to Sydney to purchase a car, Hurley’s de facto wife being held as a hostage during the absences of Hurley and Murray from the house. They alleged at trial that at the time of rendering assistance, their purpose was not to help the escapees to avoid arrest, but that they acted in order to protect themselves and others. Hurley alleged that he acted under duress from a fear of death or injury to himself or his de facto wife. Murray relied upon the defence of duress based upon a fear for the safety of Hurley, Hurley’s de facto, and the elderly boarder who lived in Hurley’s home.  
     
      
    75 The trial judge had ruled that Murray was not entitled to rely on the last matter as a defence, because fear for the safety of such persons could not in law amount to duress upon him. Winneke CJ and Pape J held at 533 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a person who without threat of death or serious violence voluntarily makes himself a party to a criminal enterprise cannot excuse his criminal conduct in participating in that enterprise by showing that after he had embraced the cause he was subjected to threats of violence at the hands of the other parties to ensure that he did not resile from the bargain he had voluntarily entered into.” 
        
       
      
    76 Their Honours held that on the facts, Murray, having voluntarily agreed to the arrangement upon being approached by Hurley to do so, could not rely on a defence of duress. The position with Hurley was different. Their Honours accepted that the defence of duress was open to him, at least insofar as there were continuing threats to his de facto wife. The issue in relation to Hurley was whether his evidence in that regard should have been accepted. 
     
      
    77 The appellant relies not upon the decision of the majority in Hurley and Murray, but upon the judgment of Smith J, particularly at 537. However, Smith J was not setting out the elements of the defence of duress at that point in his judgment. Rather, his Honour was recounting Hurley’s evidence. At 541, his Honour referred to the trial judge’s direction as to the defence of duress, which was in these terms and which Smith J considered was correct: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a defence of duress could arise from a threat of ‘ 
        immediate 
         death or serious personal violence’; and a little later he said that it could arise from a threat of ‘ 
        imminent 
         death or grave physical violence’ [including threats against the person’s de facto wife]” (Original emphasis) 
        
       
      
    78 In R v Loughnan, the Victorian Full Court accepted that there was a defence of necessity to a criminal charge. Young CJ and King J at 447 indicated that they accepted a general proposition to the effect that the law, in some cases, does recognise a defence of necessity. At 448, their Honours stated that there were three elements involved in the defence. They described the first element in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the criminal act or acts must have been done only in order to avoid certain consequences which would have inflicted irreparable evil upon the accused or upon others whom he was bound to protect.” 
        
       
       
      Their Honours observed that the limits of the first element were ill-defined, but clearly included a threat of death.  
       
      
    79 Their Honours identified the other two elements by the labels of “immediate peril and proportion”. They described the first of these two elements to mean: 
     
      
       
        
        “[t]hat the accused must honestly believe on reasonable grounds that he was placed in a situation of imminent peril.” 
        
       
       
      As to the element of proportion, their Honours stated: 
       
       
        
        “[It] simply means that the acts done to avoid the imminent peril must not be out of proportion to the peril to be avoided. Put in another way, the test is: would a reasonable man in the position of the accused have considered that he had any alternative to doing what he did to avoid the peril?” 
        
       
      
    80 The defence of necessity was considered by this Court in R v Rogers (1996) 86 A Crim R 542. Gleeson CJ (Clarke JA and Ireland J agreeing) observed that the defences of necessity and self-defence were closely related.  
     
      
    81 This had been a matter adverted to in Loughnan, where Young CJ and King J said at 449: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the general description of a defence of necessity, is at least analogous to [the defence of self defence] …” 
        
       
       
      Their Honours considered that the defences involved two common elements: 
       
       
        
        “First, an urgent situation of imminent peril must exist in which the accused must honestly believe on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for him to do the acts which are alleged to constitute the offence in order to avoid the threatened danger. Secondly, those acts must not be disproportionate to the threatened danger.” 
        
       
      
    82 In Rogers, Gleeson CJ noted that since the High Court decision in Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) (1987) 162 CLR 645, juries were instructed that the ultimate question to be determined when a defence of self-defence was raised, was whether “the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to what he did”. However, as Gleeson CJ pointed out at 545: 
     
      
       
        
        “The imminence and seriousness of the threat to which the accused was supposedly responding are important, and often critical, factual considerations going to the accused’s supposed belief, and the reasonableness of his belief.”  
        
       
      
    83 At 546, Gleeson CJ agreed with the proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant in that case, that “the elements” of the defence of necessity were not to be approached in a categorical way:  
     
      
       
        
        “The corollary of the notion that the defence of necessity exists to meet cases where the circumstances overwhelmingly impel disobedience to the law is that the law cannot leave people free to choose for themselves which laws they will obey, or to construct and apply their own set of values inconsistent with those implicit in the law. Nor can the law encourage juries to exercise a power to dispense with compliance with the law where they consider disobedience to be reasonable, on the ground that the conduct of an accused person serves some value higher than that implicit in the law which is disobeyed.  
         
         
        This is why, historically, it has been regarded as important to seek to limit the scope of the defence by referring to requirements such as urgency and immediacy. However, I accept the appellant's submission that, consistently with the approach to self-defence taken by the High Court in  
        Zecevic 
        , it is now more appropriate to treat those ""requirements"", not as technical legal conditions for the existence of necessity, but as factual considerations relevant, and often critically relevant, to the issues of an accused person's belief as to the position in which he or she is placed, and as to the reasonableness and proportionality of the response.” 
        
       
      
    84 His Honour concluded at 547: 
     
      
       
        
        “The relevant concept is of necessity, not expediency, or strong preference. If the prisoner, or the jury, were free to consider and reject possible alternatives on the basis of value judgments different from those made by the law itself, then the rationale of the defence, and the condition of its acceptability as part of a coherent legal system, would be undermined. To adopt the language of Dickson J in  
        Perka 
        , the accused must have been afforded no reasonable opportunity for an alternative course of action which did not involve a breach of the law. In  
        United States v Bailey 
         444 US 394 at 410 (1979) Rehnquist J, speaking for the majority in the Supreme Court of the United States, said:  
         
         
          
          ‘Clearly, in the context of a prison escape, the escapee is not entitled to claim a defence by duress or necessity unless and until he demonstrates that, given the imminence of the threat, (escape) was his only reasonable alternative.’ 
          
         
         
        In that context the word ‘demonstrate’ is to be understood as a reference to an evidentiary, not a legal onus, as is made clear by the term ‘showing’ which is used in the paragraph immediately following that which has been quoted.” 
        
       
      
    85 Gleeson CJ added, however: 
     
      
       
        
        “Reasonableness is not designed to allow people to choose for themselves whether to obey the law …” 
        
       
       
      and at 548, the Chief Justice stated that the imminence of the threat was a matter of evidentiary significance, as was the question of whether there were any possible alternative courses of action available, a matter which his Honour described as being “ 
      of central factual importance 
      ”.  
       
      
    86 The Crown submits that the appellant’s case, if based upon duress, has not been made out. There was no evidence that the appellant was required to commit the offences under threat if he failed to do so: see Hurley and Murray at 541; see also R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531. This submission is clearly correct.  
     
      
    87 The Crown accepts that the “defence of duress of circumstance” that trial counsel for the appellant relied upon was intended to raise the defence of necessity. The Crown submits that this defence was not made out, as there was nothing in the circumstances in which the appellant found himself, accepting those circumstances to exist, that required him to obtain passports and licences in false names. As senior counsel for the Crown submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “You can call yourself whatever you want, but it doesn’t entail getting a false passport. It has no logical connection with attempting to avoid detection by unknown persons from the Victorian underworld.” (Appeal transcript 44) 
        
       
      
    88 The Crown’s submission is clearly correct. The appellant’s argument, that he needed a passport to book into backpacker hostels so as to mask his existence with a chameleon-like tapestry of false identities, begs the question as to whether he had no reasonable alternative but to obtain the false documentation to protect himself from some perceived danger. Even assuming it was reasonable for the appellant to frequently change his place of abode, and even to do so under an alias, that did not necessitate his obtaining false documents. The appellant’s conduct in doing so does not answer the description of necessity, as explained by Gleeson CJ in the passage set out above. 
     
      
    89 This disposes of grounds 11, 13 and 16. 
     
      
    90 Further, there was no evidence of imminent threat. The appellant did not contend that he was part of the underworld in which the killings in which he gave evidence were occurring. Rather, he only gave evidence of some association with it. He did not give evidence of why he might have been a target, other than for those associations. I have already referred to the connection which the authorities have recognised between the defence of necessity and the defence of self-defence. In Taikato v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 454; [1996] HCA 28, the appellant was charged with possessing in a public place a thing capable of dispensing an irritant contrary to s 545E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. It was a defence under the section that the person had a reasonable excuse for possessing the offensive material, or possessed it for a lawful purpose. The appellant’s case was that she carried a pressurised canister of formaldehyde, being a substance capable of causing bodily harm, in case anybody attacked her. In short, the appellant sought to raise a defence of self-defence. Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ, pointed out at 5: 
     
      
       
        
        “No legal right of self-defence arises until there is a reasonable apprehension of attack by the person who is assaulted.” 
        
       
       
      It was not sufficient to successfully raise a defence to be carrying the canister in case of attack. The appellant’s position here is no different, for the reasons I have already stated.  
       
      
    91 As the appellant’s own evidence was not sufficient to raise a defence to go to the jury, no error is disclosed in the trial process in relation to the other evidence that the appellant wished to adduce, particularly that of Detective Senior Sergeant Swindells, an officer of the Victorian Police Force.  
     
      
    92 The appellant’s contention in relation to DSS Swindells is formulated in appeal ground 17 in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “That the learned trial judge erred in law and fact in not allowing the Appellant to call DSS Phil Swindells from the Victoria Police to give evidence in support of the defences raised by the Appellant of Self defence, Duress of Circumstance and Necessity.” (Appellant’s book 3 p 63) 
        
       
      
    93 The issue in respect of DSS Swindells arose on the ninth day of trial, when it became apparent that the officer was present at court and there was a question as to whether he should be interposed. The appellant’s trial counsel informed the trial judge that DSS Swindells was going to give evidence about the deaths and the association of underworld figures in Melbourne to the “Carlton and Williams crew”. His Honour indicated that he considered that if that was the “kind of evidence” that was going to be adduced from the police officer, “it fell a long way short of being capable of making out any of [the] defences”. His Honour indicated that, in that circumstance, the evidence was irrelevant. The appellant’s counsel, Mr Lowe, disagreed, and said the evidence was relevant to the appellant’s “state of mind” (Appeal book 681). Counsel also indicated that DSS Swindells would give evidence about the sequence of events up to the time of the date of the offences, but not thereafter, as he considered himself bound by the trial judge’s ruling that such evidence would be irrelevant.  
     
      
    94 Discussion then ensued between his Honour and counsel as to the elements of the defence and, in particular, that it was necessary for the evidence “to be capable of showing that [the appellant] had no other choice but to act in the way he did”. Counsel agreed that was the law (Appeal book 681). Counsel then indicated the appellant had already given evidence about his reluctance to go to the police, but could not because he was afraid of the Victorian and New South Wales police. His Honour indicated that was not sufficient to establish the defence. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that does not get within a bull’s roar of necessity or duress … let alone self defence. It does not even get within cooee of it.” (Appeal book 682) 
        
       
      
    95 In the discussion which followed, his Honour emphasised that the law required the appellant to have committed the offences because “he had no other choice”. It is apparent from counsel’s response that he agreed that that represented the law (Appeal book 683). His Honour then said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lowe, it appears to me that the evidence that the witness you propose to interpose is going to give is completely and utterly irrelevant to any real issue in this trial. I don’t know what you want to do in the light of that ruling. If you want to call him I’ll deal with it question by question if you like. It’s up to you, but that’s my view. Unless you can take me … to a case that shows me that the law that I’ve just put to you and which has been endorsed by the Crown Prosecutor is wrong, that’s the position as far as I’m concerned.” (Appeal book 685) 
        
       
      
    96 Counsel then referred his Honour to Loughnan and Rogers and his Honour indicated that he considered that he should apply the reasoning of the Chief Justice in Rogers. (Appeal book 686) His Honour referred to the statement of the Chief Justice at 547, which I have already set out above, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he accused must have been afforded no reasonable opportunity for an alternative course of action which did not involve a breach of the law.” 
        
       
      
    97 Counsel responded that the appellant had already given evidence about that and that it was a jury question. His Honour stated that the evidence was not capable of establishing that, and he was not going to allow the defence to go to the jury. 
     
      
    98 Counsel sought an opportunity to obtain instructions from his client about releasing the witness. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yes, unless the evidence is going to be different Mr Lowe. Unless the evidence is going to rise above the evidence that I have before me at the moment because I can tell you Mr Lowe that the criminal law is not a joke and I am not going to allow it to be used for a purpose which will make the criminal law look ludicrous in the eyes of the jury in asking them to consider defences which an intelligent five year old would think were laughable.” (Appeal book 687) 
        
       
      
    99 Appellant’s counsel sought instructions and then requested that his Honour release DSS Swindells from his subpoena: 
     
      
       
        
        “[I]n accordance with your Honour’s ruling on the issue of his relevance.” 
        
       
      
    100 It is apparent from the above exchange that ground 17, in terms in which it is framed, is not made out. It was not that his Honour did not allow DSS Swindells to give evidence. Rather, he indicated that having regard to the evidence that it was proposed to adduce from that witness, it was not relevant to the defences sought to be raised, because it fell below what would be required to be proved in respect of any of the constituent elements of those defences, and in particular, of the defence of necessity. Ground 17 should be treated as seeking to challenge that ruling.  
     
      
    101 It is apparent that the evidence that it was intended that DSS Swindells should give was of the same order as the evidence which was given by the appellant himself. In other words, it was evidence which was intended to support the appellant’s evidence of the criminal underworld, to which reference is made above. As I have already concluded that the appellant’s evidence was insufficient to satisfy any of the elements of the defence of necessity, based on that evidence, the evidence proposed to be adduced from DSS Swindells was also irrelevant. Accordingly, there was no error in his Honour ruling as he did. 
     
      
    102 This conclusion also takes account of ground 18, in which it is alleged that his Honour similarly erred in not receiving evidence from other witnesses in support of the defences.  
     
      
    103 Likewise, if evidence of these activities and connections that occurred and existed prior to the commission of the offences was irrelevant for the purposes of the defences, then similar evidence of events occurring thereafter would also be irrelevant. Accordingly, the evidence relating to persons who had been murdered and the appellant’s relationship with them; the fact that certain other underworld persons had been arrested; and the fact that one of these underworld persons was in such fear for his life that he sought to obtain a passport in another name, was irrelevant. In any event, much, if not all, of that evidence would have been in inadmissible form. Accordingly, there was no error in his Honour’s ruling that such evidence was irrelevant. That conclusion disposes of grounds 19 and 20. 
     
      
    104 The appellant then contended in appeal ground 21 that his Honour erred in ruling that that evidence was not relevant but allowing the Crown to elicit evidence of the fear held by the appellant in cross-examination as an attack on his credit, and did not allow the defence to revisit the same material to re-establish the credit of the appellant. There were extensions of this ground in grounds 22 and 23, in which the appellant contends that his Honour erred in not allowing the appellant to call DSS Swindells and other witnesses in relation to the veracity of the fear held by the appellant. 
     
      
    105 The appellant had already given evidence of his fear for his personal safety. Although his Honour had indicated to the parties that the evidence was not sufficient to establish the defences, it was open to the Crown to attack his credit, based upon that evidence. For example, the appellant had suggested in his evidence that it was necessary to have the false identities because he feared for his life, yet he went to places where he was well-known. The Crown submits, correctly, in my opinion, that cross-examination of the appellant on these issues was relevant to his credibility.  
     
      
    106 The appellant contends however that he should have been able to give evidence of these matters in re-examination, the matter having been the subject of cross-examination. It was not open to the appellant to merely reiterate his evidence in re-examination so as to establish his state of mind so as to provide a basis for his proposed defence. An examination of the transcript indicates that was what was being attempted. His Honour indicated that was not permissible in re-examination and that he had already given evidence of his state of mind. Contrary to the appellant’s assertion that he should have been able to give such evidence so as to re-establish his credit as permitted by s 108 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), his counsel did not seek to adduce evidence for that purpose, nor was this evidence intended to do so.  
     
      
       
      Issue 4: should the appellant have been dealt with under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW)? (Grounds 1-8) 
       
      
    107 The appellant suffers from the condition of sleep apnoea. From time to time, that condition has a significant impact on his health. There was a period of time, during which the appellant was upon remand, when the court accepted that he was not sufficiently well to stand trial. For that reason, the original trial date was vacated by his Honour Justice Blanch Chief Judge of the District Court on 8 May 2003 and the matter was adjourned from time to time until the trial date was finally set for 15 November 2004. On two specific occasions during the period, the appellant made an application that the trial be adjourned for directions on the basis that he was unfit to be tried. 
     
      
    108 The appellant contends that when Blanch CJDC first vacated the hearing date, his Honour made a finding that the appellant was “not fit for trial”. That finding having been made, the appellant contends that he should have been dealt with pursuant to Pt IB Div 6 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Crimes Act (Cth)) insofar as the Commonwealth offences were concerned and under the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW) (the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act) insofar as the State charges were concerned. These contentions form the bases of grounds of appeal 1 to 6.  
     
      
    109 The Crown disputes that there was ever a finding that the appellant was “not fit for trial” as alleged, but in any event, it contends that “fitness for trial” within the relevant legislative provisions relates to a person’s mental capacity to engage in the trial process and at no stage was there evidence to support the appellant’s claim that he was “not fit for trial” in that sense.  
     
      
       
      The statutory scheme 
       
       
      Commonwealth legislation 
       
      
    110 Section 20B of the Crimes Act (Cth) provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) Where a court: 
         
         
        … 
         
         
          
          (b) before which a person appears in proceedings for trial of a federal offence on indictment, being proceedings begun after this section commences; 
          
         
         
          
          finds the person charged unfit to be tried, the court must determine whether there has been established a prima facie 
            
          case that the person committed the offence concerned. 
          
         
         
        … 
         
        (5) Where a court finds a person, other than a person in respect of whom proceedings have been referred to it by a magistrate under subsection (1), to be unfit to be tried, the court may order the person to be detained in prison or hospital for so long only as is reasonably necessary to allow the court to determine whether it will make an order under section 20BA dismissing the charge or an order under section 20BB detaining the person in prison or hospital or granting the person bail. 
         
         
        (6) For the purposes of subsection (3), a prima facie 
          
        case is established if there is evidence that would (except for the circumstances by reason of which the person is unfit to be tried) provide sufficient grounds to put the person on trial in relation to the offence.” 
        
       
       
      Section 20BA provides, relevantly: 
       
       
        
        “(4) Where the court determines that there has been established a prima facie 
          
        case that the person committed the offence … the court must, as soon as practicable after making that first-mentioned determination, determine whether, on the balance of probabilities, the person will become fit to be tried, within the period of 12 months after the day the person was found to be unfit to be tried.” 
         
         
        (5) A court must not make a determination under subsection (4) unless the court has obtained, and considered, written or oral evidence from a duly qualified psychiatrist and one other duly qualified medical practitioner.” 
        
       
       
      The phrase “ 
      unfit to be tried 
      ” is not defined in the Commonwealth legislation. However, pursuant to s 16 of the  
      Crimes Act (Cth) 
      , “ 
      unfit to be tried 
      ” includes “ 
      unfit to plead 
      ”. 
       
       
      State legislation 
       
      
    111 Under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, provision is also made for determining questions of unfitness to be tried. The phrase “unfitness to be tried” is not defined in the Act. The question of unfitness may be raised by any party to the proceedings: s 5; the question of a person’s unfitness is to be determined on the balance of probabilities: s 6; the question of unfitness should, so far as is practicable, be raised before the person is arraigned, but may be raised at any time: s 7(1). Section 8 (in its form as at the dates relevant to this matter) prescribes the procedure where the question of unfitness is raised before arraignment. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is raised at any time before the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, the Attorney-General must determine whether an inquiry should be conducted before the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence. 
         
         
        (2) The Attorney-General may, at any time before the inquiry is commenced, determine that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted.” 
        
       
      
    112 It should be said that there appears to be an hiatus in the legislation, in the sense that there is no provision directing ‘how’ the matter gets to the Attorney-General. Such a lacuna is not atypical in modern legislation. Often, legislation appears to be drafted on the basis of assumptions or practices known to those who operate in a particular area. This problem was encountered recently in the Court of Appeal in Re Jayden [2007] NSWCA 35. Presumably, the papers are referred to the Attorney-General by the court with a request that the Attorney-General determine whether an inquiry should be conducted. 
     
      
    113 Sections 10(1)(a) and 10(2) provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “10(1) If, in respect of an offence:  
         
         
          
          (a) the Court determines that an inquiry should be conducted and does not subsequently determine, before the inquiry is commenced, that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted … 
          
         
         
          
          the Court must (except as provided by this section), as soon as practicable after the determination is made or the question is raised, as the case may be, conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried for the offence. 
          
         
         
        (2) The Court must not conduct an inquiry into the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence unless it appears to the Court that the question has been raised in good faith.” 
        
       
      
    114 Before conducting the inquiry, the court may do a number of things, including adjourning the proceedings and requesting a psychiatric or other report in relation to the accused be obtained: s 10(3). 
     
      
    115 The inquiry referred to in s 10 is governed by s 11. Section 11(1) provides that the question of unfitness is to be tried before a jury constituted for that purpose.  
     
      
    116 The central question which arises on this issue is whether before trial there was a question of the appellant’s unfitness to be tried for an offence. This in turn raises the question of the reach of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act and, in particular, whether it extends to fitness arising from a physical condition which does not involve a “mental illness” or “mental condition”.  
     
      
    117 The Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act was enacted as part of a tranche of legislation relating to mental health, the other Acts being the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW) (the Mental Health Act), the Miscellaneous Acts (Mental Health) Repeal and Amendment Act 1990 (NSW) (the Miscellaneous Acts (Mental Health) Act).  
     
      
    118 The objects of the Mental Health Act are set out in s 4 of that Act and in broad terms relate to the care, treatment and control of mentally ill and mentally disordered persons. There are no specified objects of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. However, it is entitled “An Act with respect to criminal proceedings involving persons affected by mental illness and other mental conditions”. “Mental condition” is defined in s 3 to mean “a condition of disability of mind not including either mental illness or developmental disability of mind”. “Mental illness” is not defined but would bear the same meaning as in the Mental Health Act. The appellant does not contend that he suffers from a mental illness, so it is not necessary to refer to that definition. 
     
      
    119 Part 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act is headed “Criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court and District Court relating to persons affected by mental disorders”. “Mental disorders” is not defined in this Act but is defined in s 10 of the Mental Health Act to mean: 
     
      
       
        
        “10 A person (whether or not the person is suffering from mental illness) is a mentally disordered person if the person’s behaviour for the time being is so irrational as to justify a conclusion on reasonable grounds that temporary care, treatment or control of the person is necessary:  
         
         
          
          (a) for the person’s own protection from serious physical harm, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) for the protection of others from serious physical harm.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    120 If a person is found by the jury to be unfit to be tried, the proceedings brought against the person must not be recommenced or continued, and the court must refer the person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal: s 14(a). 
     
      
    121 The Mental Health Review Tribunal is required to determine whether on the balance of probabilities the person will, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for the offence: s 16(1). If the Tribunal makes such a determination, it must also determine whether or not the person is suffering from a mental illness: s 16(2)(a), or a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital: s 16(2)(b).  
     
      
    122 If the Tribunal determines that the person will not become fit to be tried during the succeeding 12 months, then it must notify the Attorney-General: s 16(4). Section 17 then prescribes what orders the court may make if the Tribunal determines that a person will be fit to plead within 12 months. It may, for example, grant bail for a period not exceeding 12 months: s 17(2). If the Tribunal has determined that the person is suffering from a mental illness or mental condition for which treatment is available, the court may order the person to be taken to and detained in a hospital if the person does not object, or otherwise may make an order for the detention of the person in some other place: s 17(3). 
     
      
    123 If the Mental Health Review Tribunal determines that the person will not be fit to be tried within 12 months, then the Attorney-General may direct a special hearing, or advise the Minister for Police that the person will not be further proceeded against: s 18. In a special hearing, a jury or court may deliver a verdict that the person is not guilty of the offence charged: is not guilty on the ground of mental illness; that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence; or that on the limited evidence, the accused person committed an available alternative to the offence charged: s 22(1).  
     
      
    124 Thereafter, there are procedures for dealing with a person if it is determined the person is suffering from a mental illness or mental condition. It is not necessary to expound upon the details of those provisions. They are to be found at ss 22 to 27.  
     
      
    125 It would be extraordinary if a person suffering from a purely physical condition fell within these provisions. An obvious example may be given. Assume that a person is seriously injured in an accident two days before trial and is expected in the succeeding weeks to undergo major surgery. Assume the person could not eat and was being fed and medicated intravenously. It could readily be said of such a person that that person was unfit to be tried on the date set for trial. It would be nonsense, however, to say that that person should be dealt with under the provisions of Pt 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    126 The position is different, however, if, by reason of a physical or other disability, a person was unable to understand the procedures by which he was to be tried. This is how, “unfitness to be tried” has been interpreted in a range of cases and in respect of which a range of legislation which derived originally from the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 (UK).  
     
      
    127 In R v Presser [1958] VR 45, the court was concerned with the provisions of s 426 of the Crimes Act 1928 (Vic) which provided that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if any person presented for an indictable offence is insane … and is so found by a jury lawfully empanelled for that purpose … that such person cannot be tried upon such presentment …” 
        
       
      
    128 Smith J, at 48, identified the question to be determined under the section as being: 
     
      
       
        
        “… whether the accused, because of mental defect, fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him … He needs … to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand … the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.” 
        
       
      
    129 This explanation is often referred to as the ‘Presser test’, or by a phrase such as ‘mental unfitness in the Presser sense’. 
     
      
    130 In Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 Gibbs, Mason and Wilson JJ observed that legislation governing “fitness to be tried” had always been interpreted as to raise the question “whether the prisoner has sufficient understanding to comprehend the nature of this trial, so as to make a proper defence to the charge”: see R v Pritchard (1836) 173 ER 135 per Alderson B.  
     
      
    131 Ngatayi was a “full-blood aboriginal who did not speak or understand English”. He was charged upon indictment with wilful murder. Upon his arraignment an application was made under s 631 of the Criminal Code (WA) which provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “If, when the accused person is called upon to plead to the indictment, it appears to be uncertain,  
        for any reason 
        , whether he is capable of understanding the proceedings at the trial, so as to be able to make a proper defence, a jury … [is] to be empanelled forthwith, who are to be sworn to find whether he is so capable.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    132 Their Honours, at 8, said that the test “looks to the capacity of the accused to understand the proceedings”, but pointed out that complete understanding was not necessary. Their Honours agreed with the approach taken by Smith J in Presser that the test needs to be applied “in a reasonable and commonsense fashion”. Their Honours essentially endorsed the statement of Smith J as to the minimum capacity an accused needed before he could be tried without unfairness or injustice. Their Honours noted, however, that the reference to mental capacity in Smith J’s judgment was explained by the terms of the statute under consideration by his Honour which spoke of “insanity” and not want of capacity “for any reason” which was the language of the legislation with which the Court was dealing. At 9, their Honours reiterated the test to be applied, namely, whether the accused person “is capable of understanding the proceedings at the trial so as to be able to make a proper defence”.  
     
      
    133 The High Court again dealt with the question of fitness to be tried in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230. In that case, the Court was dealing with the provisions of s 393 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). That was the same provision dealt with by Smith J in Presser. Again, the Court accepted the test to be applied was one that “looks to the capacity of the accused to understand the proceedings”. Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in their joint judgment (Dean and Dawson JJ agreeing on this point) remarked that the test did not mean that the accused was required “to have sufficient capacity to make an able defence”: see Presser at 48 and Ngatayi at 8. Their Honours then reiterated the “minimum standard” with which an accused had to comply before it could be said that the person could be tried without unfairness or injustice, as elaborated by Smith J in Presser. 
     
      
    134 In Eastman v the Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1; [2000] HCA 29 Eastman, upon an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court, raised for the first time his fitness to plead because of mental illness. In the course of considering that question, Gaudron and Hayne JJ gave consideration to what was involved in the concept of fitness to plead. Gaudron J said at [57] that in general terms, a person was fit to plead if that person “has sufficient understanding to comprehend the nature of [the trial] so as to make a proper defence to the charge”. Her Honour adopted these words from Pritchard (see above). Her Honour accepted the Presser test, that there were certain minimal matters that the accused person needed to be able to comprehend. Her Honour also accepted the qualification in Presser and Ngatayi that the person did not need to have the mental capacity to make an “able” defence.  
     
      
    135 At [59] her Honour commented that the question whether a person was fit to plead “may arise for reasons other than mental illness”. Her Honour related examples that had arisen in the cases, such as a person being deaf and dumb: see Ebatarinja v Deland (1998) 194 CLR 444; [1998] HCA 62 (also being a matter referred to in Presser); or because of language difficulties: see, for example, Ngatayi. Her Honour also noted that the concept of unfitness was one that derived from the common law, although there were usually statutory provisions which bore upon the determination of the issue. Importantly, for the issue that arises here, her Honour then said:  
     
      
       
        
        “[62] The significance of the question of a person's fitness to plead is often expressed in terms indicating that, unless a person is fit to plead, there can be no trial. Certainly, that is the position where the issue of fitness to plead is raised before or during a trial. If a person stands trial notwithstanding that there is an unresolved issue as to his or her fitness to plead, or, if that issue is not determined in the manner which the law requires, ‘no proper trial has taken place [and the] trial is a nullity.’ To put the matter another way, there is a fundamental failure in the trial process.  
         
         
        [63] The question whether there was a fundamental failure in the trial process is different from the question whether there was a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the accused lost a chance of acquittal that was fairly open. If a proceeding is fundamentally flawed because the accused was not fit to plead or if, to use the words in  
        Begum 
        , ‘the trial [is] a nullity’, the only course open to an appellate court is to set aside the verdict. And that is so regardless of the strength of the case against the accused or of the likely outcome of a further trial according to law. That is the basis upon which this Court proceeded in  
        Kesavarajah v The Queen  
        where the question of fitness to plead should have been but was not submitted to the jury for determination.” (Footnotes omitted) 
        
       
      
    136 At [66], her Honour pointed out that s 428E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act (Cth) was concerned with whether there was a question as to fitness to plead. Her Honour observed that where there was a question of fitness to plead, then that issue had to be left to the jury “unless no reasonable jury properly instructed, could find that the accused was not fit to be tried”: see Kesavarajah at 245. 
     
      
    137 In R v Sexton (2000) 116 A Crim R 173; [2000] SASC 276, Gray J (Prior and Williams JJ agreeing) observed that unfitness to be tried at common law was not limited to cases of mental illness. His Honour said at [54]: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are broader considerations, including one's inability to communicate and participate in the trial process. An inability to communicate or comprehend may be based upon physical disabilities alone, such as hearing and speech impediments. The common law does not require the presence of any psychological or intellectual impairment.” 
        
       
      
    138 The reach and operation of Pt 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act has been the subject of extensive consideration by this Court. Its statutory history and common law pre-history were considered in R v Mailes 53 (2001) NSWLR 251; [2001] NSWCCA 155.  
     
      
    139 In Mailes, Spigelman CJ, who agreed with Wood CJ at CL’s reasons, also observed at [2] that: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is not a case in which the title of the Act (with its reference to ‘mental health’) or the heading of the Part (with its reference to ‘mental disorders’) is of any assistance in the construction of the general words ‘unfitness to be tried’”. 
        
       
      
    140 Wood CJ at CL concluded at [213]-[214] that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me, in light of the legislative history, and the approach which the common law has consistently taken, concerning the fundamental right for a person placed on trial to have sufficient understanding of the proceedings so as to be able to mount a proper defence, that the Procedure Act should not be read down so as to exclude the developmentally or intellectually disabled …  
         
         
        To otherwise construe the Procedure Act would be to depart from the extended meaning given to the expression ‘mental illness’ in the context of fitness to be tried, that was developed in  
        Pritchard 
         and  
        Dashwood,  
        and 
          
        confirmed in  
        Presser, Kesavarajah 
         and  
        Eastman; 
         and potentially to negate a fundamental common law principle of fairness that has the authority of recognition over many centuries.” 
        
       
      
    141 Greg James J agreed with the reasons of Wood CJ at CL and with Spigelman CJ’s additional reasons. 
     
      
    142 In R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284; [2004] NSWCCA 7, the Court (Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sully J) held at [279] that the question of fitness to be tried was to be determined by application of the Presser test: 
     
      
       
        
        “The test for determining fitness to stand trial is whether the accused has a sufficient mental state, and intellect, to comprehend the course of the proceedings involved in the trial, so as to follow those proceedings, and so as to make a proper defence. The factors to be taken account have been accepted as being those developed in  
        R v Presser 
         (supra), an authority which has been consistently followed in this State and elsewhere: see for example  
        R v Mailes 
        ,  
        R v Zhang 
         [2000] NSWCCA 344,  
        R v  
        Tier (2001) 121 A Crim R 509, and  
        Kesavarajah v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 230.” 
        
       
      
    143 In Rivkin, the question of unfitness to be tried arose after conviction when it was established that the appellant had a brain tumour which would have caused frontal lobe dysfunction. Again, the Court referred in some detail to the authorities discussed above, which were adopted as correctly stating the law. The additional consideration in Rivkin was the test to be applied where the question of fitness to be tried is raised after conviction. That is not an issue here. However, their Honours were also considering a question that is relevant here, namely, where a person has a “temporary condition”. In that regard, their Honours said at [296]-[298]: 
     
      
       
        
        “So far as the present case involves a temporary condition, which was amenable to treatment, and which has since been reversed, so that no current question of fitness arises, it does differ from most, if not all, of the other cases which have attracted an application of the requirements in  
        R v 
          
        Presser 
        . 
         
         
        The central question which arises, in this respect, is whether a  
        reduction 
         in the capacity of an accused to meet the requirements 
          
        in 
         R v Presser 
        , but which falls short of  
        denying 
         to that accused the capacity to understand and to follow the proceedings in each of the necessary aspects, is sufficient to constitute unfitness, and to justify appellate intervention, in accordance with the test previously mentioned. 
         
         
        … The test in  
        R v 
          
        Presser 
         is directed to the minimum requirements for a fair trial. So long as the accused can understand and follow the proceedings in each of its facets, can give appropriate instructions, and can present a proper defence to the charge, he or she is to be regarded as fit to be tried. The fact that the accused may have done so in a better way, had suitable medical treatment or medication been provided, or had that accused possessed greater intelligence or acuity of mind, does not seem to us to be relevant to the question of fitness.” 
        
       
      
    144 The Court concluded at [301] that the question of fitness to be tried related to the “essential requirements” as stated in Presser. 
     
      
    145 The history of the appellant seeking to put his fitness to be tried in issue is as follows. On 8 May 2003, the appellant’s matter was listed before Blanch CJDC for “mention” (Appeal book 56). It had been adjourned from a previous date, on which occasion the appellant’s trial date of 12 May 2003 had been vacated. The purpose of setting the date for mention was in the expectation of obtaining medical reports in respect of the appellant’s medical condition. 
     
      
    146 The appellant was examined by Dr Dale Kong at the request of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions on 2 May 2003. At that examination, the appellant complained of five medical problems: hypertension; sleep apnoea; obesity; right ankle pain and left leg shortening; and multiple cutaneous lipoma.  
     
      
    147 Dr Kong considered that the appellant was “reasonably impaired by his sleep apnoea … reflected in his daytime sleepiness and poor concentration”. Dr Kong noted that the appellant was currently undergoing investigation and treatment in respect of the condition. Dr Kong concluded that the severity of the condition was such as to prevent the appellant from being able to fully concentrate over the period of the proposed trial, and concluded that he was not “medically fit” to attend such a trial, as he might “develop recurrent sleep episodes during the period of the trial”.  
     
      
    148 Dr Kong did not consider that the other medical conditions would prevent the appellant from court attendance. Having regard to the proposed treatment for the appellant’s sleep apnoea, Dr Kong expressed the opinion that he expected the appellant to be fit to attend trial six to eight weeks after commencing successful treatment. (Appeal book 58-62) 
     
      
    149 On 4 April 2003, the appellant’s matter was listed before his Honour Blanch CJDC on the appellant’s application to vacate the trial date set for 12 May 2003. The appellant supported his application with an affidavit sworn 4 April 2003. In that affidavit, he stated that he suffered from “several conditions that affect my health and impact on my capacity to stand trial on 12 May 2003”. The appellant outlined his various health problems, including sleep apnoea.  
     
      
    150 The appellant then referred to correspondence between himself and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. In that correspondence, in a letter dated 25 March 2003, he asked that his health concerns be noted and sought consent to the vacation of the trial date of 12 May 2003. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions responded, stating that it would oppose the vacation of the trial date if it was not provided with a full medical report in advance of the mention on 4 April 2003. The appellant responded by a further letter, setting out details of his health problems and agreeing to consent to the Commonwealth medical officer making material available to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.  
     
      
    151 The appellant concluded his affidavit by seeking an order vacating the trial date of 12 May 2003 “and [allowing] the matter to be mentioned again in July 2003 to consider my capacity to stand trial” (Appeal book 55).  
     
      
    152 The matter was listed before Blanch CJDC on 8 May 2003. On that occasion, the appellant informed his Honour that treatment had commenced. Accordingly, on the Crown’s application, the matter was adjourned for a further eight weeks, to enable an assessment to be made as to the appellant’s condition. The appellant agreed with that proposal (Appeal book 56). 
     
      
    153 In my opinion, the appellant’s application on 4 April 2003 did not “put in issue his fitness for trial” in the Presser sense: see appellant’s submission 1.6 (Appeal book 3). On 8 May 2003, his Honour made no finding in relation to the appellant’s fitness for trial. Rather, he acceded to an application for adjournment in circumstances where he was informed that the appellant had a medical condition in respect of which he had commenced treatment. 
     
      
    154 Accordingly, grounds 1 and 2 of the Notice of Appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    155 The appellant next complains that on 29 January 2004, Solomon DCJ erred in law and fact in not dealing with the offences pursuant to the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    156 Following the adjournment on 8 May 2003, the matter was mentioned on several occasions before Blanch CJDC, up to and including 23 January 2004. On that day, the appellant informed his Honour that his treatment had not proved successful and that he remained “unfit for trial”. The appellant said he was likely to remain unfit for the foreseeable future. His Honour indicated that he would require further medical reports and the appellant informed his Honour that he was in the process of having those prepared. The appellant said that the Court might be “aided by some submissions from counsel as to what course the matter should now take”. He said that he had had difficulty organising that over the holiday period and he was seeking another mention date. His Honour thus stood the matter over to 29 January 2004, which was the occasion on which the matter came before Solomon DCJ.  
     
      
    157 On 28 January 2004, the appellant filed a Notice of Motion, seeking directions for the further conduct of the trial. The Notice of Motion was supported by an affidavit dated 28 January 2004, in which the appellant again raised his medical conditions. He stated at para 5 of his affidavit that the matter had been adjourned by Blanch CJDC on 8 May 2003 because the appellant was “then unfit to be tried”. The appellant then stated “I remain unfit to be tried” (Appeal book 73). The appellant set out his various medical conditions. At para 21, he stated that the treatment that he had had at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital’s Sleep Disorders Clinic had been ineffective and that his symptoms persisted. He said those symptoms included frequent daytime micro sleeps that would see him “effectively black out for periods as long as 20 minutes”. The appellant concluded his affidavit seeking directions as to the future conduct of the proceedings (Appeal book 82). 
     
      
    158 The appellant made written submissions to his Honour on that occasion, in which he raised the provisions of the mental health legislation. In particular, he referred the Court to ss 8 and 10 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    159 Solomon DCJ observed that he only had one medical report on file, namely, that of Dr Kong of 2 May 2003. Accordingly, his Honour made directions relating to the obtaining of further medical evidence and allocated another mention date on 26 March 2004. The appellant agreed to that. (Appeal book 70-79) 
     
      
    160 Thereafter, there were a number of mentions of the matter. On 6 August 2004, the matter was listed before Hosking DCJ, who set the matter down for a two week trial commencing 15 November 2004.  
     
      
    161 On 5 November 2004, the matter again came before Blanch CJDC, pursuant to an application filed on 28 October 2004 and supported by an affidavit of the appellant’s solicitor, who had recently been retained. The Notice of Motion sought the vacation of the hearing date on 15 November 2004 and for the matter to be listed for mention in May or June 2005. An order was also sought that the Notice of Motion be further adjourned sine die to be brought on for hearing on seven days notice.  
     
      
    162 The Notice of Motion was supported by an affidavit of the appellant’s solicitor. In her affidavit, the solicitor recorded the history of the matter as she understood it, including that Blanch CJDC had not considered the effect of the mandatory provisions of Pt IB Div 6 of the Crimes Act (Cth) or Pt 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act when the matter was before him on 8 May 2003. The appellant’s solicitor also stated that her instructions were that Solomon DCJ also had not dealt with the application on the basis of those provisions when the matter was before him on 29 January 2004.  
     
      
    163 The solicitor stated that medical appointments had been made for the appellant commencing on 4 November 2004 and concluding on 14 March 2005. Those medical appointments related to a pre-anaesthetic appointment at St Vincent’s Hospital on 4 November 2004; surgery on 9 November 2004 by Dr Quain, Orthopaedic Surgeon; examinations on 16 November 2004 and 31 January 2005 by Dr Westmore, Psychiatrist, and Mr Borenstein, Psychologist, respectively; examination on 14 February 2005 by Dr Ong, Endocrine Specialist; surgery on 7 March 2005 by Dr Gallagher, ENT Surgeon, and a post-surgery consultation with Dr Gallagher on 14 March 2005. The appellant’s solicitor also said that she had not received the medical reports requested at that stage and, in the absence of the medical evidence and the transcript of prior proceedings to assist in the appellant’s defence, she stated that she believed the appellant was not ready to proceed to trial and, therefore, sought the orders made in the Notice of Motion. (Appeal book 135-138) 
     
      
    164 On 5 November 2004, the appellant was represented by Mr Brezniak of counsel, who submitted to his Honour that the question of fitness to stand trial had already been determined and conceded by the prosecution (Appeal book 120). He submitted that his Honour Hosking DCJ erred in setting the matter down for hearing. Mr Brezniak informed his Honour that the matter was not an application for a stay on the basis of unfitness to stand trial, although he acknowledged that that might be a “derivative application” available to the appellant. Rather, it was an application seeking to invoke the regime prescribed by the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    165 His Honour rejected the application. Unfortunately, there was a malfunction of the transcript tape, so that there is only a portion of his Honour’s reasons available for consideration. In the material that is available, his Honour stated specifically that he had not, when the matter was before him on 8 May 2003, found that “the trial should be delayed because the appellant was unfit to plead or to stand trial in the Presser sense”. His Honour then said (Appeal book 140):  
     
      
       
        
        “… the inquiry which has to be made in these cases is whether or not, in the conventional sense there is any evidence to raise the issue of fitness to plead or fitness to be tried. In support of that proposition I need to quote no more than the authority of  
        Kesavarajah 
        .” 
        
       
      
    166 His Honour also referred to the decision in Mailes. I have already dealt with that decision above. It was at that point that the tape malfunctioned.  
     
      
    167 In my opinion, a question had not arisen as to the appellant’s fitness to be tried, as that concept is properly understood, in any of the applications made prior to the date that the trial was set down for hearing on 15 November 2004. The fact that a person makes an application to the Court in which it is contended that Pt 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act applies is not necessarily sufficient for the question of a person’s fitness to be tried to arise. There has to be a question as to whether the person is able to satisfy the minimum requirements stated in Presser. Up until 15 November 2004, the only evidence before the Court on the applications made by the appellant was that of Dr Kong, who gave evidence of a medical condition from which the appellant was suffering. That evidence is set out above. There is no doubt from that evidence that the appellant had the capacity to understand each and every aspect of the Court proceedings. The only question is whether he was “able to make his defence … by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is …”. The Court, by granting an adjournment, must have accepted Dr Kong’s opinion as to the appellant’s likely inability to concentrate and the likelihood of sleep episodes during the trial. 
     
      
    168 However, that, in my opinion, gives rise, not to questions of “unfitness to be tried” but to the question whether, given a medical condition for which the appellant was then requiring treatment, it would have been fair, in the common law sense of that word, for the trial to proceed at that time. In that regard the position is no different from the man with the broken leg who was being intravenously fed or medicated.  
     
      
    169 There was no indication at that time in the medical evidence that the appellant had any cognitive impairment caused by or as a result of his sleep apnoea. Indeed, Professor Grunstein, a specialist in sleep and respiratory medicine, in his report dated 1 June 2004, said that in order to assess the appellant’s “fitness to stand trial”, his cognitive impairment would need to be assessed. In a report dated 8 July 2004, Professor Grunstein said he was of the opinion the appellant would be able to stay awake during proceedings. 
     
      
    170 Even if I am wrong in the above and a question had arisen as to the appellant’s fitness to stand trial, in the proper meaning of the phrase, as at 8 May 2003, or on 29 January 2004, the fact is, he did not stand trial. This is relevant, because the consequence of a person standing trial where a question of unfitness arises and is not dealt with is a nullity: see Eastman; Maile; Rivkin. But, as I have said, he did not stand trial at that point, so there is no question of any trial being a nullity arising. That is not to say that the appellant was without a remedy. The appellant, during the period in which the Court granted successive adjournments of both the trial and the Notices of Motion, could have sought prerogative relief. He did not do so. 
     
      
    171 As I have said, the trial was set down to commence on 15 November 2004. On that day, the appellant filed a further Notice of Motion seeking a stay of the proceedings. The Notice of Motion was supported by his affidavit of the same date, in which the appellant stated that Dr Gallagher had scheduled surgery for him in March 2005 for his sleep apnoea. The appellant stated that his sleep apnoea manifested itself in micro sleeps frequently and intermittently during the day. He said this had a debilitating effect, including lack of concentration, short periods of functioning, and vague memory. He also said his cognitive reasoning abilities were affected. The appellant said he suffered from poor memory retention and general disorientation. He also said that he experienced sleep episodes involving total paralysis. The appellant also referred to his other medical conditions.  
     
      
    172 At the commencement of proceedings on 15 November 2004, the appellant’s counsel, who was then Mr Lowe, moved on the application for a temporary stay (Appeal book 141). Counsel tendered the medical reports of Drs Kong and Grunstein to which I have already referred. In addition, he tendered reports of Dr Westmore, dated 11 November 2004, Mr Borenstein, dated 9 November 2004 and Dr Gallagher, dated 12 November 2004.  
     
      
    173 I have already referred to the opinions and conclusions of Dr Kong and Professor Grunstein. Dr Westmore reported that from a psychiatric perspective, there was nothing to indicate that the appellant was unfit to be tried. He stated that questions of the appellant’s capacity to remain alert and attentive were matters for other experts.  
     
      
    174 Mr Borenstein, on the basis of his assessment by way of interview, said that the appellant did not suffer any psychological or psychiatric disorder (Appeal book 193). He noted the appellant’s “significant history of hypertension and sleep apnoea”, and observed that during his own examination, Mr Clarkson’s concentration appeared to be intact. Mr Borenstein expressed concern that the appellant’s sleep apnoea and hypertension would interfere with his ability to maintain concentration over an extended trial. He commented, however, that he was not an expert in sleep apnoea and said that to fully appreciate the effects of this condition on the appellant’s concentration and cognitive status, more thorough neurological testing would have to be undertaken (Appeal book 194). 
     
      
    175 Dr Gallagher stated that he could see “no reason that the patient is not medically fit for trial”. He commented that it was certainly possible that a person with severe sleep apnoea could fall asleep during the day, but added: 
     
      
       
        
        “I certainly could not comment on the probability of this occurring during a trial. I am in agreement with Professor Ron Grunstein.” (Appeal book 196) 
        
       
      
    176 Dr Gallagher concluded by stating that his overall recommendation was that Mr Clarkson should undergo nasal surgery so as to optimise his nasal airways so he could use the sleep apnoea equipment appropriately. (Appeal book 196) 
     
      
    177 Hosking DCJ reviewed the appellant’s affidavit evidence and the medical evidence in detail. He also reviewed an affidavit by Ms Hayes tendered by the Crown, which set out the history of the matter.  
     
      
    178 His Honour also observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “I understand the Chief Judge’s reference [being a note on the Court file relating to the application before the Chief Judge on 5 November 2004] to the refusal of a fitness hearing to mean that his Honour did not agree that there was any reasonable evidence to suggest that the accused would be today unfit to stand his trial. It will be seen, therefore, that the matter has had a protracted history, all due to this question of the accused’s sleep apnoea and whether he will either be fit to stand his trial or can receive a trial which is not unfair.” (Appeal book 205-206) 
        
       
      
    179 His Honour then went on to review the law in respect of applications for stays. His Honour concluded by observing that, on the medical evidence, neither Professor Grunstein, nor Dr Gallagher, considered it a probability that the accused would fall asleep during trial. His Honour reiterated that it was Professor Grunstein’s opinion that the appellant should be able to maintain appropriate vigilance during court hours and the appellant’s own doctor, Dr Gallagher, did not disagree. 
     
      
    180 His Honour refused the application. 
     
      
    181 In my opinion, there was no error in his Honour so doing. The medical evidence available to the Court at that time was all to one effect, namely, that the appellant was fit to stand trial, subject possibly to a suggestion that neurological testing should be undertaken. That suggestion was made by a person not expert in the field of sleep apnoea. That is not sufficient, in the face of relevant expert evidence of fitness, in the Presser sense or under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, to raise a question of unfitness to be tried. 
     
      
    182 Before leaving this point, reference should be made to one other matter. The appellant contends that his Honour Judge Hosking also erred because he relied upon the decision of the Chief Judge in his determination on 5 November 2004, that the appellant was not unfit to be tried. I have set out the relevant passage above. In my opinion, Hosking DCJ was merely recording what had happened in the various pre-trial applications that had been made by the appellant, including that of 5 November 2004, that had been determined by the Chief Judge. In my opinion, there is nothing in his Honour’s reasons to indicate that his Honour considered that the Chief Judge’s determination on that day otherwise precluded his own consideration of the matter.  
     
      
    183 The applications before the Court on 5 and 15 November 2004 were, of course, different. The application on 15 November was for a stay. The appellant’s counsel did not raise the question of the appellant’s fitness to be tried in the Presser sense, so as to engage the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. Had it been apparent to his Honour that there was such a question, properly understood, he would have been required by the legislation to have dealt with it. However, as I have explained, the appellant’s counsel did not raise the matter, nor did that question arise out of the medical evidence that was before Hosking DCJ, except to the extent that it either refuted any question of the appellant’s unfitness (see Drs Westmore, Grunstein and Gallagher) or, alternatively, indicated that there was insufficient evidence to know whether that was the case (see Mr Borenstein), with which I have already dealt.  
     
      
    184 It follows, therefore, that grounds 7 and 8 should be rejected.  
     
      
       
      Issue 5: failure to order separate trials in respect of the s 10(1)(b) offences: Ground 9 
       
      
    185 On 15 November 2004, prior to the commencement of the trial, the appellant’s counsel made an application for a separate trial of the s 10(1)(b) offences.  
     
      
    186 Section 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (the Criminal Procedure Act) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) If of the opinion:  
         
         
          
          (a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment, 
          
         
         
          
          the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    187 Section 29 is also relevant. It provides for the circumstance where the court may hear more than one offence at the same time. It provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances:  
         
         
        … 
         
         
          
          (b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances, 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    188 The appellant did not suggest on his application at trial, or on appeal, that s 29 was not satisfied. Rather, his application was for a separate trial under s 21. 
     
      
    189 The basis upon which the appellant sought to have the s 10(1)(b) passport offences severed from the trial of the s 10(1)(a) offences and the s 184 State offences was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… different evidentiary considerations come into play in defences, between the two offence provisions and when I talk about offence provisions I’m talking false impersonation goes with 10(1)a [sic] and 10(1)b in some. The falsity that may be the subject of the Crown case for 10(1)a is not the same sort of falsity that has to be proven in my respectful submission in terms of offending conduct in 10(1)b and it would be an unfair trial. We accept false personation can be readily put there by the Crown and we don’t object to that but certainly in terms of the way that the Crown is relying upon conduct in 10(1)a to support either as tendency coincidence falsity in relation to the other remaining counts which are under s 10(1)b we say and submit there’s a certain unfairness involved in defending oneself against the whole balance of the indictment when in fact they’re talking about different offending conducts.” (Appeal book 159) 
        
       
      
    190 The Crown informed his Honour that it was relying upon coincidence evidence in respect of all offences and that a notice had been served upon the appellant of its intention to do so: see Evidence Act; s 98. The Crown then tendered a document headed “List of Coincidences”. The document set out each offence and the details relating to each. It is apparent that the document was prepared as an aide memoir to assist the Crown in the presentation of the case based upon the coincidence evidence. The document was not put before the jury, but was tendered on the application for a separate trial without objection (Appeal book 160). It is not necessary to refer to the details of the coincidence evidence. It has been referred to in part at [*] above and that is sufficient to demonstrate the nature of the coincidence evidence upon which the Crown proposed to rely (and in the event, did rely).  
     
      
    191 The trial judge rejected the appellant’s application for separate trials. He accepted the Crown’s submission that the coincidence evidence was such that it was admissible in respect of the charges under both ss 10(1)(a) and (b) respectively. His Honour referred to the decision of this Court in Verma v R (1987) 30 A Crim R 441. In that case, the Court was dealing with s 365(2) of the Crimes Act, which relevantly was in the same terms as s 21(2) set out above. Hunt J (Wood and Campbell JJ agreeing) said at 446: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is, of course, for the accused in each case to demonstrate to the trial judge that there is a risk of impermissible prejudice by reason of a joint trial which cannot sufficiently be cured by a direction to the jury. The prospect that such prejudice may arise is essentially one for the trial judge to consider upon the material which the accused chooses to put before him (and that which the Crown may add to it), and in the light of the requirements of justice in the particular case.” 
        
       
      
    192 The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in rejecting the application. He submitted that his counsel had not made a particularly articulate application for severance and proposed the submission that he said, would have more clearly demonstrated why the s 10(1)(b) offences should be separated. In this reformulated submission, he said he proposed to raise a defence to the s 10(1)(a) counts and the s 184 counts, namely, that he had committed the offences because he was in fear of his life. He said it should have been submitted to his Honour that, in order to properly advance that defence, it would be necessary for the appellant to put his criminal record in evidence and that that would be prejudicial and embarrass him in his defence on the s 10(1)(b) counts if all the matters were tried together.  
     
      
    193 The appellant also submitted that his counsel could have resisted the Crown’s argument that the charges should be heard together because of the proposed reliance upon coincidence evidence, by pointing out to his Honour that “the provisions relating to tendency and coincidence evidence do not demand a conjoined trial, they merely permit it”. He said that counsel could have informed his Honour of the appropriate test relating to coincidence evidence as formulated in R v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700; [2003] NSWCCA 319.  
     
      
    194 The use of coincidence evidence in a proceeding is governed by s 101(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “… coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    195 In Ellis, Spigelman CJ (Sully and O’Keefe JJ agreeing) stated at [99] that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the statutory formulation should operate in accordance with its terms. There is no need for an assumption that all such evidence is ‘likely to be highly prejudicial’, nor for guidance that the test for admissibility is ‘one of very considerable stringency.’” 
        
       
      
    196 Earlier, at [95], the Chief Justice stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “… section 101(2) calls for a balancing exercise which can only be conducted on the facts of each case. It requires the Court to make a judgment, rather than to exercise a discretion”.  
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Blick  
      (2000) 111 A Crim R 326; [2000] NSWCCA 61 at [20] per Sheller JA. 
       
      
    197 It must be remembered that the appellant’s application was for separate trials. There was no challenge that the evidence was not coincidence evidence. Nor was there any objection to the admissibility of the evidence based on s 101(2), although in determining whether to order a separate trial, it would be relevant, if the question was raised, to consider whether coincidence evidence upon which it was proposed to rely in a trial in respect of different charges, would have been precluded by the s 101(2) barrier.  
     
      
    198 The appellant’s counsel did not take that point on the application. Rather, his focus was on the evidence relating to the defence. But, in any event, I do not consider that the coincidence evidence would or should have been rejected under s 101(2). In the trial proper, no objection was taken to it and no appeal point has been raised in respect of it. 
     
      
    199 No other error has been demonstrated in the manner in which his Honour exercised his discretion. In the first place, the coincidence evidence upon which the Crown proposed to rely was relevant to both sets of charges sufficient to satisfy the requirements of ss 29(1)(b) and (c) of the Criminal Procedure Act.  
     
      
    200 To the extent that the appellant alleged that he was prejudiced in the charges being heard together, it was because of his proposed defence. If that was to be pressed in the terms now suggested by the appellant, his Honour would have been required to assess the availability of the defence. Presumably, that would have been done by testing the evidence intended to be adduced on a voir dire. Alternatively, sufficient details of the defence would have had to have been provided to his Honour to assess whether the defence was such that it would go to the jury and, if so, whether the appellant would be prejudiced in the charges being heard together. At trial, his Honour ruled that the evidence adduced and proposed to be adduced by the appellant was not sufficient for the defences to go to the jury. It must be inferred that the same determination would have been made on the application for separate trials. 
     
      
    201 This ground should be dismissed. 
     
      
    202 In addition to the five principal issues advanced by the appellant and the questions relating to the stated case, there were numerous other grounds of appeal in respect of which the appellant made written submissions. These should not be considered to have been abandoned, but can, in the main, be dealt with briefly.  
     
      
       
      Ground 10: the due process issue 
       
      
    203 The appellant contends that his imprisonment was unlawful, being imprisonment imposed other than pursuant to due process of law. He relies upon a range of legislation and common law principles commencing with the Magna Carta. For the most part, the submissions were discursive and not to the point.  
     
      
    204 However, in para 10.95 of his submissions, the appellant particularised six specific matters in respect of which his conviction fell short of what was required under the “due process of the law”. The first three of those issues related to his health, including the fitness for trial issues. These have already been dealt with. The fourth and fifth matters are, on his own submission, separately dealt with under grounds 14 and 12 respectively. They relate to the alleged interference by the trial judge with the orderly presentation of the case and with a general allegation that the appellant did not receive a fair trial. Those issues are dealt with below. 
     
      
    205 The sixth matter of which complaint is made was that the appellant was denied procedural fairness, in that the trial judge made findings adverse to the interests of the appellant, without receiving and considering evidence in relation to the appellant’s past, including his trial for murder in 1980; his 10-year period of imprisonment; the disappearance of Chris Flannery; the murder of named underworld figures and alleged attempts on his own life more than a decade ago. These matters were also subject of a separate ground of appeal, ground 13, and have been dealt with. This ground should be rejected.  
     
      
      Ground 12: fair trial 
       
      
    206 The appellant contends in this ground that he did not receive a fair trial. Many of the submissions directed to this ground relate to other grounds of the appeal, including grounds 7, 8 and 14, the appellant’s contention being that he should not have been forced to trial at a time when his health was such that he was unable to give evidence effectively or be cross-examined. This has already been dealt with. 
     
      
    207 An allegation of bias appears to be raised in para 12.19 of the appellant’s submissions. The appellant contends that from 6 August 2004, when his Honour the trial judge first had conduct of the matter, his Honour “appeared to approach the appellant with a preconceived stance, a fixed opinion and a mindset adverse to the appellant”. The appellant did not provide any reference to the transcript to support this allegation. In my opinion, this submission, to be made out, would need such references or, alternatively, would need evidence from either the appellant himself, his counsel, or his solicitor. None has been forthcoming. For that reason alone this should be rejected. There are two other reasons this ground of appeal should be rejected. First, a reading of the transcript does not support the allegation. Whilst the transcript does reveal that there were occasions when it was apparent that his Honour was keen for the trial process to be “kept going” and on occasions it appears from a reading of the transcript, his Honour expressed some frustration at counsel’s submissions, that is a long way from providing material that would indicate that the appellant did not receive a fair trial. I would only add that to the extent that a similar issue is raised in ground 14, where transcript references are provided, the issue as framed under that ground will be given consideration there. 
     
      
    208 The appellant also contends that from time to time he fell asleep during the trial. He contends that this interfered with a fair trial in a number of respects. First, he says that, having given written instructions to his counsel to make an application for a separate trial of the s 10(1)(b) offences (see appeal ground 9), the appellant says that it is apparent that he then fell asleep and did not hear the terms in which the application was made. The appellant says that the transcript shows that after the application was made, his counsel asked the trial judge for an opportunity to get further instructions (he says that his counsel woke him and informed him the application had been made whilst he was asleep) and counsel then told the trial judge he didn’t want to be heard further on the matter. This is supposition. The transcript reveals that after the Crown made its submissions on the application, his Honour asked Mr Lowe whether he wanted to say anything further. Mr Lowe responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yes, I just need to obtain some instructions if your Honour pleases. I don’t wish to be heard any further …” 
        
       
      
    209 There is no indication in the transcript as to whether Mr Lowe spoke to his solicitor or spoke to the appellant. There is no indication as to whether the appellant was asleep. Rather, the transcript of Mr Lowe’s submissions to the judge are recorded as I have put them. If the appellant wished to contend that he was asleep during this period, evidence would be necessary to establish that was the case. There is none.  
     
      
    210 The appellant also submits that he was asleep during the Crown address. Mr Lowe raised this with his Honour at the conclusion of the Crown address, and indicated that he just wished to make that statement for the record. However, there is and was no evidence as to the period that the appellant was asleep, or whether counsel otherwise found himself unable to get instructions.  
     
      
    211 The Court has no sense whether the appellant had micro sleeps of a minute more or less or longer sleeps. In the absence of evidence of these matters, it has not been demonstrated that the trial, for this reason, was not fair. 
     
      
    212 The appellant raises other occasions when he was asleep during the trial. On the afternoon of 17 November 2004, counsel informed his Honour that he had noticed on six separate occasions his client had his eyes closed. Counsel said that his instructions were that at that stage of the afternoon it was very difficult for his client and he asked for a short break. The Crown did not object, commenting “I think it’s probably difficult for everyone really”. His Honour responded by saying the case was “a bit intrinsically soporific anyway” and that he had observed the jury exhibiting signs of tiredness during the afternoon, during the presentation of what had been a largely documentary case. However, his Honour had already indicated that he was proposing to adjourn at that point and informed counsel that thereafter the Court would have a break for five minutes at about 3pm each afternoon (Appeal book 401).  
     
      
    213 The appellant said that there were occasions when he was asleep not only on that day, but on the previous day, the second day of the trial, and the fourth day. It is not apparent from the record how long the appellant was asleep, although on each occasion when the matter was drawn to his Honour’s attention, he responded by providing an adjournment. Counsel did not submit to his Honour on these occasions that he was unable to obtain instructions. Rather, on the only day in which he raised the matter of instructions, he did so in terms that he had turned around on two occasions to obtain instructions and his client had been asleep. However, counsel did not complain that he was then unable to get instructions. 
     
      
    214 The appellant further complains that even though the trial judge had informed the jury of the appellant’s sleep apnoea and the need for a break every hour or so, his Honour refused to give the appellant a break immediately before his cross-examination commenced (submission 12.08). This is correct, but it must be put in context. It is apparent that the examination in chief finished late in the afternoon. At the end of the examination, appellant’s counsel stated “I might … put on the record, that I think it’s advisable that a five minute break occur at this stage, but I’m in your Honour’s hands.” 
     
      
    215 His Honour responded saying they had had a break at a quarter to four and that the appellant looked reasonably alert, and had been answering the questions in an alert way. Cross-examination then commenced. Nothing was raised thereafter that the appellant was having difficulty staying awake. In my opinion, the transcript does not reveal that the continuation of the trial in the circumstances was such that the appellant did not have a fair trial. It does appear that he nodded off from time to time. As his Honour observed, that is not unusual in a courtroom, in any event, particularly when a matter proceeds on largely documentary evidence. The appellant’s counsel did not complain to his Honour that he was unable to get instructions at any time in respect of any relevant issue. In my opinion, the transcript does not disclose that the trial was not fair. Further, if it was the appellant’s case that he had been asleep with any degree of frequency, or that for any period of time he had not understood what was going on, so as to be in a position to give instructions, then evidence of this should have been adduced, either by himself and/or his legal representatives. In the absence of evidence and in circumstances where it is not apparent from the transcript that the trial was not fair, the appellant has failed to make out this ground of appeal and it should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 14: trial judge’s interference with the orderly presentation of the case  
       
      
    216 The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in interfering with the orderly presentation of the case for the Crown; in the presence of the jury, his Honour treated any point favourable to the Crown “with benevolence and approval” and, contrastingly, dismissing any applications by the appellant “with derision and scorn” and/or belittling and attacking defence counsel, all in the presence of the jury. The appellant further alleged that the trial judge suborned the role of the jury as the sole arbiter of issues of fact. 
     
      
    217 I have read the instances relied upon by the appellant in paras 14.1 and 14.2 of his submissions, in which it is contended that the trial judge interfered in the manner in which the Crown was conducting its case. With respect, this submission is not made out. These instances indicate occasions when the trial judge himself asked questions of the witness or was otherwise regulating the procedures in his Court. 
     
      
    218 The next point, that the trial judge treated any point favourable to the Crown with benevolence and approval, is also rejected. An examination of a selection of the passages relied upon by the appellant reveal that his Honour did no more than properly regulate the Court for the purposes of the trial. I do not propose to set out any of the passages referred to, other than to state, in general terms, that his Honour at various times explained what an exhibit was at the time it was tendered, or himself sought to clarify a particular answer from a witness. 
     
      
    219 The next allegation relates to the manner in which his Honour treated defence counsel. The allegation is that his Honour belittled and attacked defence counsel in the presence of the jury. An examination of the transcript again reveals that this allegation is not made out. An example might be taken from the first of the transcript passages upon which the appellant relies:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. She indicated that she had applied for a passport during that record of conversation -- 
         
         
        Crown Prosecutor: Your Honour -- 
         
         
        Witness: With respect sir if I could -- 
         
         
        Crown Prosecutor: Just stop. I object to this question. 
         
         
        His Honour: Yes. Unless you can demonstrate how this evidence is properly admissible Mr Lowe, I reject it. 
         
         
        Lowe: Yes. I know it’s a little bit early -- 
         
         
        His Honour: It’s a third party assertion made by a person not in court which can’t be tested. I don’t see for myself how it is admissible. 
         
         
        Lowe: Well it is relevant to – it’s an issue that really should be explored in the absence of the jury. 
         
         
        His Honour: I don’t know about that. Can you tell me in one or two sentences how you say it’s admissible? It might be relevant, it doesn’t mean it’s admissible. It transgresses Mr Lowe, does it not, to hearsay? 
         
         
        Lowe: I accept what your Honour says. I might return to it at an appropriate stage if it’s convenient to your Honour. 
         
         
        His Honour: All right.” (Tr 18 November 2004, p167 lines 1-31) (Appeal book 413) 
        
       
      
    220 The next passage relied upon by the appellant was not in the presence of the jury. There was nothing in that portion of the transcript which would indicate any inappropriate or belittling comment by his Honour.  
     
      
    221 In the next passage relied upon (18 November 2004, p 184 lines 50-56) his Honour made two comments to the appellant’s counsel in the presence of the jury after an objection taken by the Crown Prosecutor to a question asked. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t quite understand the latter part of that question Mr Lowe in relation to the address.” 
        
       
       
      Mr Lowe responded with what appears to be a question. His Honour then said, “ 
      I reject it in that form. I understand the e-mail address part 
      ”. That does not fit the description of “ 
      belittling or attacking defence counsel 
      ”.  
       
      
    222 In the next section of transcript, on the same day, at pp 187-189, his Honour again was responding to an objection taken by the Crown Prosecutor. On this occasion, his Honour said to Mr Lowe, “[y]ou can’t win on this basis Mr Lowe”. That may have been a non-legalistic way of indicating to counsel that these questions were irrelevant. I do not see, however, that comment would so taint the trial that it became unfair. The appellant asked some further questions of the witness and again the Crown interrupted with what appears to be the commencement of an objection. His Honour interposed with the comment, “[t]oo broad Mr Lowe”. Mr Lowe responded, “I accept that your Honour”. The appellant’s counsel asked a further question and his Honour rejected it without any objection being taken, on the basis that it still remained too broad and his Honour thought that whatever the answer that might be given to the question, it would be worthless to the jury. His Honour was engaging in appropriate judicial conduct in ensuring that relevant questions were asked. 
     
      
    223 Another example relied upon was, on 24 November 2004, at Tr 401 (Appeal book 661), where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m against you Mr Lowe, I adhere to my earlier ruling. In my view the evidence that you seek to adduce about the later deaths of these people in Victoria is irrelevant.” 
        
       
       
      Mr Lowe then made a further submission on the same point, to which his Honour responded: 
       
       
        
        “I’m against you Mr Lowe as I have said twice. Are there any other questions that you want to ask of Mr Clarkson?” 
        
       
       
      His Honour’s firmness as it appears from the transcript could not be said to be belittling counsel.  
       
      
    224 I do not propose to continue to analyse the passages relied upon. The matters that I have referred to indicate that there was nothing untoward in the manner in which his Honour conducted the trial. 
     
      
    225 The appellant next contended that his Honour forced his counsel to make submissions on points of law in the presence of the jury and then dismissed some ex tempore with derision and scorn. He relies, amongst other passages, on his Honour’s rejection of events that happened after the commission of the offences as being relevant to the appellant’s state of mind. Again, one example will demonstrate the types of exchange that occurred between the trial judge and the appellant. On 24 November 2004 at Tr 382 (Appeal book 642), his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour: Q. How can things that have happened after be relevant to your client’s state of mind at the time he’s alleged to have made these false applications. 
         
         
        Lowe: There is authority for that. 
         
         
        His Honour: What is it, it doesn’t seem logical to me. I reject it Mr Lowe.” 
        
       
      
    226 I do not consider this is a comment of “derision or scorn”.  
     
      
    227 An examination of his Honour’s questioning during the course of the appellant’s evidence likewise reveals that his Honour did not inappropriately enter the fray in a manner which would prejudice the conduct of the appellant’s defence. For example on 24 November 2004 at Tr 374 (Appeal book 634), the appellant had given an answer in relation to his associations with underworld figures as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Bobby Dix was an old style painter and docker. I knew him from A Division when I was in gaol. I was surprised he was involved in the attempt on me but then again I guess nothing really surprises me.  
         
         
        His Honour: Q. What was the last part, nothing would surprise you? 
         
        A. Nothing really surprises me but I wouldn’t have thought he would have been involved in an attempt on me but there we are.” 
        
       
       
      Counsel then continued the questioning. His Honour then sought some clarification about the answer in relation to Bobby Dix. His Honour asked: 
       
       
        
        “… you say that you were surprised at an attempt on you by Bobby Dix … [a]n attempt to do what?” 
         
        
       
      The appellant replied that he was talking about an attempt on his life.  
       
      
    228 Another example, on the next day of trial, also indicates that his Honour’s questions and/or directions were not inappropriate. The appellant was being cross-examined on the passport and driver licence applications in the name of Barton and a drivers licence in the name of Papps. The appellant was asked by the Crown Prosecutor: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you knew you weren’t entitled to get a licence in the name of Jason Papps, given that you had all of these other licences, didn’t you? 
         
        A. Well, that’s a complex matter of law.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour then intervened: 
       
       
        
        “No, no, it’s not a complex matter of law Mr Clarkson, just answer that question will you?” (Tr 25 November 2004, p 439) (Appeal book 699) 
        
       
       
      Again, his Honour was doing no more than ensuring that a witness was kept to the point. He was entitled to do so. 
       
      
    229 The next significant allegation is that his Honour was biased, because he had granted leave to a journalist to have access to the Court exhibits, without reference to either the Crown or the defence. This allegation was put on the basis that “the learned trial judge gave the impression that he had covertly given the exhibits to the reporter”. The appellant submitted that the application by the journalist to have access to the exhibits was not heard in open court, “but appeared to be a private adventure alone of Hosking DCJ” such that it raised a reasonable apprehension of bias. 
     
      
    230 On 22 November 2004, in the absence of the jury, counsel raised with his Honour the appellant’s concern as to how the photographs on the various applications came to be in the Sydney Morning Herald. His Honour informed the appellant that he had granted leave for the journalist to have copies of the exhibits on the basis that they had been documents tendered publicly, in a public hearing, and his Honour saw no reason to deny access to them. His Honour said, in his understanding, that was commonly done. Mr Lowe responded, “I’m just making sure the due process is followed, your Honour”.  
     
      
    231 His Honour responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Due process was followed, they made an approach through my associate, there’s been a reporter here for most of the trial as I understand it.” (Tr 22 November 2004 p 299)  
        
       
       
      It was not suggested that this was not a usual practice of the Court. In my opinion, nothing has been demonstrated that indicates his Honour followed a wrong or inappropriate process.  
       
       
      Ground 15: the “five year old child rule” 
       
      
    232 The appellant contends that his Honour erred in law and fact in formulating and then applying as a threshold test a “five year old child rule” in finding that the defences raised by the appellant could only be considered by the jury if the trial judge was satisfied that a five year old child could see there was a defence and in finding, without receiving and considering evidence of the facts, that that defence was available as a matter of law. 
     
      
    233 Towards the conclusion of the submissions relating to the availability of the defences, his Honour requested counsel to provide him with submissions that indicated that the view he had taken earlier as to the application of the law of duress in circumstances such as this did not represent the law. At this point, the appellant’s counsel was referring to the case of Loughnan. His Honour then referred to Rogers, at which point the appellant’s counsel submitted to his Honour that it was a “jury question”. His Honour rejected that submission, stating that the evidence was not capable of establishing the defence. After a further submission, his Honour stated to the appellant’s counsel that he was not going to allow the evidence to go to the jury. There was this exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lowe: I hear what your Honour says and I would ask that I now be able to obtain instructions about releasing this particular witness [DSS Swindells] now that your Honour has indicated that you would be taking all those defences away from the jury. 
         
         
        His Honour: Yes, unless the evidence is going to be different Mr Lowe. Unless the evidence is going to rise above the evidence that I have before me at the moment because I can tell you Mr Lowe that the criminal law is not a joke and I am not going to allow it to be used for a purpose which will make the criminal law look ludicrous in the eyes of the jury in asking them to consider defences which an intelligent five year old would think were laughable. How long do you want?” (Appeal book 686-687) 
        
       
      
    234 The appellant’s elevation of this comment to being the basis of a legal principle which his Honour applied, with respect, raises a non-issue, and ought to be dismissed. The other submissions advanced by the appellant in respect of this ground have been considered in relation to issue 3.  
     
      
       
      Ground 24: prohibiting the appellant from referring to his notes while giving evidence and being cross-examined 
       
      
    235 At the beginning of the appellant’s examination, when being asked introductory questions as to his name, date of birth, schooling and other educational and professional background details, the appellant asked whether he could refer to his notes. The Crown stated that at that stage, there was no particular objection (Appeal book 583).  
     
      
    236 At a much later time in his examination, when the appellant was giving evidence of his association with different persons, the Crown objected to his using notes. No objection was taken by counsel at that point. Indeed, counsel indicated to the Court that the examination in this area would not go on much longer. The appellant contends that his evidence then deteriorated, became confused, vague and unresponsive. A reading of the transcript does not support the submission, except to the extent that when asked about when a particular attempt on his life was made, the appellant responded by saying that he did not have his notes. When asked when, roughly, it was, he responded “Roughly 93-94 and I think [another person named] died in 97”.  
     
      
    237 It is not usual to allow a person to refer to notes in the course of giving evidence. No objection was made and, as I have stated, the appellant’s evidence remained cogent even though there were some matters about which he did not have specific recall, but those matters were not of any critical importance in his defence. I would reject this ground.  
     
      
       
      Ground 25: diminished responsibility 
       
      
    238 The appellant contends that the jury should have been directed that the appellant’s conduct was severely affected by his mental condition, which substantially impaired his capacity to understand events and control his actions. As I understand this ground, the diminished responsibility related both to the appellant’s alleged mental condition that he attempted to raise by way of a defence, in that he was under such duress that he had a defence to the s 10(1)(a) and s 184 offences and also to his other health conditions which were the subject of his applications that he was unfit to be tried. Diminished responsibility is a defence that relates to homicide offences only. This ground of appeal is irrelevant and is dismissed. I have otherwise dealt with the allegations that relate to his allegations of unfitness to plead and the defences.  
     
      
       
      Ground 30: jury of 12 
       
      
    239 The appellant contends that as a matter of law he was entitled to a jury of 12 persons to hear and determine the Commonwealth appeal.  
     
      
    240 During the course of the appeal a juror became ill and was discharged and the trial continued with 11 jurors. In this regard, s 22 of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) (the Jury Act) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “22 Continuation of trial or inquest on death or discharge of juror 
         
         
        Where in the course of any trial or coronial inquest any member of the jury dies or is discharged by the court or coroner whether as being through illness incapable of continuing to act or for any other reason, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial or inquest properly constituted if:  
         
         
          
          (a) in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members:  
          
         
         
          
          (i) is not reduced below 10, 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (ii) is reduced below 10 but approval in writing is given to the reduced number of jurors by or on behalf of both the person prosecuting for the Crown and the accused or each of the accused, or 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (iii) is reduced below 10 but not below 8 and the trial has been in progress for at least 2 months, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (b) in the case of civil proceedings, the number of its members is not reduced, in the case of a jury of 4, below 3 or, in the case of a jury of 12, below 8, or 
          
         
         
          
          (c) in the case of a coronial inquest, the number of its members is not reduced below 4, 
          
         
         
        and if the court or the coroner, as the case may be, so orders.” 
        
       
      
    241 The appellant contends that Commonwealth law demands that the trial of Federal offences be by a jury of 12. Whilst acknowledging that s 68 of the Judiciary Act provides that the practice and procedure of the State where a person is tried are to apply, he says that generally, Commonwealth law is not overridden: see the Constitution s 80. It followed, on his argument, that a provision such as s 22 of the Jury Act did not override the provisions of the Constitution. Section 80 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes.” 
        
       
      
    242 The question whether a trial which continued with 10 jurors after the exercise of the discretion otherwise conferred by s 22 contravened the Constitutional safeguard of trial by jury provided for in s 80 was considered by the High Court in Brownlee v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 278; [2001] HCA 36. Gleeson CJ and McHugh J held at [23]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Neither history, nor principle, nor authority warrants a conclusion that the meaning of “trial … by jury” in s 80 of the Constitution is inconsistent with the provisions of s 22(a)(i) of the  
        Jury Act 
        .” 
        
       
       
      See also Gaudron, Gummow & Hayne JJ at [71]-[73]. 
       
      
    243 It follows that this argument should be rejected. 
     
      
    244 Finally, the appellant contends his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion under s 22. No error has been demonstrated. The trial was well advanced by that stage. There was no error in taking into account the fact that the charges were “old”. Indeed, that was a relevant consideration in having the trial continue with 11 jurors.  
     
      
    245 It follows that ground 30 should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion on the appeal against conviction 
       
      
    246 It follows from the above that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.  
     
      
    247 I have had the opportunity to read in draft the reasons of Howie J relating to the application for leave to appeal against sentence. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and proposed orders. 
     
      
       
      Application for stated case 
       
      
    248 As indicated above, there are related proceedings in the Court of Appeal proceedings CA 40803/06 including a stated case. Associated with the stated case was a question relating to a stated case in respect of the s 184 charges. According to correspondence between the appellant and the Commonwealth DPP, the appellant proposed to add a ninth question to the case to be stated case relating to the charges under s 184 of the Crimes Act. The terms of the proposed question were: 
     
      
       
        
        “Did I err in law in not finding that there was no case to answer in relation to the False Personation Counts in the Indictment preferred pursuant to section 184, 
         Of the Crimes Act 
         1900 (NSW) and in not directing the jury to acquit the appellant on these counts on the defence application made at the end of the Crown case.” 
        
       
      
    249 Section 5A of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that a judge before whom a person is tried and convicted on indictment may submit a question of law relating to the trial or conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination. Any question so submitted is to be dealt with as if it were an appeal under s 5. 
     
      
    250 This question was not submitted to the Court in the case stated by his Honour. It is not clear whether this was by oversight, but in any event, this question was raised in precisely the same terms as ground 26 on the appeal and has been dealt with on that basis.  
     
      
    251 Having regard to my conclusions in respect of the grounds of appeal and my agreement with Howie J in respect of the application for leave to appeal against sentence, the orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Application for leave to appeal against sentence allowed but appeal against sentence dismissed.  
        
       
      
    252 SULLY J: I agree with Beazley JA and with Howie J. 
     
      
    253 HOWIE J: I have the benefit of reading the judgment of Beazley JA in draft and agree for the reasons given by her Honour that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    254 The appellant was convicted of five offences contrary to s 10(1)(a) and seven offences contrary to s 10(1)(b) of the Passports Act (Cth) and four offences contrary to s 184 of the Crimes Act (NSW). Judge Hosking sentenced the appellant to a total term of imprisonment of 2 years and 4 months. In effect he was sentenced for the Commonwealth offences to 19 months and for the State offences to a cumulative 9 months. The Judge did not impose a non-parole period or a recognisance release order. 
     
      
    255 The maximum penalty for the offences in contravention of the Passports Act was relevantly imprisonment for 2 years and for the offences against s184 imprisonment for 7 years. 
     
      
    256 The appellant was born in 1950. He had convictions in Victoria for offences of dishonesty in 1985 and again in 1987 for which he received a gaol sentence involving a minimum period in custody of 8 years. A pre-sentence report revealed that the appellant was released to parole in Victoria in 1991 and completed the parole period in 1995. The Judge took into account that there was some question unresolved about some of the Victorian convictions and that there might be an inquiry regarding them. 
     
      
    257 The appellant had come to Australia from New Zealand in 1973 on the break up of his first marriage. He remarried but that ended in divorce in 1980 without children. He is a lawyer and worked initially with the Bank of New Zealand. He hopes to complete a master’s degree in law. He was on a disability pension as a result of health problems including sleep apnoea and hypertension. 
     
      
    258 He told the officer preparing the report that he felt justified in committing the offences as without having done so he would be dead. He was described as an intelligent person who had used his abilities for illegal purposes. He was assessed as not benefiting from supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. He had been in custody prior to being sentenced since he was convicted on 26 November 2004. 
     
      
    259 He was sentenced on 11 April 2005. The Judge found that helping persons to obtain passports had the potential to assist them in committing other offences. He described the offences as involving a scheme of “some sophistication and involved elaborate planning”. The Judge found that the passport offences stood towards the upper range of the seriousness of such offences and the licence offences of “slightly lesser seriousness”. He held the general deterrence should be reflected in the sentence as well as specific deterrence in light of the absence of any remorse shown by the appellant for his offending. 
     
      
    260 The appellant has raised a number of grounds of appeal in relation to the sentences imposed. He has filed lengthy written submissions in relation to each ground of appeal and did not speak to them orally at the hearing. The first of the grounds relating to sentence, Ground 31, asserts that the sentence is manifestly excessive. The appellant’s written submissions in support of this ground contains a completely unfounded assertion that the Judge found the task of sentencing the appellant more pleasant than he should have done. This allegation is based largely upon the appellant’s complaints of bias on the part of the Judge during the trial, an allegation that Beazley JA has rejected. 
     
      
    261 It is also submitted that the Judge sentenced the appellant more harshly by reason of the lies that he believed the appellant had told in explanation for the offences. There is nothing to suggest that he did punish the appellant in this way. The Judge was fully entitled, in my view, to indicate that the appellant’s explanation for the offending was “bordering on the farcical”. The fact that the Judge may have disbelieved the appellant’s version of events meant that there was no remorse for his offending and might also have raised doubts about the appellant’s rehabilitation. To that extent the appellant’s lack of honesty in his evidence could have legitimately resulted in a longer sentence than might otherwise have been the case. 
     
      
    262 It was also submitted that the Judge failed to follow Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 and Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 but I can see nothing that indicates that the Judge wrongly determined the individual sentences or the manner in which they should be accumulated to give the overall sentence. The appellant seems to believe that it is significant that the Judge was Senior Counsel before the High Court in Pearce. Even if that were so, I do not see that it has the slightest relevance to any of the grounds of appeal or the correctness or otherwise of the sentences imposed upon the appellant. 
     
      
    263 The appellant set out a table purporting to show that, after taking into account remissions and a discount of a third for the fact that he was serving his sentence under a more strict custodial regime, the sentence imposed would have been the equivalent of a head term of 7 years. In my view these calculations are misguided because there is no discount for remissions applicable and no set discount to be applied according to the nature of the custody being served. 
     
      
    264 Ground 32 complains that the Judge erred in not imposing wholly concurrent sentences because the offences fell within what the appellant described as “one multi-faceted course of conduct”. It has been held repeatedly in this Court that a sentencing judge has a discretion whether to order that sentences for multiple offences be concurrent or cumulative. Generally, however, the overall sentence must reflect the overall criminality reflected in the offences for which sentence is being imposed and the issue of totality of criminality will determine how the sentences are to be structured. It has been made clear that concurrent sentences are not required simply because the offences form part of a single act of criminality or arise from a single course of criminal conduct. Here there were separate acts of dishonesty in relation to each of the offences and in my opinion there was no error in the decision of the Judge to cumulate some of the sentences. This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    265 Ground 33 complains that the Judge did not take into account that the sentences were to be served in this State where there are no remissions available. Section 16G of the Crimes Act (Cth) use to require that a court sentencing for Commonwealth offences take into account the absence of remissions in the jurisdiction where the sentence was to be served. The result was that in this State sentences for Commonwealth offences were usually reduced by about one third to compensate for the absence of remissions. The appellant claims that he should have received that discount. However s 16G was repealed and ceased to operate from 16 January 2003. The effect of the repeal of that provision was considered in a number of decisions of this Court starting with R v Studenikin (2004) 60 NSWLR 1 through to R v Bezan (2004) 147 A Crim R 430. In effect those decisions hold that there is no longer any reduction of sentences because of the absence of remissions but that sentences to be imposed after the repeal of s 16G were not to increase automatically by a third. In the present case there was no reason for the Judge to take any different approach in sentencing the appellant simply because the offences occurred before the section was repealed. The ground must be rejected. 
     
      
    266 Ground 34 is to the effect that the Judge erred in failing to take into account the period of time that had elapsed since the offences were committed. The appellant refers to the well-known principle set out in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 about the relevance of delay in sentencing. However I do not believe that the offences should be treated as “stale crimes” as that expression is used in Todd. Much of the delay was no doubt due to the fact that the appellant was pleading not guilty and some of it as a result of the appellant seeking adjournments on medical grounds. Although the appellant was not to be punished for causing any delay, there was no reason why it should have resulted in any great leniency. The appellant was on bail throughout the period before he was convicted, but the conditions of his bail were not so rigorous that any account should have been taken of them. There was no material to suggest that the appellant had been prejudiced in any way by the delay nor was there anything to suggest that the delay had any other impact upon the sentences to be imposed for the offences. The effect of any rehabilitation that the appellant might have achieved in that time was diminished substantially by his lack of remorse for the offences and his belief in his justification for his conduct. The ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    267 Ground 35 complains that the Judge did not take into account sufficiently the appellant’s health problems at the time of the commission of the offences. The Judge indicated explicitly that he did take that matter into account but the appellant submits that his Honour should be seen as being “disingenuous” in stating that he did so. It was suggested that the Judge’s statements and conduct throughout the trial indicated that he did not believe that the applicant was seriously affected by health disorders. I do not believe that there is any basis for this criticism and I do not see why the Judge should not be taken at his word. 
     
      
    268 In any event the commission of the offences were unconnected to his health problems and his ill health did not explain or mitigate the criminality involved in the offences. There was no evidence that the health of the applicant was a matter that would result in imprisonment being significantly harsher for him. In any event there is little mitigation to be found in poor health that existed at the time of the commission of offences. It has frequently been stated that ill health is not a licence to commit crime. Contrary to the appellant’s submissions there was no reason to diminish the impact of deterrence by reason of the applicant’s health problems. The ground has no substance. 
     
      
    269 Ground 36 complain that the Judge did not order that part of the sentence be served by some means other than full-time custody, such as periodic detention or parole. It was submitted that the Judge failed to fix a period of parole because he found it too difficult to do so. This impertinent submission overlooks the fact that it is not unusual for Judges of the District Court to impose sentences for both Commonwealth and State offences on the one offender and appear to be able to do so with little difficulty in understanding and applying the different provisions. The Judge determined that the minimum time in custody that the appellant should serve for these offences was the sentence imposed. He gave as a reason for not fixing a parole period or a release order the manner in which he was structuring the sentences that is by a series of short overlapping sentences. It can be assumed that the Judge saw no purpose in requiring the appellant to serve a period on parole or under a recognisance. In light of the appellant’s age, criminal record and the lack of any perceived benefit to be received from supervision, the Judge was entitled to impose what was in effect a fixed term of imprisonment. In my view it was an entirely appropriate method of dealing with the appellant. If this Court were to intervene to specify a period on parole, it could only do so by increasing the overall sentence to be served by the appellant, a course that this Court would not adopt on an appellant’s appeal. The ground fails. 
     
      
    270 Ground 37 raises an error by the Judge in referring to the fact that the appellant was to be sentenced for seven offences under s 10(1)(a) of the Passports Act when there were only five offences under that section. It is clear that this was a mere slip on the part of the sentencing judge who was aware that there were twelve offences under that Act. The offences each carried the same maximum penalty regardless of the section breached. The error could not in my view have resulted in a harsher sentence than would have been appropriate for the offences of which the appellant was convicted particularly having regard to the manner in which the Judge sentenced the respondent, each of the sentences for the passport offences being identical. This ground fails. 
     
      
    271 Ground 38 complains that the Judge sentenced the appellant on the basis the he was “a very dishonest man” because of the sentences imposed in 1985. As has been noted the appellant was sentenced to a total minimum of 8 years imprisonment in Victoria for offences of dishonesty. The offences before his Honour were also dishonest offences involving as they did false statements and misrepresentations of facts. The appellant complains that the criminal record placed before his Honour erroneously showed that he had a conviction for perjury that he denies. He states that he instructed his legal representative that this was so but no point was taken at the hearing. In light of the other offences for which he was convicted and sentenced in 1985, the additional perjury conviction, even if it were an error, would not have made the slightest difference to an assessment of the appellant as a dishonest person. The Judge was clearly entitled to take into account the appellant’s criminal record. In my opinion there was no miscarriage of justice arising from his criminal record or the Judge’s comments upon it. This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    272 Ground 39 complains that the Judge erred in remarking that only one of the appellant’s passports had been detected when a number had been recovered. This was hardly a matter of such moment that, had the Judge been in error, it would have resulted in this Court holding that his discretion had so miscarried as to warrant this Court’s intervention. But in any case the evidence was that only one passport had been recovered, that for Virginia Yan. 
     
      
    273 Ground 40 concerns the fact that the appellant had served his period in custody prior to sentencing as a “SMAP inmate”. It was submitted that the Judge should have taken into account that he had served a period of custody under harsher conditions and also that he may be required to serve the balance of his sentence under such conditions in the future. It has been noted by this Court that, just because a person is serving a sentence in some form of protective custody, it does not necessarily follow that those conditions would be harsher than the conditions for prisoners in the normal prison population: R v Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304. This Court has emphasised that, if an offender wishes to receive some mitigation of sentence by reason of the conditions of imprisonment, it is for the offender to lead evidence of what those conditions entail. There was no evidence before the sentencing Judge of the conditions of the appellant’s imprisonment and none before this Court. There is merely a bald assertion that the conditions of his imprisonment were more onerous. The appellant does point to the fact that his legal representative was intending to obtain a letter from the gaol authorities as to the conditions of the appellant’s imprisonment but that was not forthcoming by the time he was sentenced. Contrary to the appellant’s assertion, there was no requirement for the Judge to postpone passing sentence until that information was placed before him. In any event there is no material before this Court to justify any reduction in the sentences and this ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    274 Ground 41 asserts that the Judge erred in not finding that the appellant had good prospects of rehabilitation. This was a question of fact for his Honour to determine on the material before him. The Judge was aware and expressly mentioned the fact that the appellant was undertaking further studies and hoped to obtain a Master’s degree. Other than that there was little evidence to support a positive finding that the appellant had good prospects of rehabilitation. The appellant in his submissions relies upon his progress in dealing with his health issues, but that does not seem to me to advance the matter. There was, however, evidence against the appellant’s rehabilitation and that was his attitude to his offending. I would not be prepared to find that he had good prospects of rehabilitation if it were necessary for this Court to resentence him. At best the evidence is neutral: at worst his sense of justification for what he did suggests that the appellant will take any action that he thinks is necessary even if it means planning and committing criminal offences. 
     
      
    275 Grounds 42 to 46 relate to an assertion by the appellant that the Judge in effect refused to allow the appellant to give or call evidence at the sentencing proceedings. The appellant asserts that he wished to give and call evidence as to the background to the offending including the defences raised during the trial. He also asserts that he wished to call witnesses to give evidence as to the appellant’s character and lifestyle and the effect on him of the period he served in custody in Victoria.  
     
      
    276 Notwithstanding that the Judge had refused to permit the accused to rely upon self-defence, duress, or necessity during the trial, both defence counsel and the Judge accepted that evidence of those matters could be relevant to the sentences to be imposed. The difficulty for the appellant was that the Judge did not accept his explanation. On 1 April 2005 in the proceedings after conviction the following took place: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Defence Counsel 
        :………I should advise your Honour that the issue of duress, you may [remember] that during the occurrence of the trial a defence of duress of circumstances was raised and taken away by your Honour from the jury’s consideration, that nonetheless my client’s belief such as it was as to why it was necessary to commit these offences is a relevant fact on sentence. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Well if I accept he had that belief…sometimes it was a bit hard to accept. 
         
         
        DEFENCE COUNSEL: There is a, I do have a witness I think outside the Court who has known Mr Clarkson for a period of years and will testify as to issues of his evasiveness in relation to disclosing where he lives et cetera. If your Honour wishes to hear that evidence I can call that-- 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Well -- 
         
         
        DEFENCE COUNSEL: But it goes to the issue very much of the duress of circumstances that he did this because he was afraid of what would happen in terms of what was happening in the Victorian underworld in those years up to 2000. Those are my instructions your Honour. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Well look it is a matter for you… whether you want to call that evidence or not. All I direct your attention to is this fact that some of the evidence that your client gave before the jury seemed to be bordering on the bizarre to me. 
        
       
       
      There then followed a discussion between defence counsel and the Judge as to the relevance of the material that the appellant had raised during the trial. 
       
      
    277 The appellant did not give evidence at the sentencing proceedings and no further application was made by the appellant or his legal representative to call witnesses. There was nothing that the Judge had done during the trial that prevented the appellant giving or calling evidence at the sentencing hearing and it is clear that counsel did not believe he was precluded from calling such evidence. The Judge, however, had the evidence given by the appellant during the trial as to the background to the offences but was not prepared to accept it as being in any way mitigating of the offences. The Judge said during the sentencing remarks that he regarded the evidence “with great suspicion” and that the appellant’s account of needing the passports to secure accommodation as “highly improbable”. The appellant had the onus of proving his account on the balance of probabilities so far as the sentencing proceedings were concerned if it was to be used to mitigate the seriousness of the offending. The Judge was perfectly entitled to reject the account or at least to find that it did not mitigate the seriousness of the offences given his view that they involved some sophistication and elaborate planning. 
     
      
    278 The appellant in his written submissions stated that named persons were present at the hearing and could have given evidence on his behalf. Presumably these include the person to whom defence counsel referred in the passage just quoted. However, no witnesses were called before the Judge and no application was made to call them before this Court. There is no material from the appellant’s legal representatives explaining why they were not called on sentence. It seems counsel decided against taking that course. But it is clear that defence counsel did not think that anything that had occurred in the trial precluded him from calling witnesses on the issue of the accused’s explanation for the offences. There was no reason for not calling other witnesses that might be relevant to the appellant’s rehabilitation after release from custody if those witnesses were available. The appellant complains that the Judge was obliged to hear such evidence but there was no attempt made to call it and no reason has been given for not having done so. 
     
      
    279 The appellant further complains that he wanted to give and call evidence as to the effect upon him of other criminal proceedings in Victoria and the sentences he served in that State in what he described as “filth and squalor” as a result of what he says was a corrupt criminal justice system. The impact of the past prosecutions or sentences served by the appellant was not a matter raised during the sentencing hearing and he cannot now complain that the Judge did not hear evidence on that topic. These grounds should be rejected. 
     
      
    280 Ground 47 complains that the Judge took into account irrelevant material and failed to give weight to relevant considerations. In particular it is said that the Judge gave improper weight to the appellant’s criminal antecedents, the sophistication in the methodology in the commission of the offences, the effect upon the “protocols for the issuing of Australian passports” and the “danger posed to the National Security of Australia and other countries”. The appellant refers to the fact that the Judge said that he would “factor in” that some of the convictions in Victoria might be subject to an inquiry. The appellant complains that it is not clear what the Judge meant by that remark and that in some way he might have used it to his disadvantage. With respect I am not sure what the Judge meant either but it is impossible to see how it was to be taken other than in the appellant’s favour. In any event the appellant’s record had limited value and merely showed that his dishonesty in committing these offences was not an aberration. There is no merit in the complaint that the Judge increased the sentences by reason of the earlier record or that he used the record to override the fact that the appellant had successfully completed his period on parole without further offending. 
     
      
    281 The appellant notes that, although the scheme employed to obtain the passports and license was “sophisticated and complex”, they would inevitably have led back to him if they were investigated. He points out that the offences occurred prior to the 9/11 attack upon the United States and that since that event the “landscape had changed”. He points out that the passport laws have now been tightened. Similarly the danger to Australia had been reduced by the change of laws and protocols for obtaining passports. He submits that the seriousness of the offences should be considered at the time of the offending and not by current circumstances. 
     
      
    282 However the only relevant statement made by the Judge was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It is clearly contrary to Australia’s interests and perhaps even security for people to make false passport applications or to assist others in doing so. 
        
       
       
      I cannot see how that statement overestimated the seriousness of the appellant’s offending or gives rise to the complaint being made by the appellant. It seems to me to be a relatively uncontroversial statement and applicable whatever be the “landscape” at the time of offending. There has been no miscarriage of the Judge’s discretion by taking into account irrelevant considerations. 
       
      
    283 Ground 48 complains that the Judge erred in not receiving relevant facts including: that the appellant was not the principal offender in the passport offences or involved in offences committed by persons holding the passports; the appellant held an Australian passport; the appellant held a NSW driver’s licence; the offences were inexorably linked to him and would have inevitably been detected; the appellant did not use the passport for travel; the appellant did not use the driver’s licences to drive; he did not use the passports or licences to commit other offences. 
     
      
    284 The appellant asserts that the s10(1)(b) offences were less serious than the s10(1)(a) offences and yet he was given the same penalty. He submits that there was no evidence that he was involved in the criminal purpose of the persons using the passports. Both offences carried the same maximum penalty and it is clear that the Judge treated them as being part of the same criminal enterprise whatever that was. Because the appellant’s explanation was not accepted there was no evidence of what his criminal purpose was for making the false statements. The Judge was not required to assume that criminality involved in one type of offence was any less serious than in the other type. In any event the sentence for each offence was only 9 months as against a maximum penalty of two years so it could not be said that the penalties for any of the offences was excessive. 
     
      
    285 The appellant under this ground also asserts that the Judge must have taken into account an allegation, said to be erroneous, in the Crown submissions on sentence that the respondent committed the offence in Count 12 while on bail. The appellant accepts that there was no reference to this fact made by the Judge during the sentencing proceedings or in his remarks, yet asserts that the Judge was referring to this fact in the following passage in the sentencing remarks in the phrase underlined: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…………Far from being remorseful, the whole tenor of the offender’s evidence during the trial, was that he considers that he acted perfectly reasonably in the circumstances. Whether he is self-delusional or whether  
        he considers that the laws prohibiting what he did somehow did not apply to him 
        , I do not know. However, it is necessary to impose sentences which will make it plain to the offender that what he did represented serious breaches of the criminal law” 
        
       
       
      It is clear considering the whole passage that the Judge was referring to the applicant’s attitude in his explanation for the offending rather than referring to the allegation that he committed one of the offences on bail. 
       
      
    286 The fact that the appellant might have been entitled to hold a passport and did hold one or that he was entitled to hold a driver’s licence and did hold one is completely irrelevant in my opinion as a matter of mitigation. Nor is the fact that he did not use the passport for travel or the licences to drive a matter of any significance. Although the appellant rightly submits that the offences involving the licences were not in the worst category of an offence under s 184, the Judge did not say they were and the sentence of 6 months on each as against a maximum penalty of 7 years does not suggest that he treated them as being of the most serious nature. Although it is not asserted that the appellant was using the passports to commit crimes, he was not sentenced on the basis that he was. He was sentenced for the criminality involved in obtaining or assisting others to obtain passports. The fact that the offences might have been linked to the appellant and traced to him is not a matter of mitigation particularly when the appellant accepts that there was a degree of sophistication and planning involved in the offences. 
     
      
    287 In my opinion there is no error shown in the exercise of the Judge’s sentencing discretion. The sentences were in my view moderate having regard to the totality of the appellant’s criminality and considering that they were imposed after trial and in light of the appellant’s lack of remorse. I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The Court delivered its judgment dismissing the appeal in this matter on 16 March 2007. That order was entered by the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal, without a request from the parties, on the same day. 
     
      
    2 The Crown has now made an application to the Court that it should, in the interests of justice, reopen the appeal. In circumstances which I shall explain it is accepted by the parties that the understanding which the Court had of evidence at the trial was in some respects not correct. The parties have generally agreed the matters which were not in evidence. I have detailed them below. 
     
      
    3 The respondent to this application, Mr Burrell, (I shall refer to him as the respondent in these reasons) submitted that this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the Crown’s application. He also submitted that in order to avoid any apprehension of bias the Crown’s application should be heard by a Court of Criminal Appeal differently constituted. There is no allegation of actual bias. Against the eventuality that the Court as presently constituted determines that the Court of Criminal Appeal has jurisdiction in the matter the respondent submitted that it should be resolved by a differently constituted court. 
     
      
       
      Apprehended bias 
       
      
    4 The respondent submitted that, in the circumstances where this Court had determined the appeal, although it had a misunderstanding of some of the facts in the Crown case, if it was to entertain an application to reopen and redetermine the matter there would be a reasonable apprehension in the ordinary fair minded person that the Court may be biased. The submission was put that any decision which the Court, as presently constituted, might make in relation to the relevant evidentiary material “may be tainted by the Court’s prior consideration of the irrelevant and highly prejudicial material.”  
     
      
    5 The relevant principles by which a submission of apprehended bias is to be considered are well known. In Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at (492) [11]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been established by a series of decisions of this Court that the test to be applied in Australia in determining whether a judge is disqualified by reason of the appearance of bias (which, in the present case, was said to take the form of prejudgment) is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide eg  
        Re Lusink; Ex parte Shaw  
        (1980) 55 ALJR 12, 32 ALR 47;  
        Livesey v NSW Bar Association  
        (1983) 151 CLR 288;  
        Vakauta v Kelly  
        (1989) 167 CLR 568;  
        Webb v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 41.” 
        
       
      
    6 In Re JRL; ex part CJL (1986) 161 CLR 342 Mason J said (at 352): 
     
      
       
        
        “It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the ground of disqualification is a reasonable apprehension that the judicial officer will not decide the case impartially or without prejudice, rather than that he will decide the case adversely to one party. There may be many situations in which previous decisions of a judicial officer on issues of fact and law may generate an expectation that he is likely to decide issues in a particular case adversely to one of the parties. But this does not mean either that he will approach the issues in that case otherwise than with an impartial and unprejudiced mind in the sense in which that expression is used in the authorities or that his previous decisions provide an acceptable basis for inferring that there is a reasonable apprehension that he will approach the issues in this way. In cases of this kind, disqualification is only made out by showing that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias by reason of prejudgment and this must be ""firmly established"": Reg v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; Ex parte Angliss Group (1969) 122 CLR 546 at pp 553-554; Watson (1976) 136 CLR 248 at p 262; Re Lusink; Ex parte Shaw (1980) 55 ALJR 12 at p 14. Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a judge, they will have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour.” 
        
       
      
    7 It is important when considering a submission of apprehended bias in a judicial officer to bear in mind the assumptions which must inform that consideration. Objectivity, independence and firmness of mind are essential characteristics of a judge. A judge will be assumed to have a capacity to put from his or her mind evidence of a prejudicial kind which has been heard or seen but is not relevant to the determination of the question before the Court. In the State of Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation (1982) 152 CLR 25 Gibbs CJ rejected the suggestion that a judge could be influenced by the media. In the course of his reasons the Chief Justice said (at 58): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is the everyday task of a judge to put out of his mind evidence of the most prejudicial kind that he has heard and rejected as inadmissible.” 
        
       
      
    8 In the same case Stephen J said (at 76): 
     
      
       
        
        “Judges are necessarily engaged daily in hearing and later banishing from their minds evidence which is of a prejudicial nature and which proves to be inadmissible. They should both by experience and training, be better able to do so than most people.” 
        
       
      
    9 In Johnson at [12]-[13] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
         “At the same time, two things need to be remembered: the observer is taken to be reasonable; and the person being observed is ""a professional judge whose training, tradition and oath or affirmation require [the judge] to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial"" (Vakauta v Kelly (1988) 13 NSWLR 502 at 527, per McHugh JA, adopted in Vakauta v Kelly (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 584-585, per Toohey J) 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst the fictional observer, by reference to whom the test is formulated, is not to be assumed to have a detailed knowledge of the law, or of the character or ability of a particular judge (Webb v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 73, per Deane J), the reasonableness of any suggested apprehension of bias is to be considered in the context of ordinary judicial practice. The rules and conventions governing such practice are not frozen in time……” 
        
       
      
    10 Callinan J said (at 517-518 [80]): 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the latter however it is important to keep in mind that the notional, fair-minded observer is a rational person not unacquainted with the legal process, the oath or affirmation that judges have taken and judicial obligations generally, and in broad terms what has occurred and may occur in the case before and after the challenged conduct.” 
        
       
      
    11 In many of the cases to which I later refer, where an application to reopen an appeal has been made it has been determined by the Court as constituted when the original appeal was heard. I am not aware that it has ever been suggested that the Court as so constituted cannot entertain the application. There are many occasions upon which a judge, either at trial or on an appeal, may be asked to reconsider a ruling which he or she has made, a factual determination or a decision upon a matter of law. Matters are routinely returned from an appellate court to the trial judge to be determined according to law. The ordinary fair minded person understands that in the exercise of the judicial function it will be necessary, from time to time, for a judge to reconsider matters which have previously been considered or which may have been pronounced upon by that particular judge. Such a person, properly informed, would not in my opinion reasonably apprehend that the judge or judges would bring other than an impartial mind to the determination of the matter: (R v Reid (2004) 148 A Crim R 425 (at 431) [26]); R v Kearns [2003] NSWCCA 367). 
     
      
    12 The position may be different where a judge has expressed a view about the credit of a witness (see Yuill v Spedley Securities Ltd (in liquidation) & Ors NSWCCA, unreported, 8 May 1992) (see also Smith v NSW Bar Association (1992) 176 CLR 256). In Antoun v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 497 the High Court found that a trial judge should have disqualified himself from hearing the matter when, before submissions were made, the judge stated emphatically that he would not accept them. It was determined that the judge had presented an unmistakable appearance of prejudgment and had failed to display appropriate standards of fairness and detachment. 
     
      
    13 Cases of that type are quite different to the present matter. This Court is required to consider whether it has jurisdiction to consider the Crown’s application and, if so, to consider the evidence at trial and determine, inter alia, whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the charges beyond reasonable doubt. The answer to that question may vary depending upon the evidence which was admitted at the trial. When, as has happened, the Court is made aware that it has determined the matter upon a misunderstanding of the relevant facts no reasonable person properly informed would assume that, being made aware of the correct facts, a judge would do other than impartially determine the matter having regard to those facts. 
     
      
       
      Jurisdiction 
       
      
    14 A review of the relevant authorities indicates that the extent of the jurisdiction of a court of appeal to reopen a matter which has been heard and orders made has received consideration on a number of occasions. Although there is a fundamental public interest in the finality of litigation the courts have also been concerned to ensure that parties receive a fair hearing and a determination of the matter upon its merits. Particular difficulties arise when the orders have been perfected. 
     
      
    15 In Grierson v The King (1938) 60 CLR 431 the High Court confirmed that the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal is provided by the Court of Criminal Appeal Act (NSW) 1912. Confined to the provisions of that Act Dixon J, with whom McTiernan J, agreed said (at 436) that this Court “has no authority to review its own decision pronounced upon a hearing inter partes after the decision has passed into a judgment formally drawn up.”  
     
      
    16 As Hodgson JA identified in R v Reardon (2004) 146 A Crim R 475 Grierson was considered in Jones v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 409; 39 A Crim R 400. The problem in that case was that the appeal court had not considered all of the appellant’s arguments. The argument in the High Court on an application for special leave to appeal proceeded on the footing that, because the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal had been perfected, it was not possible to move the Court of Criminal Appeal to determine grounds of appeal which had been left undetermined. Mason CJ and Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ left open the question of whether or not the assumption was correct. However, and in my opinion, of significance, was their expression of regret that the Court of Criminal Appeal had not been approached before the order was perfected. 
     
      
    17 The question was again considered in Pantorno v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 466; 38 A Crim R 258. In that case special leave to appeal to the High Court was sought on a ground which had not been argued in the Court below. Mason CJ and Brennan J, after emphasising that failure to argue a point before a Court of Criminal Appeal presents a considerable obstacle to an applicant seeking special leave, recognised (at p 474:264) that a court of criminal appeal “may have to give further consideration to issues which were relegated to the margin of attention during the argument, though it is not required to consider new grounds which counsel abstained from raising on the appeal.” Their Honours later said: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, as there seems to have been an erroneous view in some sections of the legal profession (now hopefully corrected) that no application can be made to a court of criminal appeal once its judgment is pronounced, it is not a fatal objection to the grant of special leave is this case.” 
        
       
      
    18 Their Honours found that a failure to consider the additional grounds had the consequence that the appellant had been denied natural justice. 
     
      
    19 In that case Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (at 484:271): 
     
      
       
        
        “There is one further matter which should be mentioned. It is that the application for special leave to appeal to this Court was argued on the basis that, once judgment had been delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal or (at the latest) once the judgment had been perfected, the jurisdiction of that Court was exhausted. In a case such as the present where there has been an inadvertent denial of procedural fairness in a criminal matter by a Court of Criminal Appeal, it would ordinarily be preferable that the matter be dealt with by further application to that Court.” 
        
       
      
    20 The issue was again referred to by the High Court in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 where Dawson and Gaudron JJ said (at 300): 
     
      
       
        
        “If a final order was made perfecting the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on Postiglione’s first application, the assumption of jurisdiction to entertain his second application and the ensuing appeal was contrary to the decision of this Court in  
        Grierson v The King 
        . It was held in that case that the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        1912 (NSW) does not confer jurisdiction to reopen an appeal which has been  
        heard on the merits 
         and  
        finally 
         determined. A fortiori, in a case where what is involved is the hearing of a second appeal.  
        Pantorno  
        does not suggest otherwise. The view was expressed in

        that an intermediate court of appeal can entertain an application to remedy a denial of procedural fairness whether or not its order has been perfected. Nothing was said as to the jurisdiction of an appellate court to entertain a second appeal when the first has been heard and determined on the merits and an order perfected.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    21 Gummow J (at p 327) expressly agreed with the relevant passage in the judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ. However, McHugh J considered the matter was foreclosed by Grierson. 
     
      
    22 The consequence is that an application which is in effect a second appeal must be rejected. But where there has been a denial of procedural fairness, whether or not the Court’s order has been perfected, there has been no hearing on the merits and the matter has not been finally determined. For this reason, mindful of the fact that it will only be appropriate to do so in exceptional cases, a court may reopen the appeal. 
     
      
    23 In Pettigrew v R (1996) 89 A Crim R 1 the Court of Appeal in Queensland held that where the Court had proceeded to determine an appeal on an erroneous basis it could entertain an application to reconsider the matter. The order which was sought to be set aside had been entered. After giving consideration to the relevant provisions of the Act constituting the Court it was determined that the Court had power to entertain the application. In the course of his reasons Fitzgerald P noted that there was only a limited opportunity for further appeal (p 5 and footnote 8). Grierson was decided at a time when there was an appeal as of right to the High Court. That situation has long since changed and with the introduction of the requirement to obtain special leave to appeal (s 35(2) Judiciary Act 1903) in the overwhelming majority of cases the decision of the intermediate appellate court will be the final determination of the matter. 
     
      
    24 The issue has been considered by this Court on a number of occasions. In R v Lapa (No 2) (1995) 80 A Crim R 398 the appellant complained that the Court of Criminal Appeal had not determined one of the grounds of appeal. In that case the application was made before the order had been entered. However, entry of the order occurred after the application to reopen was made and before judgment on that application was given. The Court of Criminal Appeal was satisfied that it could review its judgment at any time until its order had been perfected. It further held that the power of the Court was not lost by the administrative act which perfected the order after the application to reopen had been made. 
     
      
    25 In his reasons for judgment Clarke JA emphasised that the approach to a question of reopening a criminal appeal raises different considerations to the circumstances where it is sought to reopen civil proceedings. Criminal proceedings affect only the rights of the accused and the Crown. They do not affect the rights of third parties. Although his Honour accepted that the principle of finality is of “first importance” he questioned: 
     
      
       
        
        “whether it should operate so as to close off automatically any reconsideration of a judgment after it has been perfected, at least where questions of status and the rights of third parties are not concerned. To take the instant case as an example – why should the rights of the parties be so dramatically affected by the administrative actions of a court officer?” 
        
       
       
        
        Where an application for consideration of a judgment is made before the judgment is perfected a court accords great weight to the principle of finality and, primarily for this reason, it is only in rare cases that it does accede to the application. A similar approach in cases where a judgment has been perfected would, in my opinion, more readily meet broad considerations of justice than the present rule does” (at 403). 
        
       
      
    26 In R v McNamara (No 2) [1997] 1 VR 257; (1996) 86 A Crim R 339 the appellant complained that one of his grounds of appeal had not been fully heard and disposed of on the merits. The Court of Appeal rejected his application to reopen the appeal and held that it was bound by Grierson.  
     
      
    27 In R v Saxon (1998) 101 A Crim R 71 an appeal against conviction had been dismissed and the order of the Court perfected. The appellant sought to bring a further appeal based upon fresh evidence. The Court held that Grierson precluded the making of any application to bring a fresh appeal, except in circumstances where an earlier appeal may have been abandoned. 
     
      
    28 However, Sperling J who joined in the decision of the Court said (at 82): 
     
      
       
        
        “Where there has been a denial of procedural fairness, the matter has not been heard and determined according to law and entry of the prior order does not therefore perfect a determination;  
        Pantorno  
        and  
        McNamara 
        .” 
        
       
      
    29 In R v Gust [2000] NSWCCA 287 this Court held that a court did have power to grant an application to reopen the hearing of an appeal if an applicant could show that he had been denied procedural fairness even when judgment had been perfected. 
     
      
    30 In DJL v Central Authority (2000) 201 CLR 226 Callinan J acknowledged that a court has an inherent power to reopen defective orders, inter alia, in the event of a failure to give a party a hearing notwithstanding that an order may have been perfected [189] 
     
      
    31 In R v Giri (No 2) [2001] NSWCCA 234 the appellant argued that he had been denied natural justice by the Court of Criminal Appeal. He applied to have the appeal reopened and further submissions considered. Although the Court rejected the application Heydon JA said (at [17]): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that an appellate court may reopen a case which has already been decided if it was decided on a point on which the losing party has, without personal fault, not been heard;  
        Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2)  
        (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 302, 308, 312, 317 and 322. It is also the case that an appellate court may reopen a case which has already been decided on other grounds:  
        Autodesk 
         at 302 and 322.” 
        
       
      
    32 However his Honour emphasised that (at [17]): 
     
      
       
        
        “according to Mason ACJ Wilson and Brennan JJ in  
        Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council 
         (1982) 149 CLR 672 at 684, in practice the circumstances; 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘are extremely rare. The public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation necessarily means that the power to reopen to enable a rehearing must be exercised with great caution.’ 
          
         
        
       
      
    33 In R v Reardon, Hodgson JA reviewed these authorities and expressed the view that “what was said in Jones, Pantorno and Postiglione is insufficient to displace the binding authority of Grierson to the effect, once an appeal has been heard and determined and the order perfected, there is no jurisdiction to reopen the appeal.” (at 487 [41]) 
     
      
    34 However, his Honour acknowledged, at 487[41] that “this is subject to the slip rule, and the possibility of separate proceedings to set aside orders obtained by fraud.” His Honour also accepted that the “principle applies when an appeal has been heard and determined; and leaves open the possibility that if there are grounds of appeal which are not determined at all, it could be said that the appeal has not been determined.” 
     
      
    35 In Roy Carrion v R (2002) 128 A Crim R 29 Wood CJ at CL when considering the problem in the context of a “slip”, carried out a comprehensive review of the authorities. This included the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v Allen [1994] 1 Qd R 526. In that case the Court held that it had inherent jurisdiction to vary an order which it had originally made so as to allow an appellant to argue a further ground of appeal. This was done, although the order on appeal had been perfected. Wood CJ at CL recognised that the Court’s jurisdiction which he described as “inherent” lay in the fact that “‘the interests of justice’ required the Court’s intervention” (at p 32[18]). 
     
      
    36 In AN (No 2) v The Queen (2006) 163 A Crim R 133 NSWCCA 218 this Court again considered whether under the slip rule, or by virtue of some inherent or implied power, this Court has jurisdiction so that it is able to correct orders which have been entered to reflect its true intention. James J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, concluded that this Court may correct an error in an order it has made “arising from a slip or accidental omission even after the order has been perfected.” (p 140 [42]) 
     
      
    37 Before leaving a review of the authorities I should record the fact that in civil proceedings intermediate courts of appeal have granted applications to reopen the appeal. In NSW Bar Association v Smith, unreported, 4 July 1991 the NSW Court of Appeal was satisfied that it had made an error in determining the original appeal, reopened the matter, and proceeded to determine it on the correct facts. The order had not been taken out. 
     
      
    38 In McAdam (No 2) [2001] SASC 206 the South Australian Full Court permitted an appellant to reopen the matter after the order in the previous appeal had been sealed.  
     
      
    39 Consideration of these decisions persuades me that this Court has jurisdiction to consider the Crown application. That jurisdiction does not come from the application of a “slip rule” but from the implied power of this Court to do justice to the parties. In order to do justice an appeal must be “heard and finally determined on its merits.” 
     
      
    40 It is not entirely irrelevant that the orders of the Court were entered on the same day and shortly after judgment was delivered. This act of the Registrar, no doubt carried out with an eye to efficiency, had the consequence that the parties were denied the opportunity to consider the lengthy and detailed reasons for judgment and move the Court before judgment was entered. For my part I would, if so minded, be reluctant to embrace a rule which would preclude the making of the present application in circumstances where the parties had no opportunity to consider the reasons for judgment before a clerical act, which they neither initiated nor in respect of which they had any control was undertaken. I am not unmindful of the fact that if this Court does not entertain the application its judgment will stand with all parties, including the Court, now being aware that the factual basis for the judgment was not correct. Although this would no doubt feature in a submission seeking special leave to appeal to the High Court, these circumstances would, if uncorrected, have a tendency to undermine confidence in the courts. Furthermore, I can identify no prejudice to the respondent from the application. If the appeal is reopened and upheld the respondent will succeed. If the appeal is reopened, but rejected, the respondent will suffer no impediment to any application for special leave to appeal which he may make. In the event that such an application is made both the parties and the High Court will have available a correct understanding of the factual matrix upon which the appeal would be determined, with the benefit of this Court’s view about the appeal having regard to the correct facts. 
     
      
    41 In this case the appeal has been determined and reasons published upon a false understanding as to some matters. The appeal has not been determined in relation to the relevant evidence. For that reason it has not been finally determined. If the matter is to be determined on its merits, that evidence, and that evidence only, must be considered. The circumstances of this case are exceptional. Public confidence in the criminal justice system depends upon courts making decisions which so far as possible are based upon the relevant facts to which the correct legal principles have been applied. In my opinion this Court should intervene, recognise the errors and determine the matter having regard to a correct understanding of the facts and provide reasons accordingly. 
     
      
       
      The circumstances of this case 
       
      
    42 The appeal to this Court arises from a trial conducted before Barr J and a jury. In an earlier trial on these charges the jury failed to agree. There had also been a series of pre-trial applications in relation to various matters including evidentiary questions considered by Sully J and Wood CJ at CL. None of the earlier history of the matter was of relevance to the determination of this appeal. However, it was agreed at the trial before Barr J that earlier rulings would not be reargued, the same ruling being made for the reasons which had been earlier given. 
     
      
    43 The submissions and accompanying documents delivered to this Court were voluminous. In part this was inevitable given the length and complexity of the trial. In a folder which was provided to the Court by the respondent lengthy written submissions were included. Immediately following those submissions was a document entitled “Crown case statement – facts alleged in the Crown case.” Although dated at a time which might have alerted the Court that it was no longer relevant, the Court was not informed that this was the case. The document provided a lucid and succinct account of apparently relevant matters. It had been prepared by the Crown but was provided to the Court by the respondent. Given the very significant bulk of written material, including transcript and a multitude of submissions and judgments which were provided to the Court without, in some cases, any guidance as to their relevance or utility, the document appeared to be a useful summary of the Crown case at the trial. The lesson to be learned is that counsel should ensure that the material which is filed is relevant to the grounds of appeal to be argued and may be relied upon by the Court. If not relevant it should not be filed. If it happens that the document was relevant when filed, but cannot be relied upon, this must be made plain to the Court. 
     
      
       
      Factual errors 
       
      
    44 The parties were asked to agree as to the factual matters recorded in my judgment which were not in evidence. An analysis of the submissions identified the following matters: 
     
      
       
      1. The material at [16] referring to the allegations of investments in Tasmania and prospective improvements at Hillydale was not led at the trial. Accordingly the whole of paragraph [16] is inaccurate. This matter is again referred to in [306]. I shall refer to this paragraph later. 
       
       
      2. My account of the evidence of Sean Buckley in [12] and [15] was erroneous in so far as the Crown did not allege that the appellant had sought to involve Mr Buckley in a fraud. 
       
       
      3. In [20] I recorded an allegation that James Whelan overheard a conversation with the appellant. That allegation was not tendered at the trial. The material in the sentences, “The appellant was overheard by James Whelan to say that he had called by because he ‘just went to the pistol club at Lithgow.’ This statement was false as the appellant had not been to the pistol club and was not on his way to it”, did not form part of the evidence. 
       
       
      4. In [22] I recorded an alleged conversation between Ms Minton-Taylor and Mrs Whelan in which the latter was alleged to have said “that bastard, why did he do this to me.” That evidence was not led at the trial and the matter in [22] should be excluded from consideration. The matter is again referred to in [151]. It must be excluded from consideration in the appeal. 
       
       
      5. In [38] I say “it was the Crown case that the indistinct passenger could be seen on the front seat.” This was not submitted by the Crown and should be excluded from consideration. 
       
       
      6. In [109] I refer to the police finding an empty chloroform bottle at the appellant’s home. This evidence was not led at the trial. The first “dot point” in the paragraph should be excluded from consideration. I also refer to that matter in [154]. There is further reference to chloroform in [111]-[112]. The Crown did not put its case on this basis and accordingly these references are not correct. The sentence “It was the Crown case that Mrs Whelan was not subdued by violence but rather the appellant used a stupefying substance, namely the chloroform of which the residue was found in a bottle at his home” and the sentence “Use of chloroform would minimise the opportunity for Mrs Whelan’s DNA to be deposited on the motor vehicle” are not correct. 
       
       
      7. In [109] I refer to extracts from the UBD Directory. Although one page was tendered at the trial, the pages which showed the route to Smithfield were excluded. To this extent [109] is not correct. 
       
      
    45 Apart from these matters the respondent submitted that there were further inaccuracies in the reasons for judgment. In relation to para [20] it was submitted that although “relevant staff gave evidence that no one had rung that morning not necessarily all relevant staff gave evidence on this topic.” My understanding is that [20] reflects the Crown position at the trial and accordingly does not need reconsideration. 
     
      
    46 In relation to [27] and [28] the respondent submitted that the Crown argued at the trial that Mrs Whelan “exited the car park ramp and got into the appellant’s vehicle and the Crown could not exclude that she went left after exiting the car park. She may not have considered which direction she was going to walk in on Phillip Street when walking up the ramp or having walked up the ramp met and then walked with or was called over by the person described by Mr Elliott.” The Crown submitted that [27] and [28] correctly reflect the Crown’s position at the trial. At the request of the parties the Court was asked to view the relevant video footage. I am satisfied that [27] and [28] accurately reflect the Crown case at trial. In so far as I express my own conclusions in [28] they were arrived at after viewing the video. 
     
      
    47 In relation to [35] the respondent submitted that video footage could not conclusively confirm that the windscreen was dirty in the absence of comparative images. My reference in [35] to examination of the video footage was made in consideration of my own observations of the video. 
     
      
    48 In relation to [36] the Crown accepts that it did not assert that the images from cameras 7 and 8 positively excluded the possibility of Mrs Whelan having crossed the road and walked west on the southern footpath. However, it did submit that the video footage provided strong support for the proposition that it was unlikely that she did cross the road and walk west on the southern footpath. To that extent the penultimate sentence in [36] requires reconsideration. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the appeal 
       
      
    49 The question which arises is whether, with a correct understanding of the matters in the Crown case, the appeal should be upheld. For reasons to which I refer below these matters are not relevant to grounds 3-7 inclusive. It was not submitted that they are relevant to grounds 8 and 9. 
     
      
    50 In relation to grounds 1 and 2 the correction of the Court’s understanding of the Crown case does not cause me to reach a different conclusion about those grounds. I refer in [151] of my original reasons to the fact that there was an unexplained comment by Mrs Whelan “why did he do this to me.” The deletion of that matter from the relevant facts in no way affects my conclusion that there was a body of evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that the appellant abducted and killed Mrs Whelan. My purpose in including a reference to this conversation was to illustrate the fact that there were matters beyond the three bodies of evidence central to the Crown case which the jury were obliged to consider. It is not material to my conclusion. 
     
      
    51 In [154] I included the reference to the “almost empty bottle of chloroform.” As with the alleged remarks made by Mrs Whelan, the deletion of that matter does not alter the reasoning in that part of the judgment. Both [151] and [154] were included to indicate that the Crown case involved complex circumstantial evidence. Their exclusion does not diminish that conclusion.  
     
      
    52 I did not expressly refer to other matters which, as it happens, were not in evidence when resolving grounds 1 and 2. Even if I had, the reasoning and conclusion with respect to those grounds would not alter.  
     
      
    53 In ground 10 the appellant submitted that the verdicts were “unsafe and unsatisfactory and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.” In the course of my discussion of this ground I said that there were “some features of the evidence upon which the Crown relied at the trial which in my opinion had little probative value.” … but … “I am satisfied that on the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty.”  
     
      
    54 I said in [306] that one of the elements in the Crown case which led me to this conclusion was that “the appellant was in serious financial difficulty and had lost the support of his former wife. He was unemployed with outgoings in excess of his income. He asked for and then demanded money from Mr Buckley.” I went on to say “notwithstanding his impecunious state he had raised the possibility of relocating to Tasmania with the prospect of making a significant capital investment in a winery.” The removal of this latter allegation from the matters before the jury does not, in my opinion, have any significance. The Crown proved that the appellant was in serious financial difficulty which provided a motivation for him to seek to extort money. To my mind that finding was clearly open, irrespective of the exclusion of the allegations in relation to prospective investment in Tasmania. To the extent that I relied in [306] on the appellant’s dealings with Mr Buckley the observation was accurate. It was the Crown case that the appellant had demanded money from Mr Buckley. 
     
      
    55 In [314] I discuss the evidence in relation to the UBD street directory. As I understand the position that discussion is an accurate reflection of the extent to which parts of the UBD directory were tendered in evidence. In any event as I indicated in [314] the marking in the street directory “was not of particular significance.” 
     
      
    56 As is apparent from my reasons for rejecting ground 10 none of the other matters which I erroneously understood to form part of the Crown case were of sufficient significance for me to refer to them in the discussion. I have carefully considered the factual matrix of the Crown case without that evidence. The withdrawal of those allegations does not lead me to a different conclusion from that which I previously expressed. As I said in [318] “the combination of circumstances including (the appellant’s) visit to the Whelan’s residence, the evidence relating to the Pajero, the dot point notes and the telephone call on 23 May are compelling”, I remain of that view. The conjunction of these circumstances cannot be reasonably explained otherwise than by the respondent’s guilt. 
     
      
    57 The respondent submitted that by reason of the reference to facts of which evidence was not admitted at the trial it could be determined that this Court had failed to properly discharge its obligations in relation to the consideration of grounds 1, 2 and 10 of the grounds of appeal. Whether or not that submission has substance is not a matter for this Court. However, it is appropriate for me to observe that the factual errors occur primarily in my endeavours to summarise the Crown case. As I have already stated when analysing the grounds of appeal the matters which are erroneously recorded as forming part of the Crown case played no material part in my considerations. 
     
      
    58 Since publishing its judgment the Court has been informed that the appellant had filed a notice indicating that it no longer pressed grounds 3 to 7 inclusive in the Notice of Appeal. We were not told of this in argument and the notice did not come to the Court’s attention before its judgment was published. 
     
      
    59 In my opinion the order of the Court dismissing the appeal should be confirmed.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Judith Hanson appears for sentence today for an offence of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis. The prohibited drug was cocaine. She supplied that drug to an undercover police officer on a number of occasions. On 10 August 2006 she supplied .07 grams of cocaine. On 18 August she supplied two separate quantities .15 of a gram and .16 of a gram of heroin. On 6 September she supplied .1 of a gram of cocaine. The quantities that she supplied to the undercover officer totalled thus .32 grams of cocaine and .16 grams of heroin. 2 What makes this offence serious of course is the ongoing nature of the criminality. The legislature responded to people who were, as Ms Hanson did, regularly supplying drugs by creating the offence of supplying them on an ongoing basis and by its maximum penalty indicated that it should be dealt with as seriously as those who supply on a single occasion much larger quantities of drugs.3 This offence came about when Ms Hanson, who was dabbling in cocaine use at the time, invited a Mr Keating to move into her home. He was a drug supplier and he used the home that he shared with Ms Hanson as the base for his drug supply activities. Eventually Mr Keating left, but his customers would still come around knocking on the door and trying to get drugs. The offender decided that she would supply them. In that sense she took over Mr Keating’s business. She says that she did so in order to get her own drugs for free. By this stage she wasn’t merely dabbling in cocaine use but had a significant habit. By supplying drugs to others she was able to get drugs for her own use, this is not a case of a person profiting in the sense of making large sums of money by any means from what she did.4 Ms Hanson, more than most, should have realised just how wrong her criminal behaviour was. She has had three significant relationships in her life. Two of those ended when her partner died through drug overdose. That Ms Hanson would, in those circumstances, get involved in supplying drugs to others is therefore surprising. It suggests a significant need to impose a sentence on Ms Hanson that will personally deter her from committing offences of this kind in the future. If she is prepared to supply drugs to people after experiencing first hand, on two occasions, the consequences of drug use, then something else needs to be done to persuade her not to indulge in similar offence in the future; and that something else will be the imposition of a sentence of some severity in order to deter Ms Hanson herself. A significant sentence is also required to deter others apart from Ms Hanson who may be tempted to say to themselves “I will get my own drugs for free by supplying to others”. 5 The objective criminality of an offence is a fundamental matter in determining the appropriate sentence and a favourable subjective case cannot be allowed to overwhelm the need to impose a sentence which reflects the objective gravity of someone’s conduct.6 Ms Hanson does present to me in a favourable light. She is, depending on which document you look at, either fifty-four, fifty-five or fifty-six. I do not mean to suggest that she is telling lies about her birth date. Various people have calculated her age differently. I will accept Ms Hanson’s calculation because she should know best, she says she is fifty-five.7 She has a significant criminal history, but for a number of years in more recent times she has remained offence free. In that time she got a job working as a barmaid in a hotel. She lost that job when the hotel was sold. She hopes to return to that work, doing courses whilst in custody which will assist her in regaining that employment. She has done her responsible service of alcohol and a similar course relating to gambling whilst in custody, qualifications which are necessary if she is to be employed in a similar role in the future. 8 Ms Hanson also impresses me as a clever and sensible woman. There is much that is good about Ms Hanson. She has experienced many hardships in her life. I have referred on a couple of occasions to the death of two of her partners. To a third partner she had a daughter who is profoundly disabled. The stress of caring for her disabled daughter clearly had consequences in terms of her relationship with her then partner. Ms Hanson appears to have been a drug user for many years with occasional periods of abstinence. It is her desire to leave custody drug free and to that end she has been reducing her methadone dose. 9 She pleaded guilty at an early stage and so I will discount the sentence I would otherwise impose by twenty-five percent to reflect that fact. She has also expressed her remorse. In a letter to me she realises that she says that now she is thinking clearly and rationally, she realises that she has put the lives of many others at risk by her criminal behaviour. 10 There are special circumstances in this case. They relate to the need for Ms Hanson to be supervised. The fact that she has on an earlier occasions had, for her, lengthy periods without offending suggests that there is hope for the future, especially if she is supervised by the Probation and Parole Service. She has, I am satisfied, good prospects of rehabilitation. 11 Ms Hanson also has some health problems, in particular, she is suffering from the consequences of an injury to her back. That will mean that she spends her time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. Those who have spoken to her of more recent times consider that she is co-operative and cordial. Earlier, when supervised by the Probation and Parole Service, it seems that she was not so, but now she seems to recognise that at her age if she wants to spend a significant period of her life in the future out of gaol she needs to change her ways. 12 Another aspect I should have referred to when talking about the offender spending her time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case concerns the fact that both her parents are now ill and she wishes to spend as much time with them as she can in the future. 13 I return to something which controls the sentence I can impose in this case and that is the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. Ongoing supply of drugs, even small quantities of drugs, is a very serious matter. The community is rightfully concerned about those who supply to street level users. Not the least of these concerns is that those who use drugs almost invariably need to commit offences to obtain them. The consequences of a person such as Ms Hanson, supplying drugs on a regular basis extend far beyond the consequences to the individual purchasers of those drugs. The community is rightfully concerned about the extent of the drug trade and the role of people such as Ms Hanson in it. 14 Despite all the favourable subjective features, and I was quite impressed by Ms Hanson, it remains my duty to impose a sentence which reflects the objective gravity of her conduct and that is what I will now do.15 Ms Hanson went into custody on 27 September 2006 and so the sentence will commence on that day. She is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of three years. I set a non parole period of eighteen months. It will expire on 26 March 2008 on which day Ms Hanson is to be released to parole. I dismiss the back up charges.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: I have before me Andres Munoz who is to be sentenced for, in the grand scheme of Commonwealth offences, a relatively minor drug matter. Police and Customs officials became alerted to a scheme whereby cocaine was being imported into Australia through the Post concealed in roll on deodorant containers. They conducted inquiries which led them to 24 Cato Way, Casula a residence occupied by amongst other people the present offender and his stepmother Carmen. 2 I am to sentence the offender on the basis that his stepmother and the offender were drug users, and in particular users of cocaine. Although there was a reasonable quantity of cocaine found both in roll on deodorant containers and also packaged in other ways at Cato Way, Casula, it is accepted by the Crown for the purposes of sentencing the present offender that he possessed only part of a quantity of cocaine in total weighing 30.3 grams. Of that quantity he possessed only an indeterminate amount which did not exceed 2 grams. I am to sentence the offender on the basis that the offender’s stepmother showed him that 30.3 gram package. The offender realised it was cocaine. He asked her if he could use a couple of grams for his own consumption and she agreed. In those circumstances the offender came into possession of a quantity of cocaine, as I have said less than 2 grams, that quantity being imported. Thus the offender stands to be sentenced for an offence of possessing a quantity of a border control drug, namely cocaine, reasonably suspected of having been imported. 3 The offender was born in Chile, his parents separated when he was four years of age, with his father coming to live in Australia. The offender remained behind in Chile until he was seventeen. He developed a cocaine habit whilst in Chile. He came to Australia at seventeen when he began living with his father and his stepmother. Since then he has spent some time working, on occasions spending all of his money on his cocaine habit. 4 Since his arrest in July 2006 he has taken steps to overcome his drug problem and a pathology report tendered before me today indicates the presence of no drugs, in particular, there is nothing to suggest cocaine use. I should also add the offender has no previous criminal history. 5 Mr Higgins appears for the offender and seeks an order under s20 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. The Prosecution agrees that is an appropriate way of disposing of the matter. In those circumstances that is the order I will make. 6 Under s21(A) Andres Munoz you are convicted but without passing sentence you are released upon a recognisance to be of good behaviour for two years in the sum of five hundred dollars without security.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court. On 11 October 2005 the applicant pleaded guilty to four charges as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years (s 66A  
      Crimes  
      Act 1900) for which the maximum penalty provided by statute is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 
       
       
      Count 2: maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm (s 33  
      Crimes Act  
      1900) for which the maximum penalty provided by statute is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 
       
       
      Counts 3 and 4: assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s 59(1)  
      Crimes Act 
       1900) for which the maximum penalty provided by statute is 5 years imprisonment. 
       
      
    2 The sentencing judge imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: fixed term of 8 years imprisonment commencing on 1 March 2007 and expiring on 28 February 2015; 
       
       
      Count 2: non-parole period of 10 years commencing on 1 March 2007 and expiring on 28 February 2017; with a parole period of five years. 
       
       
      Count 3: fixed term of 9 months imprisonment commencing on 2 June 2006 and expiring on 1 March 2007; 
       
       
      Count 4: fixed term of 9 months imprisonment commencing on 3 September 2005 and expiring on 2 June 2006; 
       
      
    3 Accordingly, the aggregate sentence imposed on the applicant was 16½ years with an effective non-parole period of 11½ years. The sentences in relation to counts 1 and 2 were entirely concurrent. The sentences imposed in relation to counts 3 and 4 were cumulative and were in turn accumulated with the concurrent sentences imposed on counts 1 and 2. 
     
      
    4 The sentencing judge concluded that there was only a limited utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea of guilty and allowed a discount of ten percent. It was entered only on the first day of trial. The sentencing judge also had regard to two periods of pre-sentence custody and backdated the commencement date of the sentence accordingly. Her Honour found special circumstances due to the age of the applicant, the fact that it was his first time in custody and his need for an extended period of supervised parole. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    5 The offences arose from a single incident when the applicant assaulted three children of his girlfriend. Counts 1 and 2 both related to a female child aged 2 years and counts 3 and 4 related to each of two young male children, aged 8 and 4 years. 
     
      
    6 The sentencing judge made comprehensive findings of fact which were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In February 2004 the offender and AR were in a domestic relationship. They had been in this relationship since October 2003. The offender moved into AR’s premises in early December 2003. They lived at those premises with her four children. DF who was aged 17 had also been living at the house for a few days. The children are KP, born 19 January 1995 who was then aged 8 years and 11 months; BP, born 17 April 1997, she was then aged 6 years and 10 months; TP, born 11 June 1999, he was then aged 4 years and 8 months; and MP born 30 May 2001, she was then aged 2 years and 9 months. The children, K, T and M are the victims in this matter. 
        
       
       
        
        On 26 February 2004 AR went to her friend DR’s house. While AR was at the house she consumed a number of Woodstock Bourbon and Cokes. M was left in the care of the offender and DF. The other three children were at school. Earlier that day the offender complained to AR that M had bitten him on the toe. As a consequence AR took disciplinary action against M. AR took her to the bedroom and hit her once on the buttocks with a strap. The strap is approximately one metre in length and is made from plaited nylon. M was told to stay in her room. 
        
       
       
        
        AR then left the house and walked to the nearby school to collect. T. At about 3pm she arrived home and saw the offender standing out the front of her house with M. The offender told AR that he was going to his mother's house with DF - he left M with AR. A short time later K and B arrived home from school. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 6 pm the offender and DF arrived home, they saw AR in the front yard of DR’s premises with T and M. B and K were in the front yard of AR’s premises playing together. At about 6:30pm the offender left. He told DF he was going to the Emerton Hotel. DF remained with K; B went to her mother who, at the time was still at DR’s premises. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 8:30pm B, T and M came home. DF was playing a Sony play station game. At about 8:45pm AR came home and fed and prepared the children for bed. AR told the children to go to their beds, they complied and went to their respective rooms. AR left the house and she returned to her friend's house. DF remained in the lounge room playing the play station. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender arrived home at about 9:15 pm, the offender cooked some food for himself and DF. After they ate the meal they jointly played the play station. At about 10 pm the offender left DF and walked down the hallway. The children were making noises and were restless in their rooms. The offender obtained the nylon strap; the offender then struck T and K on their buttocks with the strap on a number of occasions. As a consequence of being struck, they cried immediately. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then went to M’s room. M was out of her bed at the time. The offender struck her on the buttocks. He then left the room. DF heard the children crying. He considered M’s crying to be ""painful"" so he went to investigate. While DF was investigating, the offender went to the toilet. When DF entered M’s bedroom he saw blood. He felt the mattress and he found it to be wet with blood. He called out to the offender. The offender entered M’s room and picked her up. He took her to the bathroom. He was accompanied by DF. They noticed blood dripping from her vagina. She was still crying. The offender told DF to get AR. DF left the house and told AR that M was bleeding. They returned to the house - a short time later the offender rang for an ambulance. The ambulance arrived at 10:28pm. M was taken to the nearby Mt Druitt Hospital where she was seen by Dr Georgis. He noted she was suffering from vaginal bleeding and in addition she was suffering from multiple bruises on the suprapubic area, lower abdomen, inner thighs, buttocks and back. He also noted clotted blood around the genitalia and inner thighs. 
        
       
       
        
        As a consequence M was transferred to the Children's Hospital at Westmead. M was seen by Dr Glenys Griffiths. Dr Griffiths conducted a genital examination upon M and she found: multiple lesions over her buttocks, some extending to her lower back and upper thighs. These lesions were parallel track like linear markings with some overlying petechial bruises and abrasions. The size of these lesions varied from 3 centimetres to 14 centimetres in length. The lesions were consistent with being hit with a strap. A 6 centimetre by 2 centimetre rectangular shaped blue purple bruise with abrasion of the skin over left groin extending to the mons pubis with an underlying bruise approximately 5 centimetres long which extended further into the groin. A red abrasion 2 centimetres by 2 centimetres on her mons pubis to the left side. Bruising to her labia majora, red brown colour, one centimetre by one centimetre on the left labia majorum, 2 centimetres by 2 centimetres majorum on the right. Abrasions on her right labia majora, approximately one centimetre in length; areas of arrhythma in the upper inner aspects of her labia minora. Blood was observed on the posterior fourchette area with a posterior fourchette tear at 6 o'clock. 
        
       
       
        
        M was required to undergo an examination under general anaesthetic in the operating theatre as the ano-genital examination was unable to be adequately completed. The examination revealed posterior fourchette tear and a complete transection of the hymen at 5 o'clock. The rectum and vaginal canals were both normal. Photographs were taken of the injuries to M’s vulva, hymen and posterior fourchette. 
        
       
       
        
        Later, M told hospital care workers that [the offender] ""touched me down there"" and she asked ""Are you going to punch me in the wee wee?"" Dr Griffiths found the findings were consistent with acute penetrating trauma. She ruled out accidental injury to the hymen on the basis that there was an absence of injury to the external genitalia. She found that whilst the tear to the posterior fourchette could be indicative of accidental injury, the pattern of genital bruising and hymeneal lesions is inconsistent with accidental injury. 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Griffiths also found that an object had been inserted into M’s vagina in order to cause the injuries. She ruled out the possibility the injuries could have been caused by a punch to the vagina or by whipping the child with a strap. 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Griffiths' findings and the photographs taken of M were forwarded to Dr Kieran Moran, the head paediatrician with the Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick. Dr Moran agreed with Dr Griffiths' findings. Dr Moran also ruled out accidental causes for the injury. Dr Moran found that a punch or blow with a fist to the vulval area could not cause injury to the hymen. He stated that injury to the hymen requires the insertion of an object into the vagina. 
        
       
       
        
        KP and TP were also seen by Dr Georgis at Mt Druitt Hospital. Dr Georgis found that K had sustained multiple longitudinal bruises across the buttocks and longitudinal bruises to the left side of the back. Pain killers were administered. Dr Georgis found that T had sustained multiple longitudinal bruises across the buttocks, there was no tenderness or bleeding. Pain killers were also administered to T. 
        
       
       
        
        Police interviewed B, K and T. K told police that the offender had smacked him with a belt on a number of occasions and told him to go to sleep, B told police that the offender did not hit her. She pretended to be asleep. She could hear the offender hitting K and T. She saw the offender hit M with the strap and she then closed her eyes. T told police that the offender hit him with the strap on the bottom on a number of occasions. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender was arrested by police on 27 February 2004. He was taken to Mt Druitt Police Station, he agreed to be interviewed. He informed police that when he came home the children were not making any noise; that while he was playing the play station with DF he could hear noises coming from the children's rooms. He went to investigate. He told them to go to bed and he smacked them with an open hand. He returned to the lounge room, M came out of her room, he told her to go back to bed, he heard a loud crash after she entered her bedroom, he thought she may have hit the ensemble bed in her room. He went to investigate and saw blood on the inside of her thigh. He called out to DF who came to the bedroom. He admitted to previously smacking T on two occasions; he admitted to smacking M on three occasions. He said he used his hand to smack them. He said his hand may have left a red mark on them. He denied using the belt to smack them. He claimed that M bled from the vagina because she may have hit the corner of the bed.” 
        
       
       
      Subjective matters 
       
      
    7 The sentencing judge provided a detailed account of the relevant subjective matters. The applicant was eighteen at the time of the offences and aged twenty at the time he was sentenced. He did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. However, reports were tendered from Mr Peter Ashkar, a clinical psychologist, and the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
    8 The evidence indicated that the applicant had a stable and happy childhood. He had no history of juvenile offending behaviour. He left school in Year 9 and has held a variety of jobs as a factory worker, a forklift driver and a truckie’s offsider. He suffers no apparent mental impairment and, at the time of sentencing, had a regular girlfriend. 
     
      
    9 At the time that he committed the offences the applicant had been in a relationship with the victims’ mother for about six months. She was older than the applicant and had four children from a previous relationship. It would seem that there was regular use of alcohol and cannabis in the household. The evidence disclosed that although the applicant did not use illicit substances he had problems with the abuse of alcohol. He was described by the sentencing judge as “weekend binge drinker.” 
     
      
    10 The applicant told Mr Ashkar that on the evening of the offences he had consumed 12 schooners of beer. He described himself as intoxicated. He said: “I was a bit wobbly on my pushbike.” He told Mr Ashkar that when he arrived home and found his partner had gone to a friend’s place leaving him with the children he was annoyed. When the children would not go to sleep he became frustrated and went into a rage. He said that he smacked the children with an open hand. He said to Mr Ashkar that he had “poked the female child once between her legs with his finger.” He said that he did this because he “knew that would hurt her.” 
     
      
    11 The applicant denied that his assault on the female child was sexually motivated. He denied knowledge of having penetrated her with his finger at the time. He did not believe that hitting a child on the buttocks with an open hand was wrong, although he accepted that it was wrong to have “poked [the child] between the legs.” 
     
      
    12 The applicant apparently told Mr Ashkar that he was sorry for having hurt the children and wished he had never done it. He agreed that he was out of control and accepted that no child deserves to get flogged and touched inappropriately. With the benefit of hindsight he recognised that he should have gone and found the children’s mother and allowed her to resolve the domestic situation. 
     
      
    13 Neuropsychological functioning tests were carried out on the applicant. He demonstrated no personality pathology. He was assessed as being within the moderate high-risk category of sexual and violent recidivism relative to other male sex offenders. However, Mr Ashkar was of the opinion that the results overestimated the risk. In his view the risk of sexual recidivism was more appropriately classified as moderate to low. The factors said to have contributed to the applicant’s offending behaviour are alcohol abuse, negative mood, anger and victim access. The applicant’s behaviour is said to have been grounded in anger and the need for power and control. 
     
      
       
      The remarks of the sentencing judge 
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge noted that Mr Ashkar believed that the offence against the female child was sexually motivated. The applicant denied this. Her Honour concluded that she was “unable to find that the offence was committed for sexual gratification; indeed I find to the contrary.” Her Honour indicated that the lack of sexual gratification was relevant to the matter of sentence: R v Dunn unreported, NSWCCA, 15 April 1992. 
     
      
    15 Her Honour said that she was satisfied that the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on the female child “could hardly be said to be more serious. It is difficult to find other than it comes close to being in the worst class of cases of its kind. It is far more serious than those envisaged as coming within the mid range of objective seriousness.” 
     
      
    16 Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The child] was only two years and nine months at the date of the offences committed against her. Whilst age is an element of the first count, it remains an important factor in assessing the degree of his criminality. The younger the age of the victim, the more serious the criminality. The sexual assault upon her was perpetrated with sufficient force to cause a posterior fourchette tear and a complete transection of the hymen; that is also the act relied upon to found count 2 on the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        The medical evidence, in particular the expert opinion of Dr Glenys Griffiths states ‘significant force would be needed to cause such injuries given that the hymen tissue is distensible.’ There is photographic evidence of a significant amount of blood loss from a small child on her clothing, on the mattress and on the bathroom floor. In addition to the internal injuries she sustained bruising and abrasion to the skin of her groin, her mons pubis, her labia majora and in the upper inner aspects of her labia minor. She needed to be anaesthetised to examine the extent of her injuries. 
        
       
       
        
        There can be no doubt she would have been in considerable pain following these acts of extreme violence. Her screams of pain were such that the young DF came to investigate. In addition she was whipped with a length of plaited nylon rope which left significant bruising which is depicted in the photos and described in the medical evidence. Her injuries alone are a testament to the violence with which the offences were committed. 
        
       
       
        
        The impact of the offences upon [the child] are said to be detailed in a report prepared by a child protection case worker, Monica Gutierrez. Miss Gutierrez was assigned to the case in January 2006. She has conducted a review of [the child’s] case file. [The child] is reported as displaying inappropriate sexualised behaviour, aggressive behaviour and anxiety, all symptoms said to be consistent with the type of abuse she has sustained. It is not clear from the report however whether those symptoms were present initially or continued over the entire period or have abated. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst it is said that the impact of child abuse occurring in the child’s formative critical years impacts enormously upon a child, there is insufficient evidence for me to make any finding that that is so in [the child’s] case in the absence of medical evidence and/or contemporaneous material other than the report prepared by the case worker which I find to be of little assistance.” 
        
       
      
    17 The sentencing judge recognised that the sentencing of the applicant was a difficult exercise. Her Honour acknowledged that the elements of the s 66A offence and s 33 offence overlapped significantly, although they were quite separate and distinct offences. The act of penetration of the girl’s vagina constituted the act of sexual intercourse. This was also the act relied upon as having been done maliciously with intent to do grievous bodily harm in addition to the whipping of the complainant with a length of plaited nylon rope. 
     
      
    18 Her Honour found that there were additional aggravating factors in respect of count 1. There was actual violence used in the penetration of the vagina, the applicant abused his position of trust and the victim was vulnerable, being aged 2 years and 9 months. She was in her own bedroom and in the sanctity of her own home when the offences were committed.  
     
      
    19 In relation to count 2 her Honour found that the injuries inflicted were substantial. She again found that the applicant had abused his position of trust and that the child was of tender years and in her own home. Her Honour found that the actions of the applicant amounted to actions of “gratuitous cruelty in the circumstances, in accordance with the provisions of s 21A(2)(f) and amount to an additional factor of aggravation.” 
     
      
    20 In relation to the offences committed against the two boys her Honour found the physical cruelty inflicted “upon them was clearly brutal.” Both boys were whipped with a plaited nylon rope causing multiple longitudinal bruises across their backs and buttocks.” Her Honour found that the offences were aggravated by the children’s age and, although there were no victim impact statements, her Honour commented that “the long term effects of trauma are well documented.” The offences against the boys were aggravated by their ages and the fact that they were in their own homes when they were assaulted. Her Honour found that the applicant abused a position of trust. 
     
      
    21 Her Honour also commented that the offences were committed in front of another child who was then six years of age. That child had apparently closed her eyes and pretended to be asleep. She saw her sister being struck and heard the boys being assaulted. Her Honour accepted that the experience for her would have been “truly traumatic.” 
     
      
    22 Her Honour found that there was little to be said in mitigation on behalf of the applicant. She did not accept the account given of the offences by the applicant who had initially denied using a belt to smack the children. He had originally claimed that the injuries suffered by the girl were occasioned by contact with the corner of her bed. He originally denied knowledge of the penetration of the girl. 
     
      
    23 Her Honour found that although the applicant estimated he had consumed between 10 to 16 schooners that evening, he nevertheless remembered the offences and accordingly her Honour concluded that “it cannot be said to amount to a mitigating circumstance.” The applicant had attended a drug and alcohol counselling program whilst on remand but, otherwise, her Honour found that he had done nothing to address his offending behaviour. 
     
      
    24 Her Honour noted that the applicant had no criminal antecedents. However, consistent with authority, her Honour indicated that previous good character attracts less weight in cases involving sexual assaults upon children. Her Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This case however is somewhat unusual in its nature. In respect of the first two counts it is a single episode of a very very violent and sadistic nature against [the child]; an offence committed purely with the intention of inflicting maximum pain upon a little girl. There is simply no explanation for the offender’s sudden departure from his previous law-abiding conduct, apart from his quest for power and revenge. That fact alone is of little assistance to him. 
        
       
       
        
        He was, at the time he committed these offences, a very young man. It is well accepted that in the case of youth, general deterrence and public denunciation usually play a subordinate role in the need to have regard to individual treatment aimed at rehabilitation. However, important as that principle is, it cannot defeat the primary purpose of punishment, nor in the circumstances where a young offender conducts himself in a way which an adult does, can it stand in the way of the need to protect society. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The gravity of the crime, the fact the offences involved great violence must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the court’s functions will cease to operate. In other words deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because a person is in their late teens and has committed an objectively serious offence. 
        
       
       
        
        It has been said time and time again that sexual assaults upon young children, especially by those who stand in a position of trust to them, must be severely punished. Heavy custodial sentences are essential if the courts are to play their proper role in protecting young children from sexual assaults by adults. The same must be said about physical assaults upon them also. 
        
       
       
        
        Additionally, when imposing a sentence in respect of counts 1 and 2, the nature of this offender’s criminality calls for a sentence that includes a substantial component of pure punishment. The community and [the child] would be entitled to think that this Court would be failing in its duty if sentences for the offences did not reflect the revulsion which the community would feel upon hearing of the nature of the offences inflicted against this very little girl. 
        
       
       
        
        Only sentences of imprisonment will satisfy the requirements of denunciation and retribution to which I have referred. The sentencing statistics and cases referred to by counsel in their respective addresses are of little assistance in respect of counts 1 and 2. The only decision of any like nature that I could find is that of  
        Regina v Davies 
         to which I have referred. 
        
       
       
        
        The offences of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, attracts standard non-parole periods. In respect of count 1 there is a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment. That is a factor to be taken into account and it operates as a reference point or benchmark or sounding board or guidepost. I have already found there to exist some factors of aggravation which I have referred to above. 
        
       
       
        
        I find that in the circumstances of this case, as horrendous as it may be, the fact remains that the objective seriousness of the offence falls below the mid range envisaged by the legislature when the standard non-parole period was introduced. It must be remembered that s 66A relates to all types of sexual intercourse. This offence entails digital penetration of the vagina, admittedly with force. Absent are other factors which would place the offending behaviour towards the middle or upper end of the range. It has been held for example that a crime involving penile penetration is a more serious form of sexual intercourse than cunnilingus. Obviously I do not resile from my findings that the offence warrants stern punishment. 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of the second count, the maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent, it attracts a standard non-parole period of seven years. I find that the offence falls at the upper end of the range for like offences. The acts were done with malice, with a complete indifference to human suffering and were done wantonly. The objective seriousness of the injuries are heinous as described in the medical reports which are demonstrative of the brutality meted out to this innocent child. I have taken into account the 38 days in custody between 27 February 2004 and 5 April 2004 when bail was granted, and from 10 October when the offender’s bail was revoked and he was remanded in custody pending sentence following the entering of his pleas of guilty.” 
        
       
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    25 Ten grounds of appeal were identified. It is appropriate to deal with them in turn although grounds 1 and 2 can be conveniently dealt with together. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in holding that the applicant’s intoxication could not be regarded as a mitigating factor. 
       
       
      Ground 2: the sentencing judge erred in holding that the applicant’s previous good character was of little assistance to him. 
       
      
    26 I have already identified the fact that the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had consumed a large amount of alcohol before committing the offences. Mr Ashkar found that the alcohol was a contributing acute dynamic factor in the commission of the offences which were “a combined function of his histrionic personality style and alcohol use.” The applicant was described as a weekend binge drinker and, although her Honour did not express it in these terms, it is plain that he had been on a binge on the relevant evening. 
     
      
    27 Her Honour concluded that although the applicant was intoxicated, because he could remember the offences, this could not be “said to amount to a mitigating circumstance.” The applicant complains that this reasoning involves error. In my opinion this submission should be accepted. 
     
      
    28 In R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 Hunt CJ at CL emphasised that in some circumstances “intoxication will mitigate the offence because the offender has by reason of the intoxication acted out of character.” In the present case, although there was evidence that the applicant had a “really bad temper” he had no previous convictions and there was nothing to suggest that he had previously conducted himself in the extraordinary manner which he did on the night of the offences. Her Honour described the position in these words “there is simply no explanation for the offender’s sudden departure from his previous law-abiding conduct, apart from his quest for power and revenge.” 
     
      
    29 I am satisfied that her Honour should not have put aside the role which the applicant’s intoxication played in the commission of the offences. By confining the role of intoxication to the circumstance where the offender is so overwhelmed by alcohol that he or she has no memory of the offences is in my opinion inappropriate. A person’s self control may be severely diminished by excessive alcohol although a memory of the event remains. 
     
      
    30 Her Honour found that the assault on the small girl was not sexually motivated but was committed out of a quest for power and revenge. I understand her Honour to have concluded that the applicant acted when he was overcome by rage because he had been abandoned by his girlfriend and his evening was being disturbed by the rowdy children. Desiring to control the children and at the same time demonstrate his anger to his girlfriend he committed these very significant assaults. 
     
      
    31 It is apparent that the offences were out of character and, particularly having regard to their brutality, difficult to explain. However, in my opinion, a conclusion that alcohol played a part in the applicant’s offending was inevitable. The applicant had an inadequate personality. He was young and immature. In these circumstances his previous good character should have been of assistance to him in the sentencing exercise. Although he committed a sexual assault it was not of the more usual type of repetitive offending against a small child who is unable to report the event, regrettably, often seen in the courts. For this reason in my opinion the sentencing judge should not have concluded that because the offence was one involving sexual intercourse the applicant’s previous good character was of little assistance to him. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant was not contrite 
       
      
    32 Her Honour found that the applicant’s pleas of guilty “demonstrate little by way of contrition.” Her Honour seemed to have reached this conclusion because of her Honour’s finding that the applicant had done little to address his offending behaviour whilst on remand. The applicant’s response to this finding was to emphasise to this Court that, although he ultimately pleaded guilty, his initial plea was not guilty. In these circumstances he could not have been expected to attend programs designed to deal with his offending conduct. Although he accepted that the late plea deprived him of a significant portion of any utilitarian discount it was submitted that it was inappropriate to conclude that he was not contrite by the time he came to be sentenced.  
     
      
    33 In fact the applicant had expressed contrition to the author of the pre-sentence report to whom he said that he felt “worse than terrible” about what he had done. As I understand this remark the applicant accepted full responsibility for his actions. The applicant also expressed remorse to Mr Ashkar, again taking responsibility for his offending behaviour. By the time he was sentenced the applicant had written a letter of apology to the family of the victims and had indicated a desire to do anger management and alcohol courses as well as attend the CUBIT program for sex offenders. 
     
      
    34 In these circumstances, in my opinion, her Honour’s finding that the applicant had done little to demonstrate contrition was inappropriate. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred in finding that the count 2 offence was close to being in the worst class of case. 
       
       
      Ground 5: The sentencing judge erred in finding that the count 2 offence was far more serious than those envisaged as coming within the mid range of objective seriousness. 
       
      
    35 These grounds may also be dealt with together. As the applicant pointed out the act relied upon to found the count 2 offence was the applicant’s digital penetration of the young girl’s vagina so as to cause a posterior fourchette tear and a complete transection of the hymen. The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence and accordingly accepted that what he did, and intended to do, could properly be categorised as “grievous bodily harm.” 
     
      
    36 The sentencing judge found that the offence was “close to being in the worst class of case of its kind.” Her Honour said it fell “at the upper end of the range for like offences. The acts were done with malice, with a complete indifference to human suffering and were done wantonly.” Her Honour found that the offence was “far more serious than those envisaged as coming within the mid range of objective seriousness.” 
     
      
    37 This finding was surprising. The Crown had not submitted that the offence was above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. It was contended that the offence was a “mid-range offence” because of “the age of the child and the number of times the child was struck.” 
     
      
    38 In this Court the applicant submitted that the offence was towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness. Emphasising that her Honour’s findings exclude a sexual motivation in the applicant, it was submitted that the actual grievous bodily harm inflicted, the posterior fourchette tear and the complete transection of the hymen, was of a completely different degree of harm to the kind of harm, meeting the description of grievous bodily harm, which is commonly before the courts. Grievous bodily harm can extend to harm inflicted over a period of time causing permanent brain damage, very serious injury to the body, or a variety of life threatening injuries requiring hospitalisation for months and which may entail long and continuing suffering for the victim. The applicant submitted that the time taken to inflict the harm in this case was short. His counsel emphasised that there was insufficient evidence to make any finding that there would be a long term impact from the assault. 
     
      
    39 The applicant also submitted that the striking of the young girl with the belt did not cause injuries in the nature of grievous bodily harm. Although, as with the boys, harm was inflicted, it was submitted that it was not of a nature which could be described as grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    40 The applicant acknowledged that it is difficult to find comparable cases to the present case when determining an appropriate sentence. In R v Olsen [2005] NSWCCA 243 the offender was found to have caused 57 injuries to his 3½ year old child. He was 29 years old, entered a plea of not guilty, was not contrite, had an extensive criminal record, including assault, for which he had been imprisoned and was on bail at the time for an offence of violence against the child’s mother. The child remained in hospital for 2 weeks. This Court concluded that the sentence imposed by the trial judge of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5½ years was heavy and at the top of the appropriate range. 
     
      
    41 In R v Kotevski (unreported, NSWCCA, 3 April 1998) the offender lost control during an altercation with his wife and repeatedly stabbed her with a number of weapons. A sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months, was imposed. This Court by majority dismissed an appeal. Hulme J would have reduced the sentence to 2 years. 
     
      
    42 In these circumstances the applicant submitted that a sentence comprising a non-parole period of 10 years with a parole period of 5 years was manifestly excessive. It is submitted that when proper regard is had to the applicant’s prior good character, his youth and immaturity, his remorse and contrition and the influence of alcohol in his loss of control, a significantly lesser sentence should have been imposed. 
     
      
    43 In my opinion the applicant’s submissions should be accepted. Although a serious crime, in my view, it could not be classified as a “mid range” offence. Although committed in a drunken rage the lack of premeditation and the extent of injury inflicted did not justify the sentence which her Honour imposed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7: The sentence imposed in respect of count 1 was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    44 Her Honour imposed a fixed term of 8 years in respect of count 1. The applicant emphasised that the sentencing judge concluded that “the objective seriousness of the offence” fell “below the midrange envisaged by the legislature when the standard non-parole period was introduced.” The standard non-parole period is 15 years. A significant finding by her Honour was her conclusion that the offence was not done for any form of sexual gratification. Her Honour made this finding notwithstanding the opinion of Mr Ashkar a clinical psychologist. 
     
      
    45 In these circumstances the applicant submitted that her Honour must have concluded that the objective seriousness of the offence was towards the lower end of the range. It was submitted that this finding was correct having regard to the fact that, although it was an offence committed on a young child, it was an isolated, spontaneous act by an immature youth of prior good character who was significantly under the influence of alcohol. In these circumstances it was submitted that the sentence which her Honour imposed was excessive, and significantly so. 
     
      
    46 The applicant made reference to a number of previous decisions where significantly lesser sentences than that imposed by her Honour were imposed for breaches of s 66A. In R v Dunn unreported, NSWCCA 15 April 1992, where the circumstances were similar to the present case, the Court of Criminal Appeal varied the sentence from 3½ years to 2 years. In R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128 the Court of Criminal Appeal reduced a sentence to 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year in relation to two counts of digital penetration of an 11 year old which did not cause physical damage or injury. R v Allpass (1994) 72 A Crim R 561 involved a 75 year old offender who digitally penetrated a 9 year old girl in breach of trust, causing damage to her hymen and consequent bleeding. In that case a Crown appeal against the imposition of a bond was dismissed, although the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that a more appropriate sentence would have been a period of periodic detention.  
     
      
    47 Each of these matters was determined before standard non-parole periods were provided by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This may diminish their relevance. However, as I later indicate, I am satisfied that the offence fell below the mid range of seriousness and accordingly these decisions do have some significance to the sentencing task in the present case. 
     
      
    48 It is of considerable significance when sentencing for this offence that the sentencing judge found that the applicant was not motivated by a desire for sexual gratification. The Crown did not challenge that finding in this Court. In my view the applicant’s description of the offence (which I have recorded in [45] above) is appropriate. In these circumstances the offence fell significantly below the mid range of seriousness and the sentence her Honour imposed was excessive. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8: The sentencing judge erred in failing to determine a non-parole period for the sentences in respect of counts 3 and 4. 
       
       
      Ground 9: The sentencing judge erred in making the sentences for count 3 wholly cumulative on the sentence for count 4. 
       
       
      Ground 10: The sentencing judge erred in making the sentences for counts 1 and 2 wholly cumulative on the sentence for count 3. 
       
      
    49 In the view I have reached it is unnecessary to deal with these grounds in detail. I am satisfied that error has occurred which requires the applicant to be resentenced. The applicant’s complaint was that the sentencing judge gave no explanation for failing to set a non-parole period in respect of counts 3 and 4: see R v Thomas (1993) 65 A Crim R 269. Complaint is also made that although her Honour indicated that she would have regard to the principles of totality and accepted that the offences were committed in “one course of criminal conduct”, her Honour nevertheless made the sentence for count 3 wholly cumulative on the sentence for count 4. The applicant accepted that to some extent cumulation was required, but given the fact that there were separate victims, submitted that the appropriate course was to provide for partial concurrence: R v Wicks [2005] NSWCCA 409 at [49]. Furthermore, at the sentencing hearing the Crown did not contend that wholly cumulative sentences should be imposed. It is submitted that the end result of the course her Honour took is that the overall sentence was excessive. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the appeal 
       
      
    50 I have already indicated that in my view error has occurred which requires intervention of this Court. It is necessary to form a clear appreciation of the circumstances in which the crimes were committed. 
     
      
    51 The applicant was an immature individual who reluctantly found himself in a position of responsibility in relation to the children. Without question he was seriously affected by alcohol, frustrated by the absence of the mother of the children and was not able to respond appropriately to their misbehaviour. His feelings of frustration turned to rage and in a misguided attempt at discipline he struck the two boys and the girl inflicting pain and causing serious bruising. The harm inflicted on the little girl was of a totally different order to that inflicted on the boys, although her Honour accepted that his actions did not have a sexual motivation. The applicant decided that a physical assault to her vagina was the most appropriate response to her restless behaviour. His purpose was to inflict pain on her. Any right minded person would be seriously affronted by his conduct. 
     
      
    52 However, it is necessary to ensure when sentencing for a particular offence that the penalty imposed reflects the seriousness of the actual crime having regard to the range of objective seriousness which offences of the type may involve. Unless this principle is kept firmly in mind consistency in sentencing cannot be achieved, diminishing public confidence in the criminal justice system.  
     
      
    53 Although by reason of the statutory definition the act of digital penetration of the small girl constituted sexual intercourse, not being motivated by sexual gratification, it has a character quite different to the offence to which the section is directed. 
     
      
    54 To my mind it was important when sentencing the applicant to bear in mind his immaturity and accordingly his inability to deal with the situation with which he was confronted. It is obvious that he must be severely punished by a sentence which makes plain to the community that the serious physical abuse of young children will not be tolerated. Although I am satisfied that the sentences which her Honour imposed were excessive, and significantly so, identifying the appropriate sentences is a complex task. 
     
      
    55 In relation to count 1, the sexual intercourse count, the standard non-parole period is 15 years. I have already indicated my view (at [48]) that, contrary to her Honour’s finding, the offence fell below the mid range of objective seriousness. Not only does the offence fall below the mid range of seriousness but as her Honour found, the offence is subsumed by count 2. 
     
      
    56 There are difficulties in sentencing an offender for a breach of s 33 of the Crimes Act. Although the maximum penalty is 25 years the legislature has provided a standard non-parole period of 7 years. Accordingly, for an offence falling below the mid range, a period of incarceration of less than 7 years will be appropriate. These difficulties were recently commented on by this Court in relation to a different offence in R v Marshall [2007] NSWCCA 24 at [34] ff. 
     
      
    57 I have already indicated that in my opinion the count 2 offence fell below the mid range of seriousness. Although the victim was a young and vulnerable child and the offence gratuitously cruel, no weapon, punch or kick was used. This offence is commonly characterised by far greater violence and the use of a weapon. Furthermore, the physical harm inflicted on the small girl will not occasion permanent injury, as tragically occurs in many cases. The assault was committed on a young girl and is, rightly, likely to initiate emotions of revulsion for the offence and the offender. However, when sentencing a court must endeavour to ensure that the sentence reflects the appropriate application of sentencing principles. 
     
      
    58 After considerable deliberation I have determined that allowing 10% for the applicant’s guilty plea for count 2, a non-parole period of 4½ years with a further term of 3 years is the appropriate sentence. There may be some who consider this to be a lenient sentence. However, the sentence which is imposed must reflect the statutory penalty and standard non-parole period to which I have referred. While proper consideration must be given to the vulnerability of the victims it must also reflect the applicant’s youth and the circumstances of the offence, including the extent of the injuries inflicted to which I have already referred. 
     
      
    59 The sentences imposed should provide an identifiable penalty for each of the assaults. In my opinion having regard to the problems I have identified in her Honour’s approach to sentencing the applicant, a modest reduction of those sentences is also appropriate. However, I would allow only partial accumulation of these sentences. Because of the applicant’s need for careful supervision so that he may effectively re-establish himself in the community as a mature adult, in my view, a finding of special circumstances is also appropriate. 
     
      
    60 In the circumstances of this case because, in my opinion, the applicant must receive a separate sentence for count 2 which extends beyond any parole period which may have been appropriate for counts 1, 3 and 4, I do not believe that a non-parole period for these offences is necessary. 
     
      
    61 The sentences I propose are: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: fixed term of 4 years imprisonment commencing on 3 March 2006 and expiring on 2 March 2010. 
       
       
      Count 2: a non-parole period of 4½ years commencing on 3 March 2006 and expiring on 2 September 2010 with a parole period of 3 years expiring on 2 September 2013. 
       
       
      Count 3: fixed term of six months commencing on 3 September 2005 and expiring on 2 March 2006. 
       
       
      Count 4: fixed term of six months commencing on 3 December 2005 and expiring on 2 June 2006. 
       
      
    62 Accordingly, the total term without parole will be a period of 5 years with a further period of 3 years on parole. 
     
      
    63 SULLY J: I agree with the orders of McClellan CJ at CL and I agree generally with his Honour’s expressed reasons for those orders. 
     
      
    64 I have had the advantage of seeing in draft the brief and separate reasons of Howie J. I agree completely with the additional observations made by his Honour. 
     
      
    65 HOWIE J: I have received the considerable benefit of reading the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in draft. I agree with the orders he proposes for the reasons he gives. I merely wish to make some brief comments about the finding made by English DCJ that the offence involving the digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina was not a sexually motivated offence. 
     
      
    66 As the Chief Judge has pointed out, this Court was not asked by the Crown to revisit that finding of fact. Yet it was a crucial finding in sentencing for the offences in both counts 1 and 2. Arguably the finding was unreasonable. On its face the act of the accused was sexually motivated even if that motivation was not the principal reason for what he did. I find it difficult to believe that the digital penetration of a child of such young years would be the means taken of hurting the child if that was all that the applicant wanted to do and even in his intoxicated state. 
     
      
    67 The psychiatrist, an expert, believed that, notwithstanding the applicant’s denial, the act was sexually motivated. Yet the Judge preferred to accept the bald assertion of the applicant that he had no sexual motivation even though he did not give evidence before her. This Court has frequently indicated the caution with which a sentencing judge should accept statements attributed to offenders in mitigation or explanation for an offence contained in reports and where the offender did not give evidence: see for example R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174. In any event it is easy to understand why a young man would later deny any sexual motivation for such an act by way of self-denial or from reasons of embarrassment. 
     
      
    68 In my view any person hearing of the act of the applicant and the injury inflicted upon the child would find it almost impossible to comprehend that conduct without thinking of it as a sexual assault upon the child of very grave seriousness. And yet once the finding of the Judge was made it is difficult to understand why there were two offences charged concerning the injury inflicted upon the child. If the act of digital penetration of the child was not sexually motivated, then that act is reduced to the means by which the grievous bodily harm was inflicted. It is very rare indeed for the Crown to charge as an offence both the act inflicting the grievous bodily harm as well as the infliction of the harm. That is because the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm comprehends, at least for the purposes of sentence, the means by which the harm was inflicted. To take an absurd example, if a person struck another with a machete lopping of the other’s arm, it is inconceivable that the Crown would charge the offender with both the infliction of grievous bodily harm and an assault. 
     
      
    69 The only reason for charging both the sexual assault offence and the infliction of grievous bodily harm was because the Crown was asserting that there were two offences committed of a completely different nature arising from the same act, both of which needed to be separately punished: a sexual assault and the infliction of grievous bodily harm. Once the sexual content of the count 1 offence evaporated, the applicant was being doubly punished for the same act: see Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. This is why there must be concurrent sentences for counts 1 and 2. 
     
      
    70 I cannot help but think that, notwithstanding the finding of no sexual motivation, the Judge could not completely dispel this connotation from her mind when sentencing for the grievous bodily harm offence otherwise it is impossible to see how her Honour could have been so wrong in determining the gravity of that offence as against the standard non-parole period. In my opinion the sentence proposed by the Chief Judge is significantly less than the sentence that ought to have been imposed if the Judge had not found that the offence in count 1 was not sexually motivated.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: On 24 May 2006, Lisa Joy Beattie was committed for trial upon two charges. On 30 August 2006 his Honour Judge Robison found her unfit to stand trial. In accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, he referred the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.2 For some reason that I need not explore, the tribunal only received the referral on 1 November 2006.3 On 8 December 2006 it determined, on the balance of probabilities that Ms Beattie would not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness become fit to be tried upon the two charges. That determination requires this Court to conduct a Special Hearing of the charges upon which Miss Beattie has been committed for trial last May.4 I have satisfied myself the charges upon which she was unfit to be tried are the charges before the Court. These charges are  (1) that on 21 January 2006 at Bankstown in the State of New South Wales, she maliciously wounded Aminah Hamdoun with intent to do grievous bodily harm. (2) In the alternative she is charged that at the same time and place, she maliciously wounded Aminah Hamdoun5 I remind myself a special hearing is for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the accused, that she is acquitted unless it can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, on the limited evidence available, that she has committed one or other of these charges.6 This special hearing is to be conducted as near as possible to a criminal trial.7 I record that at the hearing Miss Beattie was represented by Mr Leary, solicitor, advocate of the Legal Aid Commission. 8 At the outset of these proceedings she was arraigned and pleas of not guilty were entered on her account. That was done by me so that the accused, hopefully, would understand that she is to be taken as pleading “Not guilty” in respect of each charge.9 I record that I was aware the accused was unfit to be tried in accordance with normal procedures, the meaning of her being unfit, the purpose of the special hearing and the verdict available.10 In theory there are three available verdicts to the charge I am considering: “Not guilty” of the charge; a special verdict, not guilty by reason of mental illness; and finally on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged.11 However, in the event that the Crown proved the relevant central elements of one or other of the charged offences in the circumstances of this case, there is no available evidence to support a special verdict.12 I record that from my experience formally as an advocate and now as a Judge, that I am aware of the consequence of each available verdict and the practical consequences of these verdicts. See Subramaniam v The Queen (2004) 79 ALJR 116. This hearing was conducted before a Judge sitting without a jury as provided by s 21A of the Mental Health Criminal Procedure Act, 1990.13 As presiding Judge I am tasked with finding facts ultimately leading to a determination of a verdict or verdicts as the case may be.14 To the facts as I find them to be I must apply the relevant principles of law; the principles of law I would normally direct a jury upon. I remind myself now of those relevant principles.15 The appropriate starting point is to recognise the “Not guilty” plea as entered on behalf of the accused. She is entitled to be considered not guilty unless and until, if it be case, the Crown proves her guilt on one or other of the charges. That is to say the onus of proving the guilt of the accused rests with the Crown.16 The standard of proof required is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.17 I remind myself of the first charge, having the following elements 
     
     On 21 January, 2006 at Bankstown, the accused maliciously wounded Aminah Hambdoun;. 
     At the time she did so with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 
    18 Each of these elements must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 19 The alternate charge will be proved if the Crown succeeds in proving the first element but fails to prove the second element. I remind myself suspicion is no substitute for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.20 I remind myself that “malicious”, for the purpose of this trial means the accused’s acts were deliberate, unlawful and intended acts. The Crown does not have to prove the accused intended the actual stab wound or other injuries occasioned. Indeed, I am satisfied they probably were not intended. These particular wounds are defence wounds resulting from the complainant’s defensive response the stabbing motions made by the accused. 21 I also need to be satisfied, for purpose only of the first element, that the accused intended some injuries. Put another way, the injury occasioned was not an accident, but a consequence of a willed and deliberate unlawful act by the accused, although not necessarily with the intent of causing the injury occasioned.22 I remind myself that to prove the complainant was wounded, the Crown must prove some cutting, breaking or penetration of the interior layers of skin. The stab wound, as sustained by the complainant would qualify as a wound. 23 I remind myself that grievous bodily harm in modern times is equated to “Really serious injury”. “Really”, means “in truth” or “in reality”. It does not mean “Very”.24 Findings of fact are for me to make. I remind myself in making findings of fact I may accept all, part or none of what a witness says. There are some criteria of value in assessing a witness’s testimony. They include observing the demeanour of the witness; the attitude of the witness; the way he or she answers questions; whether the witness was frank or attempting some avoidance or obfuscation.25 Inconsistency in evidence, whether internal or external, may be indicative as of unreliability. Of course there may be other explanations for inconsistencies, such as a failure to understand a question or articulate the intended answer accurately.26 Where there is supporting evidence I may more readily accept the witness. Where evidence is uncontested by cross-examination, as in this case most of it was, I may more readily rely upon in. However, before I do so, in a Special Hearing, I need to remind myself that the absence of cross-examination may be caused by the very fact that the accused is unfit to be tried, and has unable to instruct her counsel.27 In approaching this case I must remember my oath to Judge without fear or favour, affection or ill will. That means in this case I must be impartial. I remind myself to confine my findings to the sworn evidence, exhibits and conclusions of fact open on the received evidence. I remind myself that such conclusions of fact that I would draw from the direct evidence must be justifiable conclusions. I must avoid speculation. I remind myself to draw adverse conclusions of fact against the accused only in circumstances where the conclusion of fact I contemplate drawing is the only rational conclusion open on the evidence.28 Where more than one conclusion of fact is available to draw one or the other would be speculating. Nor can I draw a conclusion of fact where there is no evidential foundation for it at all.29 The accused has not given evidence. At the outset of the special hearings I entered pleas of not guilty on her behalf. She may have given evidence. She may choose not to give evidence. It is a free choice that she has. That means there is no forensic disadvantage for her choosing not to give evidence. Her pleas of “Not guilty” entitle her to be presumed innocent until, should the Crown do so, it proves her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. She has the right of silence, that is not some empty mantra. Her decision to remain silent does not advance the Crown case one iota. It does not become some makeweight for the Crown case. It is not some admission against her interest; does not amount to some inference that she is or may be guilty of either offence.30 I am required to review the existing limited evidence at the close of the Crown case to see if, upon that evidence, the Crown has proved the commission of the offence by the accused on either charge.31 I viewed the ERISP in which the accused participated. I remind myself her participation in that record of interview does not shift the burden of proof. The accused has not raised her good character. From my knowledge and experience I am able to infer she may well have reasons relating adversely to her character not to do so. I must put to one side any bias or reasoning that relies upon a presumption of bad character as I assessed the evidence. The Review of the Evidence. 32 Very little of the evidence was contested. There was some inconsistency, as one might expect, as to finer details as between the witnesses, but a clear picture on the essential elements has emerged. Aminah Hambdoun presented in Court and in exhibit D as a young lady who identifies as a Muslim. She wore to Court, and was wearing on 21 January 2006, items of clothing associated with Muslim women, including a blue hijab, long sleeve white top, black slacks and a pinafore.33 I apologise if there be any cultural inappropriateness in describing her outer garment as a pinafore.34 She was at the Bankstown Centro with her family at about midday on 21 January 2006. The male members of the family had separated and the complainant and her mother made their way to Hollywood Shoes. That shop occupied a corner position in the mall. Across a large exit corridor was a Supre clothing shop. Situate in the middle of the corridor was Boost Juice. Mother and daughter separated. The daughter to buy something from Boost Juice. The mother to shop at Hollywood Shoes. 35 The complainant was paying for her purchase, a juice of some kind. She noticed the trainee shop assistant looking past her. The complainant turned around to see what she was looking at. The accused was behind her with a knife, slightly raised above her head ready to plunge it into the complainant. I am satisfied the accused did not anticipate the complainant would see her or turn to face her. I am satisfied in so doing the complainant prevented the accused stabbing her at that moment.36 Other evidence I accept establishes that moments before the complainant turned, the accused had entered Bankstown Centro from the Appin Way, through what I shall call the JB Hi-Fi entrance. That entrance flowed into the corridor leading to Boost Juice. I am satisfied the complainant was the first person the accused spotted wearing Muslim apparel who was still, and was unaware of the accused or her intentions. I am satisfied the accused was looking for some person wearing Muslim apparel and not specifically targeting the complainant. What she was specifically targeting was someone who was Muslim. 37 The evidence on which I rely to make the above finding is to be found in exhibit E, the ERISP. In that record of interview the accused agreed that she had earlier said that she had stabbed a woman at Bankstown, that her motive for doing so was that she wanted to stab a Muslim. She told the police she had had enough of Muslims. She was related to a Muslim and she hated them.38 There is nothing that persuades me one way or the other as to whether she is related to a Muslim, or had had enough of Muslims. I am satisfied that there is some evidence suggesting that she had, at about the time of the offence, some problems with Muslims, at least in her mind and attitude.39 Ivo Cardoso, a supervisor of trainees with Boost Juices, was observing his trainee shop assistant, Mary, serving the complainant a juice. He saw the accused make her way down the corridor and make her way directly to the complainant. When the complainant first turned she noticed the tarnished knife with a 10 centimetre blade raised in the accused’s clenched fist. The knife was at least level with the accused’s forehead and probably a fraction higher. 40 As the complainant turned to face her attacker, she noticed the accused seemed angry and very determined. The complainant’s sense was the accused was focused and determined on harming her. The complainant ran or walked quickly towards her mother in the Hollywood Shoe shop. It was a distance of five to six metres or some 10 to 15 steps. 41 As she neared the shoe shop, the complainant turned again. The accused had followed her and was, to use the words of the complainant, in her “personal space”. She was still armed with the knife. The complainant said, “What’s wrong, are you okay?” The accused thrust the knife at the complainant. The complainant put her right hand up, arm facing outwards, fingers extended like a policeman on point duty halting motor traffic. It was a reflex defensive response. The accused was thrusting the knife towards her. 42 I am satisfied the question asked by the complainant caused the accused to hesitate, although only for a moment. I do not regard her actual physical thrusting movement with the knife as hesitant. The hesitation that was described by the complainant, was a hesitation caused by response; by a moments thought as to whether to respond to the question. The accused decided not to answer it orally but to strike with the knife instead. 43 In so doing she injured the complainant’s middle finger from the fingernail cuticle to the first joint with a laceration, then the base of the middle finger with a smaller laceration and finally the base of the index finger with a small cut. That cut may well have been caused by the complainant’s hand gripping the blade. None of the injuries from this strike were serious. 44 Another downward stabbing motion followed. The complainant had a shopping bag and her personal handbag in her left hand. She raised her left arm with elbow bent in a reflex, defensive action. As the knife came down, it penetrated through the upper surface of the left forearm, some five or six inches above the wrist and emerged on the inside surface of the forearm again, some five or so inches from the wrist. 45 As exhibited at Court, the area of the penetrating wound has now healed. But there is scarring at the entry opening, and surgical scarring from that to the underside of the arm. The knife, as it travelled through the arm, severed muscle and tendons. The area severed was the abductor policis longus which controls actions of the thumb and is one of the tendons related to extending and abducting the wrist.46 As I earlier remarked I am satisfied that this injury was not intended. It is a serious injury, although, whether it qualified as grievous bodily harm is moot, but not a matter I need to determine. If it did so qualify it would be more because of the scarring, perhaps, than the penetration. When she received the major injury, the victim screamed. 47 The accused hurriedly departed the scene and fled from Centro through the entrance she had come. 48 Later, the knife was thrown away, most probably by the complainant’s boyfriend.49 The complainant’s evidence, which is unchallenged, is that both stabbing actions of the accused were aimed at her chest.50 For the purpose of assessing the accused’s intent, it is also important to remember she had the knife, it was raised when the complainant was at Boost Juice. Had the complainant not turned, I am satisfied the knife was aimed towards the complainant’s rear, although which specific part I cannot tell. The knife was above the complainant’s shoulder in height. Her shoulders, the nape of her neck and her upper back were all within the target area. That area houses the lungs, heart and several vital arteries. Any injury to that area was likely to compromise one or other of those organs or vessels. Until the complainant turned, all that area was vulnerable and undefended.51 I am satisfied the accused has mental health issues. During the ERISP she had, and clearly needed, a support person. During her interview she was frequently seriously, emotionally distressed. Indeed, the interviewing officer recognised that and terminated the interview before completing her investigative questioning.52 Although the accused, at the time of the arrest, confirmed she had earlier admitted stabbing the complainant in the interview her position was that those admissions were not true in fact. 53 Whilst police were outside the interview room, looking for the officer in charge of the station to come and ask the usual post-interview questions, the complainant conducted an emotional conversation with her support person. In the course of this conversations she said, “I can’t believe James would tell me to do something like this. To stab a beautiful woman...why? Why would want (sic) to stab a person at all - because this guy James, in the first place, going with him, I didn’t know and I was that scared ‘cos he had a knife, he was going to pull it on me and everything”. The only male identified as the accused “Boyfriend”, is a man named Gary. 54 The evidence is silent as to who James is - and whether he exists in reality or only in the accused’s mind. However, what appears as inevitable from this conversation is that the act of stabbing was willed by the complainant, whether, as a consequence of being instructed so to do or on her own account. The reasoning causing the willed act is obscure. 55 That evidence, taken with earlier admissions, her act in coming armed with a knife, her three actions in raising a knife as though to stab and doing so on two occasions, satisfies me the accused clearly intended to stab the complainant. Further I am satisfied she intended to stab the complainant with sufficient force to penetrate through the skin into the red flesh of her victim. The facts that her hand was raised three times, first to areas of the upper back and nape of the neck and aimed then two times at the chest, satisfies me the accused was determined to injure the complainant.56 The complainant describes the accused’s demeanour as angry and determined. The knife is described as having a 10 centimetre blade. The stealth of the thwarted attack from the rear, in circumstances where the complainant was angry and determined and had the knife raised above her forehead, satisfies me the accused intended that the knife should penetrate through at least most of the blade length, that is through the complainant’s skin to a depth of at least most of the blade length. 57 I am satisfied she retained that intention when she stabbed the complainant on the two other occasions. In those circumstances I am satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused intended to inflict grievous bodily harm or really serious injury. 58 Thus, returning to the essential elements of the first offence, I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused wounded the complainant. I am satisfied when she did so she was acting maliciously, that is deliberately. I am satisfied that when she did so she was intending to cause really serious injury to the complainant. I am satisfied these events occurred at Bankstown on 21 January 2006. That being so, I am satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, on the limited evidence before the court, that the Crown has proved the first charge in the indictment. 59 I do not need to consider the alternate charge.60 The formal verdict that I enter is that on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the charge contained in first count in the indictment.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: At about 8pm on Thursday 25 August 2005 Nguyen Phan boarded a city-bound train from Punchbowl. The carriage he entered had two female passengers in the upper level. The complainant settled himself into one of the seats on his own. The two female passengers left the train either at Campsie or Canterbury. The complainant was alone in what I accept was a well lit carriage, making his way to the city or to some stop before the city.2 Shortly after the train left Hurlstone Park, Sitiveni Ligaviu, Mossisi Ramaketa, Nathaniel Nakui, Nikita Lewis and two other males entered the area where Phan was seated. One male walked past him and positioned himself behind Phan. That person was Ramaketa. Seconds later Phan was punched to the right eye and the right side of his head. Ramaketa delivered these blows. Other males joined in, surrounding the victim. He was hit in the ribs. 3 Frightened in the extreme, he removed a black Nokia 8130 mobile telephone from his jacket. He attempted to call for help. The phone was plucked from his had by one of the robbers. Another began to search his pocket. Fearing further assault, Phan surrendered his wallet to one of the robbers. Credit cards and $800 were surrendered with the wallet.4 One of the persons involved in the robbery whilst in the company of the others was Sitiveni Ligaviu. At his arraignment on 20 November 2006 he pleaded guilty to that offence. Today he is to be held accountable for it and for his criminal conduct in participating with others in the robbery of Nguyen Phan.5 As the train pulled into Dulwich station, the next station after the robbery was completed, the six robbers alighted from the train. As they did so, one yelled to the victim, “You stay there”. All six then sprinted off from the station. The victim left the train at Marrickville and immediately reported the robbery to the stationmaster there.6 As sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this court committed by this offender harming this victim in this community. See Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 at [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires me to make findings of fact, or in this case, further findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to both the offence and to the offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will need to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. 7 Before any sentence can be made, there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, totality, parity, the length of the non-parole period and finally, of course, the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment to be imposed. None of these things can be done until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. See R v Cuthbert (1967) 86 WN (NSW) Pt 1 272, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Additional Facts. 8 The offender claims in sworn evidence he was not one of the robbers who physically attacked the victim. He says he stayed on the stairs to call out if someone came. He claims he had not been told anything by Ramaketa. I am satisfied he well knew he was on the train for the purpose of robbing some unknown passenger. I am satisfied he well knew that the robbing of a passenger may well require some physical violence. I am satisfied he agreed to be party to the unlawful taking of money by the group on the train that he was a member of. I am satisfied he received some of the proceeds of that robbery because he was a member of the group; that is, he was one of the robbers, and not for any other reason. 9 I accept that one of the robbers was tasked with guarding the stairs, for two reasons: to warn in the event of anyone, particularly rail security, coming in the direction of the robbers. I am also satisfied the purpose of placing a robber on the stairs was to block an escape route the victim might try to use.  10 I did not find Sitiveni Ligaviu an impressive witness. He claims he was the one assigned to the stairs. I regard that claim as probably self-serving. In any event, the role he claims was an important role in the robbery. In that role he made more secure the robbers’ chances of success without detection. Nor do I accept his share of the proceeds of the robbery was limited to $50. That may not matter much because I am satisfied most, if not all, of the proceeds was spent on alcohol and probably drugs in which all members of the group shared. I am satisfied the motive for the robbery was to obtain money for that purpose. 11 I sentenced Ramaketa on 2 June 2006. In my remarks on that occasion I described him as the leader of the group. There is nothing I have read in the facts of this case that causes me to change that finding in this case.Objective Criminality. 12 I repeat my assessment of the objective criminality that I set out in Ramaketa’s case when I said,  
     
      
      “I turn now to the objective criminality. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the [offence] as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour undertaken by this offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant offence with the criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in that way that the seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality of an offence obviously has an important impact on the overall sentence to be imposed. 
      
     
     
      
      A useful starting point in assessing the objective criminality of robbery is to remind myself of the remarks of the Chief Justice Gleeson when Chief Justice of New South Wales. His remarks encapsulate the essence of the legal wrong done by robbers and the reason why a substantial punishment is required. Chief Justice Gleeson said,  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ‘One of the primary purposes of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace. In this connection the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and to go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence. It also embraces respect for the property of others. Offences of the kind committed by the present [offender] are not trivial instances of disrespect for private property. They are direct attacks upon the security of the person and the property which the law exists to protect.’  
        R v Rause 
         unreported, NSWCCA 8 August 1992. 
        
       
      
     The essence of robbery is the use of force to overcome the will of the victim to such an extent that he surrenders to the robbers goods and money he would not otherwise have given up. The force charged here is the use of numbers, that is, more than one person so that the victim is outnumbered. Indeed, in this case the number of the robbers was equivalent to a rugby league scrum. Robbery in company is accomplished when two or more persons commit a robbery. 13 This robbery targeted a citizen travelling on public transport in circumstances where that person was outnumbered, isolated, with escape routes blocked by his attackers and the robber who manned the stairs. It occurred between stations whereby the victim’s isolation became the greater. Even if he successfully fled the robbers on the train, he could not flee the train and complete his escape. Further, the prospects of discovery and detection are greater at stations where CCTV cameras are operating or when potential victims are alighting or entering into the carriage. The demand that the victim remain in the carriage was to increase the robbers’ prospects of escape and avoiding detection. 14 The victim, being alone and so significantly outnumbered, was vulnerable to these robbers. The two robbers I have seen are both powerfully built young men. Each has told me he is interested in furthering his football career to representative level. Each has a physique that would permit or accommodate such an ambition. Their presence as part of that group of robbers would have added to the feeling of despair, vulnerability and fear their victim felt.15 The robbery was planned. While it may well be that the robbers hoped for someone who would be drunk or drugged so he could be ‘rolled’ without much violence, the fact is Mr Phan was selected as an appropriate target. This offender, if he be the one that stayed at the stairs, knew to do so as his cohorts approached the victim. The selection of the victim, the striking of him between stations, the alighting at the stop immediately following the robbery, and the presence of all six robbers satisfies me it was a planned event. When the plan was hatched, I am unable to say. But I am satisfied that by the time they joined the train, at that time, the plan had been hatched and the joining of the train was putting that plan into operation.”16 Quite clearly, on its objective facts, this is an offence requiring significant imprisonment for those who participated in it. 17 I have had regard to matters of aggravation enumerated in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have sought to deal with all matters of aggravation by relying upon the common law and the relevant factors of aggravation recognised by it in assessing the objective criminality. This is not a case where I would regard factors of aggravation being so prominent as to require them to be considered anew by reliance upon the statutory provisions contained in s 21A.Subjective matters. 18 I turn now to the subjective matters. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence before the Court, but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to this offender may offer the Court some explanation and insight into his commission of these offences and some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.Family dynamics and social background. 19 Sitiveni Ligaviu, born in June of 1987, is not yet twenty years old. At the time of the offence he was aged eighteen years and two months. His family migrated to Australia from Fiji in 1989. At that time he was two years old. He is the eldest of three boys; the others are aged sixteen and five. His parents and a substantial portion of his extended family live in Sydney. There appear to be no issues arising out of his upbringing; his family is reported as being a happy, supportive one. He practised as a Seventh Day Adventist. Religion was an important component of their family life. His parents both hold down employed positions. His family has remained supportive throughout his incarceration. He has maintained regular contact with them in visits and via phone. His parents have been in attendance when the matter has been before me. His post release plans, apparently supported by his parents, are to return to his family home.Education/employment history and other skills. 20 At the time of his arrest he was still, at least, notionally attending Belmore High School. His attendance in the senior years had declined, leading to a deterioration in his academic achievements. Truanting had become regular. That led to him associating with a peer group whose influence on him was negative. That in turn led to him becoming in greater conflict with the law. He would seem to have worked as a storeman and packer at Bellway for three to four days a week for a period packing soap and noodles. That provided him with an income stream of about $400 weekly. 21 His major skill is as a rugby league footballer. He hopes to achieve professional status. He has played junior representative football with St George. He has the physique and skills to play at a professional level, but appears to be doing all he can to ruin his prospects of playing in the senior ranks as a professional sportsman. He has engaged in antisocial, criminal behaviour. He has abused drugs. He has involved himself in binge drinking. Upon his release he will soon learn that First Division football clubs will be reluctant to sign on anyone, however skilled, who is likely to bring their club into disrepute.22 He has told Probation and Parole he would like to complete the Higher School Certificate through TAFE. During custody he has obtained his green card and occupational health and safety certificate. They are both useful qualifications in the construction industry.General health. 23 I have already commented upon his physical appearance. There is every reason to believe he is, as a twenty year old, in excellent physical health.Mental health. 24 I have no evidence before me to suggest there are any significant mental health issues.Drug and alcohol issues.25 I am satisfied there are serious alcohol issues. He conceded he is a binge drinker, particularly after football matches. He has also abused cannabis. The pre-sentence reports he has minimal insight into his alcohol and cannabis use, or it should really be abuse. He does not consider he has a problem with them. He is wrong. 26 On his own account he had been drinking when he committed this offence. That clearly establishes he has a problem with alcohol. It led him into antisocial behaviour on this occasion and quite probably on others (I am referring to matters in his criminal record). Although he enrolled in a drug and alcohol course whilst in custody, he has yet to start it. Attitude to offence. 27 Sitiveni Ligaviu gave evidence that he felt sorry for the victim of his offending conduct. The pre-sentence reports him as lacking insight into his offending, minimising his role in the event. He does not accept responsibility. His evidence can be tested by subsequent entries on his criminal record. 28 In November 2005 he used an offensive weapon to commit an indictable offence. In June 2006, he drove a conveyance without the consent of its owner. I am satisfied he recognises his offending conduct has placed him in gaol. He finds that situation hard, uncomfortable and probably confronting. There is a sadness he is experiencing that his offending conduct has seen him lose his liberty. That is to say, his contrition is more about the consequences to him than it is about the consequences to his victim. It is unlikely he understands the post-traumatic aftermath victims experience for weeks and sometimes longer after a trauma of robbery having the violence of this robbery.Character and criminal antecedents. 29 This offender is but nineteen years old. His character is still forming. To date, the negatives seem to outweigh the positives. He has lacked commitment to schooling, he is doing all he can to ruin his prospects for football career, he has little work history and no great work skills. He appears to be self-centred and immature. He does however, have great potential. He is capable of further study and claims to be interested in doing his higher school certificate. He has elite level skills at football provided he does not undermine them with drug and alcohol abuse and associated antisocial behaviour.30 Regrettably, his criminal antecedents suggest he has been out of control since this 2005 offence. This offence represents his first criminal offending. However, since then he has used an offensive weapon to commit an indictable offence. He has possessed implements to enter a conveyance and taken a conveyance without the consent of its owner. He has been found guilty of larceny and has failed to appear in accordance with his bail undertakings, for which he was sentenced to the rising of the Court. 31 While none of these matters aggravate the criminal conduct with which I am dealing, they do present a worry in assessing his claimed contrition for his offending. They are also of concern when assessing, as I must do, his rehabilitation prospects. Guilty plea. 32 This offender has pleaded guilty at arraignment. He was committed for trial on this charge on 14 August 2006. That is, a year after the offence and seven months after his arrest. The delay would, in part, appear to be because of his failure to appear at the Local Court on 24 April 2006. That failure to appear is important when assessing the utilitarian value of his plea. I have determined to permit a fifteen per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea.Rehabilitation. 33 It is to be remembered that this offender had just turned eighteen at the time of offending. Rehabilitation is always an important factor to be considered in case where youth is a feature. The sentence should, where other legal principles permit, seek to give emphasis to rehabilitation. Frequently that can be done by structuring the sentence so that there is a greater proportion of the sentence served in the community, see The Queen v Pham per Hunt. I think it is AJA at that stage.  34 An assessment of this offender’s rehabilitation prospects suggest serious oversight of him will be required once he is released from custody. Positive factors include the following: 
     
     A strong family support including practical support such as post-release accommodation. 
     Reasonable prospects of employment, hopefully through the father’s assistance. 
     Excellent general health and the absence of mental health issues. 
     Elite football skills that potentially can be harnessed at professional level, otherwise they can be harnessed as a bases of healthy community social contact and a source of improved self-image. 
     Useful supportive contacts with the pastor of Hillsong church at Waterloo. Hopefully that can be harnessed into supporting and mentoring the offender, particularly during his post-release period. 
     Custody, some progress made whilst in custody, the green card, the Occupational Health and Safety Certificate, the pre-sentence reports that he has worked well in the metal shop and done a computer course of some kind.  
     35 However, there are serious warning signs that will need to be addressed, again, particularly in the community. 
     
     Recent post-offence criminal history suggests antisocial conduct issues arise probably after the consumption of alcohol and/or drugs (cannabis). There is a myth about, that cannabis is a soft drug. Cannabis is a drug that is very closely associated with aggression and paranoia. 
     Recent real problems with alcohol, binge drinking and cannabis consumption. 
     A weak employment record and poor commitment to education in the recent past suggests a lack of commitment to those areas.  
     The offender lacks insight in the seriousness of the offence he participated in. He also lacks insight into the seriousness of his role in that offence, whatever it was. He also lacks insight into the seriousness of his alcohol and probably his drug abuse problem. 
    Setting the sentence. 36 This is an offence, not withstanding the youth of the offender, that calls for general deterrence. That is because, in this case, robberies of this kind are seen as adult offences rather than the misdemeanours associated with children. 37 In modern Australian society, there is a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by the federal and state parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by parliaments, is to deter the citizens of the state from committing criminal offences. Parliament does that by prescribing maximum penalties for those who engage in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. For example, the maximum penalty for this offence is twenty years imprisonment. Consequently when an offender is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, he or she is exposed to the possible maximum penalty provided for by the statute breached. 38 Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires the sentencing judge, when fixing an appropriate sentencing disposition, to keep in mind those maximum penalties for the purpose of general deterrence aimed at the community at large. There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals likeminded to the offender, in particular, I have in mind the two offenders who have not yet been caught, who but for such deterrence, would be willing to commit such crimes in the community. Finally, there is a component of deterrence to be considered personal to this offender, with a view to deterring him or her for from re-offending. 39 This offender has now spent nearly ten months, I think it is, in custody. He will have more to spend. He has heard his conduct denounced by a judicial officer of this Court. He has been before the Local Court for committal. He has been charged at the police station. He has, or must be, aware of the concern or shame that he has brought to his family. In my view, all of that, coupled with the sentence that I am about to impose, is sufficient personal deterrence for him, parity. Parity.40 Parity means comparing the sentence this offender gets by comparison with the sentence given to others in the group that offended with him. Ramaketa’s was sentenced for three robberies. For each he was sentenced to a non-parole period of fifteen months and a balance of term of twelve months, making an overall sentence of two years three months. The starting point for each of those sentences had been three years. That three year starting point had been discounted by twenty-five in his case. 41 I was more impressed with Ramaketa’s subjective features than I am with the present offender’s. He pleaded from the outset. I have assessed his rehabilitation prospects as better than this offender’s. While he was older, he was still young enough for rehabilitation to be an appropriate focus. 42 On the other hand this offender is, as I understand it, three years younger, is involved in only one robbery in company, although objectively, it was the worst of them. This offender lacks insight into his offending conduct and his alcohol abuse issues. His discount for the plea is only fifteen per cent. 43 The other offenders were juveniles sentenced by the Children’s Court. That jurisdiction has a substantially different focus to sentencing than does this Court when dealing with adults. Consequently, sentences for children do not have the severity that can be expected in the adult court. 44 Lovelock v The Queen (1978) 33 FLR 132 and other cases establish that subjective matters and respective roles in offences, can lead to variation in sentence. Before I move from the juveniles, I should note that one was given twelve months supervision without conviction, the other was given twelve months probation without conviction. A compensation order was made against the second one, that is Lewis, in the sum of $800. 45 The parity principle demands the starting point for this offender should be something less than three years overall. For reasons I have given, the parity issue thereafter, must play less weight. Impact of the guideline judgment. 46 Two guideline judgments play a part in this sentencing discretion. R v Thompson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 (17 August 2000) in respect of the guilty plea and R v Henry 106 A Crim R. 149 in respect of the actual offence for which this offender stands to be sentenced. Guideline judgments play an important part in ensuring consistency in sentencing. They also clarify and enumerate the relevant principles of sentencing that may impact upon the sentencing discretion. I am familiar with both guideline judgments and to the benchmark, or the guideline if you like, that was set in Henry. Special circumstances. 47 This is a case in which it is appropriate to find special circumstances. That means that in this case, it will be appropriate to give a longer than what is called normal, parole period by comparison with the rest of the sentence. My reasons for so finding include: 
     
     Youth of the offender and the need for emphasis on rehabilitation. 
     Importance of personal deterrence. 
     This is the offender’s first time in custody. 
     The issue of a partly concurrent sentence of six months all up for unrelated matters. 
    Custody. 48 Ligaviu was refused bail on 27 June 2006. He was sentenced as I say, for unrelated matters to a total of twelve months imprisonment with a six month non-parole period. Those sentences were to date from 26 June 2006. My understanding is that the non-parole period expired on 25 December 2006 and the balance of term on 26 June 2007. Totality. 49 I need to consider giving effect to totality for the sentence that I am about to impose and the sentences this offender is currently serving. That is, the sentences imposed at the Burwood Local Court on 24 July this year. I intend to make this sentence partly concurrent and partly cumulative with his present sentence. The sentence I impose will commence on 26 September 2006. But for the plea of guilty, I would have sentenced this offender to an overall sentence of two years and six months. I have discounted that figure by four and a half months, that is, the fifteen per cent. The net overall sentence therefore is one of two years and one and one half months. Would you stand up please.50 Sitiveni Ligaviu, I convict you of the offence that you on 25 August 2005 at Hurlstone Park when you, being in company with others, robbed Nguyen Phan of a wallet with a sum of money and cards and a mobile phone, all of which were his property.51 I sentence you to a non-parole period of twelve months to commence on 26 September 2006 and to expire on 25 September this year. I find special circumstances as I said. 52 I set a balance of term of thirteen and one half months to expire, on my calculation, on 9 November 2008.53 I order your release to parole on 25 September next. 54 Pursuant to section 51 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I impose the following parole conditions: That you will accept supervision by Probation and Parole. You will obey all reasonable directions of your case manager with Probation and Parole. You will abstain entirely from the consumption of alcohol for the first six months of your parole period. That is to say, any consumption of alcohol for any reason, say Christmas Day, in your first six months will be a breach of your parole and could see you back in custody. Do you understand that? You will submit to random drugs tests at least three times monthly for the first six months of your parole. Any dirty tests, any failure to participate in a test, will be deemed a breach of your parole and is to be brought to the attention of the Parole Board. That is not me, it is somebody else, with my recommendation that they breach you for it. You are to attend treatment and counselling programs as required by Probation and Parole including drug and alcohol, alcohol minimisation, that means learning to drink slowly and not much and drug relapse prevention. You are to do all you can to obtain and maintain full time employment and incidentally, I would regard professional football as full time employment. You are to present yourself to a rugby league side nominated by you and do all you can to gain selection in that side and to maintain a place in the playing side of that team.

   DECISION: 
   1. Allow the appeal and quash the sentences appealed from. 2. For each of the 2003 offence and the offences in counts 2, 3 and 4, impose imprisonment for a fixed term of six months commencing on 6 February 2006 and expiring on 5 August 2006. Take into account for the 2003 offence the matter listed in the schedule. 3. For each of the offences in 5, 6 and 7 impose imprisonment for a fixed term of six months commencing on 6 May 2006 and expiring on 5 November 2006. 4. For each of the offences in count 8, 9 and 10 impose imprisonment for a fixed term of six months commencing on 6 August 2006 and expiring on 5 February 2007. 5. For the offence charged in the first count, and taking into account the thirty-eight other matters in the schedule, impose imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years, commencing on 6 February 2007, and a balance of term of three years. The reason for the imposition of a balance of term exceeding one-third of the non-parole period is the special need of the respondent for the extended support of the officers of the Probation and Parole Service in his efforts to rid himself of his addiction to illegal drugs and the criminal consequences thereof. 6. Order that the respondent pay compensation in the sum of $4,500.00. 7. Declare that the first day on which the respondent will be eligible for release on parole will be 5 February 2009.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: I agree with Barr J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against what is said to be the inadequacy of a series of sentences imposed in the District Court upon the respondent, Troy Rodney Hardes.  
     
      
    3 The respondent is a man thirty-three years old at the time of sentence. When he was fifteen years old his parents separated and he went to live with his father. His father died and he was left homeless. On the streets, he was introduced to illegal drugs. He had no skill and no job and stole to get by. His first gaol term, for stealing, began when he was eighteen years old. Between then and a time shortly before the present sentences were imposed he lived a more or less routine life, stealing and using the proceeds to buy heroin and otherwise survive. On occasions he was caught and sent to prison. Over that period of fifteen or so years he spent seven or eight years in custody. Nothing that happened to him inside or outside prison made any impression on the life he was leading. He told the sentencing judge that it was like a revolving door.  
     
      
    4 Not long before he was sentenced for the current matters the respondent was ordered to serve a series of sentences whose non-parole periods expired in August 2005. Upon his release he took up his old activities. Between the end of November 2005 and the beginning of February 2006 he broke and entered domestic premises in Newcastle and stole on no fewer than forty-eight occasions. As he told the sentencing judge, his technique was simple. He would walk up to a house and knock at the door. If it was answered he would make up some story and go away. If it was not he would break in and take what he could find. When he was caught he admitted these matters to the police. He accompanied them to the premises he had broken into and told them things they would not otherwise have known. When he was taken to court he told the magistrate that he intended to plead guilty to all the charges. So he came before the District Court.  
     
      
    5 There were ten counts in the document of committal. The first was the most serious. The respondent broke into a house in Mayfield and stole a large amount of jewellery, work samples, watches and electrical equipment. The total value of the property stolen was a little under $20,000.00. He was arrested after DNA extracted from samples taken from the scene was found to match his. The circumstances giving rise to the other nine counts were of the same kind. The value of goods stolen was considerable. For each of the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth counts his Honour sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for a fixed term of six months. The sentences were staggered so that the first three commenced on 6 February, the next three on 6 March and the last three on 6 April 2006. For the offence in the first count, and taking into account the thirty-eight matters listed in the schedule, his Honour sentenced the respondent to a non-parole period of one year and six months, accumulated upon the last of the fixed terms, and a balance of sentence of one year. The resulting overall sentence was of three years and two months, comprising a non-parole period of two years and two months and a balance of term of one year. His Honour ordered the payment of compensation.  
     
      
    6 At the same time his Honour dealt with an offence committed by the respondent on 20 December 2003. It was part of a much earlier crop of offences and it did not appear why it had not been dealt with on one of the many earlier occasions the respondent had been before the courts. His Honour regarded it as stale and sentenced the respondent to a fixed term of imprisonment of six months concurrent with the first three bracketed sentences I have mentioned.  
     
      
    7 The respondent gave evidence. He told the sentencing judge about his history with drugs and crime and said that he was sick of it. He told how he had volunteered having committed some of the offences, enabling the police to charge him with crimes which would otherwise have remained unsolved. He said that he had always used illegal drugs in gaol but had not done so during his latest period of imprisonment. He was free of drugs for the first time in his adult life. He had been given the job of sweeper, one normally given only to trusted inmates. He had a girlfriend who visited him regularly and brought his daughter to see him. He was participating in drug and alcohol courses for the first time. He had always resisted taking on a Methadone program but had this time committed himself to such a program. He expected to serve a period of custody and then, under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, to enter a full-time drug release program. He said that he was serving his sentence on protection, having refused requests of other inmates to have his visitors bring drugs into the gaol.  
     
      
    8 His Honour said this -  
     
      
       
        
        There has never been a period, till recently, when he was off drugs, even in gaol. He has a daughter and presently a person he describes as his ""girlfriend"". 
        
       
       
        
        His adult life has revolved around drugs and crime. It would seem that at this stage, for the first time in his adult life, he is trying to make some progress. He is accepted as a sweeper in gaol and he has entered the methadone program and he has been drug free for some months, that is since he entered custody in February.  
         
         
        He has done drug and alcohol courses in gaol. He said that the methadone seems to be working. He also accepts that he may have to go into fulltime rehabilitation when he leaves gaol. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Presently he is serving his sentence on protection, he having been approached to arrange the importation of drugs into the prison system. He has resisted that and as a result of threats he now is likely to spend the rest of his time in custody in protection. He is entitled to have that taken into account in assessing the length of sentence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        He faces a very heavy sentence but he pleaded guilty. Some of the cases were quite strong against him, with the 
         
        fingerprint evidence but he did drive around with police, co-operated and assisted them in trying to bring before 
         
        the Court all the matters that he was involved in. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        There is a utilitarian discount in the plea and it does show some remorse, having regard to the change in attitude that is developing, what his solicitor called and understanding that he is at the crossroads. 
        
       
      
    9 The Crown submitted that the resulting sentence was so low as to demand the intervention of this Court. The maximum penalty on each count was imprisonment for fourteen years. It was submitted that given the serious nature of the offences against the background of the respondent’s long history of like offences a substantial custodial sentence was called for, even giving proper weight to the fact that the respondent himself disclosed his commission of some of the offences and the promise he was holding out of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    10 The principal features by which the seriousness of the offences was to be assessed were these -  
     
      
       
        
        (a) the seriousness of offences of that kind, as evidenced by the maximum penalty of fourteen years’ imprisonment; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the multiplicity of offences; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the substantial value of the goods stolen; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) that the respondent was on conditional liberty the whole time; and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) that the respondent had a prior record for offences of the same kind: see  
        Attorney-General’s Application [No 1] 
        ;  
        R v Ponfield 
         [1999] NSWCCA 435, particularly at [48] sub paras [vi], [viii], [i] and [iii].  
        
       
      
    11 His Honour was obliged to mitigate the sentences imposed to give effect to these matters -  
     
      
       
        
        (a) the satisfaction that the respondent’s claim to have changed his attitude was genuine; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the early pleas of guilty, which his Honour assessed as worth a twenty-five per cent reduction for their utilitarian value alone; and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the respondent’s remorse, as evidenced by the pleas of guilty and his co-operation with police, which extended to the disclosure of his participation in offences the police were unlikely otherwise to be able to establish:  
        R v Ellis 
         (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. 
        
       
      
    12 The judge was entitled to extend the balance of the total effective term at the expense of the non-parole period in order to provide for an extended period of parole in view of the respondent’s peculiar need for support consequent upon the difficult course of rehabilitation he had decided upon. Even then, however, the ultimate non-parole period had to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences: Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525. 13 Counsel for the respondent reminded the Court that Crown appeals should be rare and that sentences should be set aside only where a clear error of principle has been identified. Counsel referred to the evidence of rehabilitation and the well-known judgment of King CJ in The Queen v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212 at 212-3. The submission was that despite the seriousness of the offences this was an occasion for the extension of mercy. The Court was reminded of its lively discretion to refuse to intervene even where error is shown: R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561.  
     
      
    14 It seems to me that, even after the substantial allowance his Honour was entitled to make for an extended period of time on parole, the sentence imposed on the first count and the resulting total effective sentence was, by reference to the factors I have identified, inadequate to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences.  
     
      
    15 Counsel for the respondent read on the appeal an affidavit of the respondent. In it the respondent confirmed his determination to change his life and his appreciation that doing so would be hard and would take a long time. He said that he had already participated in a number of courses and was enrolled for others. He had attended drug and alcohol programs once each week. He had remained on the Methadone program, maintaining a steady dose, and planned to remain on that program. He had been free from illicit drugs since his incarceration and had committed no offences. He was on a course to move to a C2 classification, probably in April 2007 and was looking forward to a transfer to a place which would allow for more frequent visits of his girlfriend and his daughter.  
     
      
    16 It is encouraging that the promise that was held out at the time of sentencing continues to be one in which the Court can have confidence. The material put forward by the respondent in his affidavit is impressive but does not persuade me that the Court ought to exercise its discretion so as not to interfere with the sentences.  
     
      
    17 When this Court quashes a sentence and imposes a greater one following a successful Crown appeal, that sentence is generally towards the lower end of the available range of sentence: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54. 18 I propose the following orders -  
     
      
       
        
        1. Allow the appeal and quash the sentences appealed from. 
        
       
       
        
        2. For each of the 2003 offence and the offences in counts 2, 3 and 4, impose imprisonment for a fixed term of six months commencing on 6 February 2006 and expiring on 5 August 2006. In doing so I take into account for the 2003 offence the matter listed in the schedule.  
        
       
       
        
        3. For each of the offences in 5, 6 and 7 impose imprisonment for a fixed term of six months commencing on 6 May 2006 and expiring on 5 November 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        4. For each of the offences in count 8, 9 and 10 impose imprisonment for a fixed term of six months commencing on 6 August 2006 and expiring on 5 February 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        5. For the offence charged in the first count, and taking into account the thirty-eight other matters in the schedule, impose imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years, commencing on 6 February 2007, and a balance of term of three years. The reason for the imposition of a balance of term exceeding one-third of the non-parole period is the special need of the respondent for the extended support of the officers of the Probation and Parole Service in his efforts to rid himself of his addiction to illegal drugs and the criminal consequences thereof. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Order that the respondent pay compensation in the sum of $4,500.00.  
        
       
       
        
        7. Declare that the first day on which the respondent will be eligible for release on parole will be 5 February 2009. 
        
       
      
    19 My intention in so arranging these sentences is to achieve an effective overall sentence of six years, equally divided between non-parole and parole periods.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 Howie J  This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon the applicant in the District Court by Marien DCJ (the Judge). On 21 October 2005 the applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to an offence of malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. This is an offence for which a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment is prescribed and to which a standard non-parole period of 10 years applies. 
     
      
    4 On 24 March 2006 the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months and a balance of term of 3 years 6 months. The sentence commenced on 8 December 2004 and the applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 7 June 2010. 
     
      
    5 The victim was the estranged wife of the applicant. They separated in August 2004 and the applicant moved away from the family home. The victim had continued to have contact with a former husband, the father of her child, but was not in an intimate relationship with him. However, the applicant was suspicious of this relationship. 
     
      
    6 On 6 October 2004 the applicant came to the house and demanded to know what was going on between the victim and her ex-husband and told her that he had heard rumours they were going to go back together. The applicant became angry and assaulted the victim by slapping her on the face and grabbing her throat. As a result the victim took out an apprehended violence order against the applicant. The applicant was charged with assault and on 23 November 2004 was place on a good behaviour bond under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It was a condition of the bond that he not assault or interfere with the victim. 
     
      
    7 In December 2004 there were discussions about the applicant and the wife resuming their relationship and they spoke together by telephone on 6 December the day before the offence. She told him that she thought they should wait. He asked whether they could see one another but she said to leave it for the time being. 
     
      
    8 The next morning, 7 December 2004 the applicant rang the victim and asked if he could bring some flowers for their wedding anniversary. He later arrived with a bunch of roses. He told her that he wanted to talk about their relationship but she asked him to leave. He told her he wanted to make love to her but she refused. He dragged her to the bedroom where her son was present, and the applicant told him to go to bed. 
     
      
    9 The applicant first struck the victim to the head, and then placed his hand over her mouth and nose restricting her breathing. He threatened to kill her son. She struggled trying to make her way to the front door but the applicant grabbed her by the hair and pulled her to the kitchen. He grabbed a knife from the counter and stabbed her about six to eight times to the upper body. He then dropped the knife and left the scene. The victim was taken to hospital and treated for two large wounds, one to the left side of the chest and the other to her upper back. She suffered a collapsed lung. 
     
      
    10 Police were unable to find the applicant. However, that evening he rang Mr Scott, one of the persons from his workplace, and said that he had killed the victim. When asked why, he replied, “I saw Sylvia’s [the wife’s] ex husband. They were fucking in my house. I had to kill her”. Mr Scott told the applicant to hand himself into police. They spoke again a short time later and the applicant said he was going to commit suicide. Mr Scott again told the applicant to go to the police, but he refused saying that he did not want to go to gaol. However, on 8 December the applicant attended the local police station and surrendered. 
     
      
    11 As a result of the attack upon her the victim made a fair physical recovery except for some nerve damage to one arm and a lacking of feeling in some of her fingers. She has scarring to her body. She was traumatised by the event and unable to return to her own home. She lacked trust in her relationships and could not allow her son to be left with anyone. She suffered from poor sleep and flashbacks. She has no social life. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was aged 36 years at the time of the offence. He had no criminal record except for the assault offence against the victim. He has very large family and community support. The applicant had been receiving counselling since the offence from a psychologist, who prepared a report for the sentencing court. The applicant had expressed guilt and remorse for the offence to the psychologist. He was of the opinion that the applicant’s “personal and social functioning were highly destabilised” and that up to the time of offending “his personal adjustment was adversely preoccupied with the loss of his marriage”. The applicant said that he had memory loss for the date of the offending and the psychologist explained this as “disassociation”. The psychologist considered that the applicant’s prognosis was positive as the applicant had “experienced deeply profound lessons from his actions and is very unlikely to repeat them”. 
     
      
    13 The Judge found that the offence was an unplanned and spontaneous act. However he regarded the circumstances of the offending as very serious describing it as a “ferocious and frenzied attack”. He stated that it was unprovoked by any actions of the victim or her former husband. The Judge found that the extent of the injuries and disabilities to the victim were substantial and an aggravating factor. He also held that there was gratuitous cruelty in the acts committed by the applicant prior to the stabbing including the threats made to kill the victim’s son. However, the Judge concluded that the applicant was at the time of the commission of the offences in a state of emotional upheaval and that his moral culpability was mitigated to an extent by his mental state. 
     
      
    14 The Judge referred to the fact that the applicant pleaded guilty on arraignment. Although he found that it was not a plea at the earliest convenience, the Judge noted that it saved the victim from giving evidence. He thought that a discount in the middle of the normal range would be appropriate. The Judge found that the applicant was contrite and that this would moderate the sentence. He held that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    15 The first ground of appeal contends that the Judge erred by placing inappropriate reliance on the standard non-parole period for the offence even though the applicant pleaded guilty. In particular complaint was made about the following passage towards the end of the sentencing remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Accordingly, in sentencing the Offender, I propose to impose a non parole period which is less than the standard non parole period applicable for that offence and in particular the reason I am not imposing the standard non parole is, despite my finding as to the objective seriousness of the offence, the fact that he has pleaded guilty at a relatively early stage and in my view his positive prospects of rehabilitation warranting the finding of special circumstances and a variation on the statutory ratio. 
        
       
      
    16 It was submitted that, notwithstanding that the Judge had referred extensively to Way in his sentencing remarks and had quoted the summary of that case given by Simpson J in AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575, he had misconceived the manner in which he was to approach the standard non-parole period. It was submitted that the Judge ought to have referred to it merely as a guidepost or reference point but he had allowed it to dominate his discretion. In advancing this criticism the applicant’s counsel, Mr Lange, referred the Court to R v Ancuta [2005] NSWCCA 275 and R v Sangalang [2005] NSWCCA 171 which he said were authority for the proposition that a judge should “state no more than that he or she has used the standard non-parole period as a reference point”. The submissions indicated that the correct approach was contained in Sangalang at [22] and the following passage from that decision was quoted in support:  
     
      
       
        
         
        A sentencing judge should state no more than that he or she has used the standard non-parole period as a reference point or guidepost, and then identify the appropriate non-parole period, describing where significant any particular matters taken into account in doing so. 
         
        
       
       
      It was argued that the passage quoted above evinced the erroneous approach adopted by the Judge. 
       
      
    17 In my view the ground has no merit. The Judge was doing no more in the passage quoted than complying with s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act by exposing his reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. It has been made clear in a number of decisions of this Court that, notwithstanding that an offender has pleaded guilty, the court is still required to “identify…each factor that it took into account” in increasing or decreasing the standard non-parole period: see s 54B(3) and R v Zegura [2006] NSWCCA 230. 
     
      
    18 In the present case, after considering the various aggravating and mitigating factors, the Judge found that the objective seriousness of the offence fell slightly above the midrange of seriousness. He then took into account as a “further aggravating factor” that the applicant was on a good behaviour bond for assaulting the victim. There is a ground of appeal relating to that finding that I will deal with shortly, but it is clear that the Judge, having considered the objective facts of the offence and formed a view as to where in the range of offending the present offence lay, then went on to consider other matters to see whether they aggravated or mitigated the seriousness of the offence. This is precisely what is required by Way. 
     
      
    19 The Judge then formed the view that he should depart from the standard non-parole period by giving the applicant the benefit of a discount for the plea of guilty and by a finding of special circumstances. In my opinion, rather than disclosing any error, the sentencing remarks show an attempt by the Judge to apply the standard non-parole period in precisely the way that has been approved by this Court: see MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271. There is nothing in either Ancuta or Sangalang to suggest otherwise. Ancuta was a case where the sentencing judge had erred by oscillating about the standard non-parole period by adding and subtracting factors. Sangalang was a case where the judge used the standard non-parole period as a starting point from which to make deductions rather than as a reference point to determine the appropriate non-parole period. The passage quoted from Sangalang in the written submissions is taken entirely out of context and is with respect misleading. The following is the full passage from the judgment of Hunt AJA with the quoted passage in italics: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [22] It could perhaps be that the judge merely intended to say that he had fixed the non-parole period appropriate to the present case at four years, and then merely described it as the equivalent of eighty per cent of the standard non-parole period, but if he did reason in that way (which I doubt) his description was a particularly unfortunate one.  
        A sentencing judge should state no more than that he or she has used the standard non-parole period as a reference point or guidepost, and then identify the appropriate non-parole period, describing where significant any particular matters taken into account in doing so. 
         That appropriate non-parole period should never be described as a percentage of the standard non-parole period. 
         
        
       
      
    20 The second ground of appeal relates to the fact that the applicant was on a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for assaulting his wife at the time of the commission of the offence and what use his Honour made of that fact. It was submitted that the Judge was not permitted to take into account the facts of that matter because to do so would be to deprive the applicant of the benefit of the dismissal of that charge under s 10. 
     
      
    21 After finding that the objective seriousness of the offence was “slightly above the mid range” the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “A further aggravating factor in my view is the fact that some two months prior to this offence the Offender had assaulted Ms Frigiani. That firstly, of course, disentitles him from leniency in my view. But it demonstrates by way as an aggravating factor not aggravating in the sense that it makes the offence more objectively serious but for the reasons explained in Veen (No 2) and the recent decision of Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349. That prior matter so soon before the commission of this offence clearly indicates that greater weight needs to be placed on the factor of personal deterrence in the sentencing exercise. 
         
         
        Further, the offence is aggravated by the fact that the offence was committed whilst the Offender was subject to the constraints of a good behaviour bond under section 10, as well as an apprehended violence order. The Courts have stressed time and time again that apprehended violence orders must be observed. It is hard to imagine a more serious breach of that order than what occurred in this case.” 
        
       
      
    22 The argument is that his Honour was not entitled to take into account an offence dealt with under s 10 as disentitling the offender to a finding of good character and, therefore, so the argument ran, the Judge could not take into account the conduct giving rise to that offence. The argument was founded on what was said by Simpson J in R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [36] In my opinion there are good reasons for interpreting s21A(2)(d) as proposed on behalf of the applicant, that is strictly, and excluding reference to an offence in respect of which the offender has been given the benefit of a s10 order, from s21A(2)(d). Firstly, s21A(2)(d) is, in effect, a penal provision, which ought to be construed strictly, and beneficially to those against whom it operates. That is a conventional principle of statutory construction. Secondly, a s10 order is intended, expressly, to permit an offender to retain the benefit of good character. To extend the meaning of “conviction” in s21A(2)(d) to include a finding of guilt for an offence in respect of which no conviction has been recorded would be to defeat at least part of the object of s10. This court has held that s21A(2)(d) involves the application of the principles stated in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465: see R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193. 
        
       
      
    23 It can be seen immediately from this quote that her Honour was concerned with the application of s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and whether the existence of an offence which was dealt with pursuant to s 10 can be treated as an aggravating factor under that provision. Neither this passage nor the reasons of her Honour elsewhere in the judgment gives the slightest support for the submission that a court is prohibited from taking into account prior conduct that has been dealt with under s 10. 
     
      
    24 It is clear that the prior matter was relevant in two ways. Firstly it was an aggravating factor because the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced was committed in breach of a good behaviour bond. That is an aggravating factor listed in s 21A(2)(j) regardless of the conduct in respect of which the bond was imposed. However, it is generally considered to be more aggravating when the conduct is similar to that for which the offender is being sentenced. The second paragraph of his Honour’s remarks quoted above reflects this fact. 
     
      
    25 Secondly, the fact that the applicant had assaulted his wife was relevant to show that the offence for which he was being sentenced was not an aberration. For this purpose it was enough that the applicant had been found guilty of that conduct even though no conviction had been recorded against him. In part the first paragraph of the remarks quoted above reflect this fact. 
     
      
    26 However, I doubt that it was appropriate for the Judge to refer to Veen (No 2) in this regard or Palmer, which was a case concerned with an offender with a lengthy criminal record. In my opinion care should be taken when referring to Veen and the principles for which it stands when discussing the relevance of criminal record. It was never intended to refer to a situation where there was only one prior offence recorded against the offender even if the conduct of that offence was similar to that for which sentence was being passed. Simpson J pointed this out in part of her judgment in Price on which the applicant’s counsel did not rely. The Judge was correct to hold that he needed to take into account personal deterrence, but he did not need to rely upon Veen for support for that proposition. 
     
      
    27 In my opinion neither of the grounds relied upon are made out. Therefore, I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon the applicant in the District Court on 11 February 2005 by Berman DCJ, following the applicant’s plea of guilty to a charge that, between 1 June 1999 and 1 February 2000, he was knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine. Pursuant to s235(2)(c)(ii) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) the maximum penalty applicable to the offence was imprisonment for life, together with a fine not exceeding $750,000. 
     
      
    2 Berman DCJ sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment for 20 years and six months, with a non-parole period of 13 years. The applicant now contends that this sentence was affected by error in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    3 Although he was represented by counsel at sentencing, the applicant has, throughout the appeal process, represented himself. He has identified three grounds of appeal, which he frames as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “- discriminatory treatment in sentencing 
         
        - criminality issue in sentencing 
         
        - issue estoppel” 
        
       
      
    4 In support, he has provided extremely lengthy written submissions. These are not easy to follow and reflect and portray his lack of legal training. 
     
      
    5 It is, however, convenient to begin by outlining a history of the proceedings, followed by the facts on the basis of which the sentence was passed. 
     
      
       
      Procedural history 
       
      
    6 The applicant was arrested at Patonga at 3.30 am on 1 February 2000. Also arrested at or about the same time were Garry William Bartle; Maximiliano Diez; Peter Daryl Fox; Sir Thomas Graham Fry; Thomas McCaffery; Roberto Angelo Roberti. Arrested separately, but also involved in the same enterprise, was Russell Douglas Bateman. 
     
      
    7 In 2001 the applicant, together with Bartle, Fry, Roberti, Diez, Fox and McCaffery was tried in the District Court before Dodd DCJ and a jury. The trial proceeded over seven months. All were convicted. On 26 October 2001, Dodd DCJ sentenced all seven. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 24 years with a non-parole period of 16 years. Bateman pleaded guilty. He gave assistance to police by providing information and agreeing to give evidence in the prosecution of the other men. On 31 August 2000 he was sentenced by James J in the Supreme Court to imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of eight and a half years. This sentence incorporated a discount of 50% on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, referable to subjective circumstances and the assistance provided, and, presumably, his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    8 All seven convicted after trial appealed to this Court against their convictions. On 3 December 2003 this Court upheld the appeals against convictions in respect of three of the men, including the applicant, and ordered a new trial. (R v Bartle and Others [2003] NSWCCA 329; 181 FLR 1) It is unnecessary to go into the reasons that led to this result. 
     
      
    9 The re-trial was fixed to commence in the District Court on 5 July 2004 before Berman DCJ. On that date the applicant entered a plea of guilty to the charge. (Subsequently, McCaffery also pleaded guilty, and Fox was convicted by a jury.) 
     
      
    10 On 11 February 2005 Berman DCJ sentenced the applicant in the terms set out above – imprisonment for 20 years and six months, with a non-parole period of 13 years, commencing on 1 February 2000. It will be observed that the sentence then imposed is less than that imposed by Dodd DCJ. The explanation for this lies in the applicant’s plea of guilty: Berman DCJ allowed a reduction on sentence, purportedly in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
       
      The facts of the offence 
       
      
    11 The facts of the offence were put before Berman DCJ by way of an agreed statement. The applicant did not give or call evidence. 
     
      
    12 As may be gleaned from the number of co-offenders who have been before the courts, and the length of the original trial (seven months), the cocaine importation was part of an elaborate and highly organised enterprise. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was a New Zealand resident. He was also a master mariner. He knew the man called Sir Thomas Fry. (According to James J, who sentenced Bateman, the “Sir” in Fry’s name does not denote elevated rank, but rather, is a given name.) Fry owned a large yacht called the Lone Bird that was moored in Gisborne, New Zealand. 
     
      
    14 In September 1999 Fry flew to Columbia under an assumed name, where he arranged for a large quantity of cocaine to be transported by ship (a yacht called the Bora Bora II) to the vicinity of the North Island of New Zealand. The plan was for Fry and others, including the applicant, to meet the vessel, unload the cocaine, reload it onto the Lone Bird, and transport it to Australia. Others were to meet the yacht in Sydney, offload the drug, and deliver it to a participant called Diez. 
     
      
    15 On 16 October 1999 Bora Bora II left South America, the aim being to meet Lone Bird off the northern tip of New Zealand in mid January 2000. Bora Bora II was carrying approximately half a tonne of powder containing cocaine. Unfortunately for the participants, Lone Bird was unseaworthy. A large amount of money was spent on repairs but it could not be made seaworthy. From October/November 1999 the applicant was involved in attempts to repair the yacht. Ultimately, it was decided to abandon Lone Bird and purchase another yacht. 
     
      
    16 Acting on behalf of another participant, McCaffery, who provided the finance, the applicant located, and entered into an agreement to purchase, another yacht, the Ngaire Wha, in Auckland. The purchase was completed on 13 December 1999. The applicant also purchased a dinghy and outboard motor. Ngaire Wha left New Zealand on 14 January 2000, in order to meet Bora Bora II. The applicant and two others (Roberti and Fry) were on board. On 19 January 2000 Bora Bora II arrived in the North Island of New Zealand. The two yachts met (it is not clear where) and the cocaine that was on Bora Bora II was transferred to Ngaire Wha. Ngaire Wha set sail for Sydney. It arrived on 1 February 2000, mooring at Patonga. At 3.30 am that day police boarded, discovered the cocaine, and arrested the applicant and Roberti. Others were arrested on land. 
     
      
    17 On analysis, the substance on board proved to contain 383.443 kilograms of pure cocaine, with a wholesale value of more than $60 million. 
     
      
    18 On arrest the applicant gave a false first name and otherwise refused to provide any details. Later, after taking legal advice, he gave his correct name, but declined to participate in a recorded interview. 
     
      
       
      Other factual matters relevant to the grounds of appeal 
       
      
    19 Two co-offenders, Bateman and Bartle, who were Australian citizens but of British origin, have, pursuant to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, been transferred to the United Kingdom to serve their sentences in accordance with the agreements between this country and the United Kingdom. Because of those arrangements, and parole practices in the United Kingdom, Bateman was released on parole approximately two years earlier than would have been the case had he remained in the Australian prison system. Bartle will be eligible for parole under that system in January 2012. 
     
      
    20 Both Fox and McCaffery have also applied for transfer under the Convention, but their applications have not been determined. 
     
      
    21 No arrangements of a like kind exist between Australia and New Zealand, the applicant’s home country. He will therefore serve the entirety of his sentence in this country in accordance with the NSW sentence administration regime. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    22 The applicant was born on 19 March 1953 in New Zealand, into an academically gifted and high achieving family. His father was a general practitioner. He is one of seven children, of whom a number are practitioners of medicine, law, or other professions. He himself trained as a journalist but is said to have experienced some sense of underachievement relative to other members of his family. 
     
      
    23 He was, for some years, engaged in developing a fibreglass business in Mauritius, and in another business in France. 
     
      
    24 In 1977 he was convicted in New Zealand of an offence of importing cannabis in respect of which he was sentenced to three and a half years’ imprisonment. In 1992 he was again sentenced, this time in Perth, in respect of a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of cannabis into Australia. After a successful Crown appeal, his sentence was of imprisonment for nine years with a non-parole period of five years. At the time of this offence, the applicant had been released on parole. The parole period had not expired and he remained subject to the conditions of the parole order. 
     
      
    25 Notwithstanding this rather discouraging history, a psychologist who provided a report for sentencing purposes considered that the applicant had some insight into the gravity of his offending, and a strong resolve to refrain from future criminal activities. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing remarks 
       
      
    26 In sentencing the applicant Berman DCJ set out the circumstances of the importation enterprise, paying particular attention to the role played by the applicant. Given that this is of some significance in the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to refer to those findings in some detail. 
     
      
    27 His Honour found that the applicant first became involved in the scheme when he participated in the work to make the Lone Bird seaworthy; and thereafter in the selection and purchase of a replacement vessel. He also found that the applicant was involved in equipping the Ngaire Wha by, inter alia, renting a storage unit in Albany. He noted the applicant’s experience as a mariner and rejected a submission put to him that he was no more than “a deckhand”. His Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that from the moment he began working on the Lone Bird the applicant was aware that the intention was that it would be used to transport a large amount of cocaine to Australia. He found that the applicant was working full time on the scheme from about December 1999, contributed his expertise in selection of the Ngaire Wha and its preparation for sailing to Australia and that he played: 
     
      
       
        
        “a significant, if not the primary, role in sailing the yacht to Australia.” 
        
       
      
    28 Relative to other offenders, Berman DCJ found that the applicant played an equivalent role to the roles played by Roberti and Bartle. In comparing the role of the applicant with the roles payed by McCaffery and Fox, Berman DCJ departed from the conclusion reached by the previous sentencing judge, Dodd DCJ, that the roles of these two offenders and that of the applicant were also equivalent. He considered the applicant’s criminality to be greater than the criminality of either of those offenders. 
     
      
    29 He noted the applicant’s prior record for importation of drugs, and that, at the time of this offence, the applicant was on parole in respect of the previous (Perth) offence and correctly regarded this as a matter of serious aggravation. 
     
      
    30 Curiously, in light of the procedural history I have outlined above, Berman DCJ acknowledged the applicant’s plea of guilty by reducing the sentence imposed by Dodd DCJ by 15%. This, it seems to me, represents a misconception of the effects of the decision of this Court in R v Thomson; R v Houlton. While Thomson and Houlton acknowledges the appropriateness of discounting sentences where an offender pleads guilty, it does not lay down, as an absolute rule, that, in every case where a plea of guilty is entered, a sentence must be reduced: see R v Daley [2003] NSWCCA 109. Here, the applicant had participated in a seven-month trial, and had appealed against the conviction, before accepting the reality of his conduct. While it is true that avoidance of the re-trial carried with it some (indeed, having regard to the length of the original trial, considerably) utilitarian benefit, it does not thereby follow that he was entitled to such a reduction. Indeed, it is more than a little peculiar that an offender who eventually pleads guilty after a trial, appeal, and at the commencement of a proposed re-trial, is better off than an offender who accepts the verdict of a jury after trial. However, this matter is not the subject of contention either by the applicant or by the Crown and I need not trouble with it further. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal 
       
      
    31 I have above set out the applicant’s encapsulation of the grounds of appeal. In the course of his lengthy written submissions the applicant set out or referred to significant and, indeed, extensive, factual matters. This includes reference to evidence he claims to have been given by him and others. The papers demonstrate that the applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings before Berman DCJ. The evidence to which he was referring was evidence that he gave in the trial before Dodd DCJ. This was not before Berman DCJ and cannot be used as part of the present proceedings. This Court must proceed to determine the application on the basis of the material that was before Berman DCJ. 
     
      
    32 In any event, the factual matters include references to evidence indicating when the applicant became aware of the nature of the criminal enterprise. Berman DCJ made appropriate findings of fact based upon the agreed statement of facts that had been put before him. Nothing has been advanced by way of challenge to those findings that could possibly succeed in establishing error of fact on the part of his Honour. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of the application 
       
       
      1. “discriminatory treatment/sentence” 
       
      
    33 I take this to be a ground raising issues of parity. The applicant put extensive written submissions concerning parity, including lengthy extracts from authority in this Court and the High Court. Much of this is, by reason of the applicant’s lack of legal training, misdirected. 
     
      
    34 As I understand it, the nub of his argument in respect of parity concerns the transfers of Bateman and Bartle to Britain, where, it appears, parole arrangements are such that Bateman has derived, and Bartle might derive, a benefit in serving a lower proportion of the sentence in custody. 
     
      
    35 I am unable to see that this raises any issue of parity. Parity is concerned with sentencing like offenders to like punishments. Transfer of prisoners to other countries involves arrangements made between the Commonwealth of Australia and other countries. It is not a matter to which a sentencing judge can or should have regard. It is far removed from the sentencing process. Apart from anything else, whether or not one prisoner is to be transferred to serve a sentence in another country is something that will seldom, if ever, be known at the time of sentencing. Certainly, there was no reason for Berman DCJ to have been aware of what lay in the future for Bateman or Bartle. 
     
      
    36 There is no substance in this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      2. “issue estoppel” 
       
      
    37 As far as I can determine from the applicant’s written submissions, the “issue” the subject of this ground of appeal concerns what the applicant knew, or more accurately, when the applicant knew of the proposed importation. In this respect he quoted from the judgment of Smart AJ in the appeal the subject of the judgment in R v Bartle and Others, where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury may not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to Thompson’s knowledge that cocaine was to be or was being imported prior to the transhipment of the cocaine at sea.” 
        
       
      
    38 That may have been so in relation to the trial; but it is not now the case, where the sentencing judge has been provided with an extensive agreed statement of facts and has made an available finding on the basis thereof. There is no “issue estoppel” in the observation made by Smart AJ. Indeed, the applicant wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thompson argues the determination of the NSWCCA  
        Bartle v Orrs 
         (sic) (2003) 329 at (839) quashing Thompson’s conviction creating an estoppel in the accused’s favour on that issue.” 
        
       
      
    39 That paragraph incorporated the passage extracted above. Smart AJ made his observation in the context of determining that it would be inappropriate to apply the proviso to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It has no bearing upon the finding made by Berman DCJ. It does not represent or contain any concluded finding of fact, such as is necessary to amount to an issue estoppel. 
     
      
       
      3. “criminality issue/sentence” 
       
      
    40 I do not find it easy to understand the submissions advanced by the applicant in respect of this ground. However, they appear to be a detailed canvassing of factual matters concerning his role in the enterprise. Specifically, he appears to contend that he only became aware of the importation once he was at sea. This overlaps with the matters dealt with under Ground 1. As I have made plain already, the finding of the sentencing judge concerning the applicant’s role in the enterprise was open to him and has not been shown in any way to have been incorrect. 
     
      
    41 Accordingly, this ground of the application, like the others, ought to be rejected. 
     
      
    42 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    43 HOWIE J: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    44 HISLOP J: I agree with Simpson J.

    3 PRICE J: David Kent Lawler seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him by J X Gibson ADCJ in the District Court at Gosford on 29 September 2005.  
     
      
    4 On 13 May 2005 the applicant pleaded guilty upon arraignment in the District Court to three offences, namely: 
     
      
       
      Count one 
      : on 22 October 2004 at Calga did feloniously slay Ann Marie Parker.  
       
       
      Count two 
      : on 22 October 2004 at Calga did drive a vehicle, namely a 1988 Volvo F12 prime mover and attached trailer, in a manner dangerous to other persons, whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which grievous bodily harm was occasioned to Joy Noble. 
       
       
      Count three: 
       on 22 October 2004 at Calga did drive a vehicle, namely a 1988 Volvo F12 prime mover and attached trailer, whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which grievous bodily harm was occasioned to Stephen Connell. 
       
      
    5 The first count is one of manslaughter contrary to s 18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence is punishable by imprisonment for 25 years. 
     
      
    6 The second and third counts are counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900. Offences contrary to s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act are punishable by seven years imprisonment. 
     
      
    7 The following charges were included on a s 166 certificate: 
     
      
       
      (i) Use unregistered vehicle 
       
      
     (ii) Use uninsured vehicle  
     
      
     (iii) Use unauthorised number plate on vehicle  
     
      
     (iv) Goods in custody (registration plates) 
     
      
     (v) Display misleading registration label 
     
      
     (vi) Use unauthorised number plate on trailer.  
     
      
    8 The Judge imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
      Count one 
      : The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight years commencing on 13 May 2005 and expiring on 12 May 2013 as part of an overall sentence of ten years and eight months commencing on 13 May 2005 and expiring on 12 January 2016. 
       
       
      Count two 
      : The applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 13 May 2005 and expiring on 12 May 2007. 
       
       
      Count three 
      : The applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months commencing on 13 May 2005 and expiring on 12 November 2006.  
       
      
    9 On each charge the applicant was disqualified from holding any licence until 13 May 2013. For each count on the s 166 certificate, the applicant was convicted and fined $110 with no time to pay.  
     
      
    10 Total effective sentence: As a result of the concurrency of the sentences imposed for counts 2 and 3, the applicant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of ten years and eight months with a non-parole period of eight years commencing on 13 May 2005 and expiring on 12 May 2013. 
     
      
     The offences 
     
      
    11 The facts were not in dispute and a statement of ‘Crown Facts’ was tendered at the hearing. The following is a summary drawn largely from that statement:  
     
      
       
      About 5pm on Friday 22 October 2004, the applicant was driving a 1988 Volvo prime mover with a tri-axle flat bed trailer. The trailer was laden with timber and building materials weighing approximately 18 tonne. 
       
       
      The applicant had collected the load from Sydney and was in the process of returning to Newcastle as the load was due for delivery the following day. 
       
       
      At around 5.45pm he drove his vehicle north along the F3 Freeway. Upon reaching the descent to the Mooney Mooney Bridge, he encountered heavy traffic which was moving slowly. All three lanes of northbound traffic were moving at about 10-20 kmph. The traffic had slowed due to a minor collision occurring on the bridge within the southbound lanes. Although this collision did not affect the traffic flow for northbound traffic, drivers were slowing down to view the scene. 
       
       
      The resultant traffic congestion extended for a least 200 metres on the southern approach to the bridge. Drivers travelling in a northerly direction negotiate a long steep decline straight to the bridge. This decline is approximately 1 kilometre in length. 
       
       
      As the applicant approached the slowed vehicles he was unable to slow his vehicle.  
       
       
      At the time the applicant was travelling in lane one. He then entered the western break-down lane where it is estimated he overtook approximately 100 vehicles contained within all three northbound lanes.  
       
       
      Upon reaching the entrance to the bridge, the break-down lane ended. He then merged his vehicle into lane one, realising at this time a collision was inevitable. 
       
       
      The front portion of the applicant’s prime mover collided heavily with the rear portion of the deceased’s, Ann Parker’s, vehicle. This vehicle was a silver Hyundai Excel registration number ANN-282. The Hyundai became wedged under the front of the prime mover where it was forced forward approximately 50 metres, colliding with numerous other vehicles.  
       
       
      Eventually, the Hyundai became free where it came to rest in lane two facing in a generally easterly direction. Almost immediately the Hyundai with Mrs Parker still inside burst into flames, completely destroying the vehicle and incinerating Mrs Ann Parker.  
       
       
      The truck continued on for approximately a further 350 metres. During that distance it collided with another 33 vehicles, before the front portion collided heavily with the rear of a grey Holden Utility XQD-428. This vehicle was overridden by the front of the prime mover and forced forward some distance. 
       
       
      The heavy combination came to rest in lane three in collision with the centre concrete barrier, with the majority of the Holden Utility underneath the front of the prime mover.  
       
       
      As a result of the collision, grievous injuries were occasioned to two drivers, Joy Noble and Stephen Connell, and many other drivers/passengers sustained minor injuries and damage to their motor vehicles. A trail of destruction was left behind, some witnesses describing the scene as looking like ‘a war zone’. 
       
       
      Mrs Noble suffered fractures to her left wrist, soft tissue damage to her left and right shoulders and neck, left knee, right wrist, right arm, upper right thigh, lower right leg and abdomen. She was airlifted to Royal North Shore Hospital from the collision site. She was later admitted to theatre where she underwent an operation to realign her left wrist.  
       
       
      Mr Connell suffered serious internal injuries and was also airlifted to John Hunter Hospital. He remained in hospital for 5 days having sustained fractures to his sternum and ribs, head pain and lacerations to his legs.  
       
       
      Police observed that the collision site extended the entire length of the bridge (approximately 450 metres) and that traffic in the northbound lanes had been completely blocked by the collision. The line of stationary vehicles extended at least 3 kilometres from the commencement of the bridge.  
       
       
      The police asked the applicant at the collision site what happened and he replied: 
       
       
        
        “I came over the hill about 80 and everyone was stopped gawkin at the prang, I pulled it left” 
        
       
       
      He was then asked, “What happened to your brakes, were they working?” And he replied: 
       
      
     “Sort of, not really. I need some liners in a few of them.” 
     
      
       
      Police from the Engineering Investigation Section ascertained upon examination that the braking system for the prime mover and trailer combination was dramatically reduced. There was only one brake on the prime mover and one brake on the trailer that had the potential to offer braking for the vehicle. The remaining ten brakes on the prime mover and trailer combination could not lock or retard the wheels and as such would not assist in braking. The truck and trailer were generally in poor condition due to lack of maintenance. This was evident from the poor condition of brake components, lack of adjustment to brakes, a broken front axle U-bolt, cracks in the trailer chassis rail, exhaust brake air leaks, wiring damage and worn tyres.  
       
       
      The applicant participated in a record of interview (ERISP) at Gosford police station during which he said he was the owner of the truck and trailer which he was aware was not registered and had a false number plate on it. He knew the braking system “wasn’t real crash hot….they work but not very good”. He had known they were not working properly since the beginning of the week but thought that was just on the trailer. The applicant said that the braking system was connected (between the prime mover and trailer) and the poor braking ability of the trailer affected his ability to stop ‘a fair bit’. He said he did the maintenance on the truck himself. He was aware that there were tyres which needed changing. There was one tyre that was basically completely bald and the condition of others was not much good. He said he knew (prior to the collision) it was a dangerous act to drive the vehicle with at least 18 tonne on it with the brakes in that condition and with defective tyres.  
       
       
      Investigations revealed that both the prime mover and the trailer were unregistered and uninsured. 
       
       
      At the time of the collision the prime mover displayed registration number TFK-199. This registration plate belonged to a Hino table-top with the registration expiring on 11 October 2000.  
       
       
      The trailer displayed registration plate number L-88889. This plate belonged to a 1999 box trailer owned by the applicant. The registration of the box trailer expired on 23 March 2005.  
       
      
     Subjective circumstances  
     
      
    12 The applicant was born on 11 September 1959 and was aged 45 years at the time of the offence. Evidence of the applicant’s subjective circumstances was put before the Judge by way of the applicant’s statement, a pre-sentence report dated 18 July 2005, a report of a psychologist Jennifer Hadden and the oral evidence of the applicant himself. Statements were also tendered from his mother and sister. A number of references were also before the Judge. 
     
      
    13 The applicant obtained a heavy vehicle licence when he was 18 years old and drove trucks for his father, doing deliveries in and around Sydney. He purchased his first prime mover and trailer in 1988. Because he had been driving trucks for most of his adult life, he was familiar with truck mechanics and did the regular servicing on the truck himself. In his statement, the applicant detailed the financial pressure he was under at the time of the accident. Ninety per cent of his work came through his brother who had experienced a slump in his business for the six months prior to the accident. As a consequence, the amount of money he was receiving was reduced. With maintenance costs maintained at the same levels, he began to feel the financial pressure. He stopped registering his truck and paying insurance about twelve months prior to the accident. The applicant accepted that the accident was his fault and expressed his remorse. 
     
      
    14 A driver licence was first issued to the applicant on 8 October 1976. His traffic record which reveals numerous driving offences is to be considered in the context of a career as a truck driver.  
     
      
    15 In his remarks on sentence (at pp 3-4) his Honour summarised the applicant’s subjective circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        “Subjectively, the offender is now 46 years of age, he has committed numerous traffic offences in a career as a truck driver but has never served a prison sentence. His traffic record of course is a matter to be taken into consideration not to increase his sentence but in relation to the likelihood of his offending again. I feel that I am able to find that he would be unlikely to offend again on the facts of this case and that record. He will also as a result of these convictions cut himself off from the only occupation he has ever followed. I accept the history he gave as to his education to year 10, and growing up in a family where his father had a trucking business which was ultimately taken over by his brother, then at 18 getting a licence and beginning to subcontract to his brother, and ultimately driving for himself. Apparently this was not successful and he was struggling to keep afloat. Ultimately he allowed his truck to become unregistered and to fall into disrepair because, he said, of the lack of funds. However he continued to drive the vehicle.  
        
       
       
        
        I have read the report of psychologist Jennifer Haddon (sic) and her summary. I accept the fact that he is contrite and remorseful. He entered his pleas at the earliest time and is entitled to the full utilitarian discount. He has been forthcoming to the police and truthful to the police in their investigations right from the start. He has had problems with amphetamines and alcohol but not at the moment. There is no suggestion that he was in any way affected by alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident. 
        
       
       
        
        He has had a number of relationships, the present one extending over a period of sixteen years and has a son from that relationship, Jacob, aged six. His history regarding children and stepchildren is set out in exhibit D1. His present partner describes him as a good father, and partner, and there is a strong, stable and open family life. Exhibit CA. A daughter, Nicky Priestly, aged 17, who lives with the offender, is presently being treated for Hodgkinson’s Disease. It is clear that there is a strong family bond within the family and that the offender is well regarded within the community. Exhibit D4. I take all that into consideration.”  
        
       
      
     Dealing with Appeal  
     
      
    16 The Notice of Appeal identifies two grounds, namely: 
     
      
       
      Ground one 
      : The sentences imposed in their total effect are in all the circumstances manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Ground two 
      : Some other and less severe sentence is warranted in law and ought to have been passed.  
       
      
    17 Although the Notice of appeal identifies two grounds there is in reality one complaint which is that the sentences imposed in their total effect are in all the circumstances manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    18 The Judge when sentencing the applicant said (ROS at 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “The facts have been fully set out in the statement of facts, C1, and I do not propose to elaborate on them other than to say that the offender, with  
        full knowledge 
         of the braking defects in his semi-trailer truck and knowledge of the condition of the tyres, elected to drive it to Sydney and to load it with approximately 18 tons (sic) of freight.” (emphasis added).  
        
       
      
    19 The applicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that he had “full knowledge” as it imputes to him total knowledge of the state of the braking system and tyres disclosed by the subsequent police examination. Such a finding was not open on the evidence, the applicant contends, and was contrary to the state of his knowledge admitted in the ERISP. The finding of total knowledge, the applicant argues, places the degree of moral culpability at the latter (upper) end of the spectrum when the evidence did not justify a finding that he was somewhere within the range.  
     
      
    20 Should his Honour have intended to convey in the passage quoted above that the applicant had total knowledge of the braking defects discovered upon subsequent inspection, it would have been wrong to do so. The applicant’s admissions (in particular see ERISP QQ 39 – 48) were confined to knowledge that the braking system was “not very good” in the prime mover whereas the police inspection revealed that the defects in braking extended to the trailer. The applicant did say that he knew prior to the collision it was dangerous to drive a heavy vehicle with at least 18 tonne on it with the problems with the brakes and tyres about which he had told the interviewing police: see ERISP Q 295. 
     
      
    21 A fair reading of the ERISP, the applicant submits, discloses a belief that, while the braking system had faults, it essentially worked and points to QQ 41, 44. That submission to my mind understates the applicant’s comprehension of the insufficiencies of the vehicle he was driving. During the ERISP he was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q47. ….with such a, a load on the back, with the, the poor braking ability of the trailer….. 
        
       
      
     A. Yeah 
     
      
       
        
        Q47. ….how does that affect the, the driving ability of, of your load, how, in relation to the stopping distance……… 
        
       
       
        
        A. Stopping, fairly, well, yeah, probably, well, a fair bit, ‘cause that’s more, you know, that’s half the braking capacity of the truck, so, yeah, so, a fair bit.  
        
       
       
        
        Q48. Right. Do you think it was a dangerous thing to do to drive, drive the vehicle with the brakes in ……… 
        
       
      
     A. Yes, it was, yes.  
     
      
     Q48. …….Condition? 
     
      
     A. Yes.” 
     
      
    22 Later on during the ERISP the applicant was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q146. So, how did you know it was only the, the trailer brakes? 
        
       
       
        
        A. ‘Cause I, well I noticed it had been not stopping and I’ve looked underneath the trailer at the trailer brakes, noticed that the, the linings needed replacing………….” 
        
       
      
    23 And  
     
      
       
        
        “Q179. But, you, you as an experienced truck driver realised that there…… 
        
       
      
     A. Yeah. 
     
      
     Q179. ……was a problem there…….. 
     
      
     A. Yeah.  
     
      
     Q179. ……the brakes weren’t pulling you up properly? 
     
      
     A. Yes.” 
     
      
    The braking systems of the prime mover and trailer were connected.  
     
      
    24 It seems to me the word “full” in the remarks on sentence quoted above was used by the Judge to convey the applicant’s knowledge of the brake defects. I do not think that his Honour intended to attribute to the applicant total knowledge of the defects in the braking system and in the tyres. In any event, his Honour’s assessment of the moral culpability of the applicant was not confined to the extent of his knowledge of the defects in the vehicle. 25 The Judge said (ROS at 5): 
     
      
       
        
        “Objectively, the conduct of the offender on the occasion leading to these offences is most serious. This offender is one who, with knowledge that the semi-trailer was, by his own admission, dangerous, with defective brakes, was prepared to and did take it to Sydney on the F3, load 18 tons (sic) of freight and start to drive back to Newcastle on Friday about 4pm. This was at a time when the road would have carried a large amount of traffic. He knew the road so he was well aware of the gradients it contained. He was a disaster looking for a place to happen and happen it did. His conduct in behaving in the way that he did showed a complete disregard for the safety of other people whom he knew would at the time be travelling on the road, and shows a high degree of moral culpability.”  
        
       
      
    26 His Honour’s assessment of moral culpability properly included the applicant’s knowledge of braking deficiencies of the vehicle, the heavy load being carried, the extensive gradients on the freeway and the large volume of traffic likely to be encountered on a Friday at 4pm. The Judge, in my view, correctly described the moral culpability of the applicant as being of a “high degree”. 
     
      
    27 The applicant submits that the sentence imposed for manslaughter is significantly beyond the range of sentences imposed in cases of this type which is complicated by the Judge having effectively sentenced upon a ‘pre – Pearce’ basis and sentenced for manslaughter on a totality basis. His Honour, it is contended, has addressed the sentence for manslaughter as a whole by imposing in effect notional, symbolic sentences for the offences of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm on the basis that the overall sentence deals with a total criminality. 
     
      
    28 The sentence imposed for count 2 was a fixed term of two years and for count 3 a fixed term of eighteen months. Each sentence was expressed to be wholly concurrent with the non-parole period of eight years and balance of term of two years eight months for the count of manslaughter. The applicant acknowledges that the Judge may have accumulated the sentences on the dangerous driving counts and a total partial accumulation of not more than twelve months would be consistent with the principle expressed by this Court in Regina v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 and Ian Gobbet v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 46. 
     
      
    29 In Gobbet, Barr J with whom Mason P and Howie J agreed said [at 18]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As this Court observed in  
        R v Janceski 
         [2005] NSWCCA 288 where a court is sentencing for multiple offences arising out of a single criminal act, such as a count of driving as here, it is erroneous to impose concurrent sentences, each aggravated by consideration of the multiplicity of consequences. See also  
        R v Tadrosse 
         [2005] NSWCCA 145. The proper approach is to fix a sentence for each offence, without regard to the discrete effects of other offences, and then decide to what extent if any there should be accumulation in order to produce an overall result that reflects the totality of criminality:  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         (1998) 194 CLR 610.” 
        
       
      
    30 The Judge’s sentencing remarks indicate he was mindful of the obligation to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider the questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as totality: see Pearce at [45]. His Honour when rejecting the Crown’s contention founded on  
     
      
      s 21A(2)(m) Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act that an aggravating factor to be taken into account was that the offence involved multiple victims remarked (ROS at p 4): 
       
       
        
        “….and as to [(m)], the offender will be sentenced on three separate counts, each with a single victim.”  
        
       
       
      The Judge subsequently determined he did not believe that “..in light of the circumstances this is a proper case to accumulate sentences”  
      
    (ROS at p 6). 
     
      
    31 There is nothing to indicate in his Honour’s sentencing remarks that he inflated the sentence for the manslaughter by having regard to the effects of the dangerous driving offences nor that he had sentenced on a totality basis. The Judge was plainly aware that the maximum sentence for manslaughter was twenty five years whereas it was seven years for counts two and three. It was open to his Honour to determine that the counts other than the manslaughter be concurrent.  
     
      
    32 The applicant contends that a finding that the Judge did not sentence on a totality basis increases the complaint of manifest excess in the sentence for manslaughter. This sentence, it is submitted, was on its face a very heavy sentence for “motor vehicle manslaughter” which will be apparent if regard is had to comparable sentences. The applicant points to the plea of guilty and to the undiscounted starting points of the sentence.  
     
      
    33 The Judge said that the applicant entered his pleas at the “earliest time and is entitled to the full utilitarian discount” (ROS at p 3). His Honour was referring to the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty attracting a discount at the top of the range of 10-25 per cent: R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. At the conclusion of his sentencing remarks his Honour was asked by the Crown for clarification of the percentage discount for the utilitarian value of the plea which the Judge declined to provide. With respect to his Honour, whilst he was not obliged to specify the percentage of the discount, this Court continues to encourage sentencing Judges to make the process of giving credit for pleas of guilty transparent: R v Thomson; R v Houlton (supra) at [162], R v Lynn [2004] NSWCCA 222 at [14], R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 [at 16] and [17], R v Waqa (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 33 at [12] and [13]. 
     
      
    34 Applying to the head sentence of 10 years 8 months for manslaughter, a discount for the plea of 25 per cent, the notional starting point of the undiscounted sentence is 14 years and 3 months (rounded up to the next month). The notional starting points of the undiscounted sentence when discounts for the plea of 20 per cent or 15 per cent are applied are 13 years and 4 months and 12 years and 7 months (rounded up to the next month) respectively. The applicant contends that each of these starting points is excessive. 
     
      
    35 In Regina v Falzon [2000] NSWCCA 530 Smart AJ reviewed the cases to which the Court has been referred by the applicant and it is unnecessary to detail them here. Those cases reveal a range of sentences with a head term of 9 years and 4 months with a minimum term of 7 years being at the top: see R v Cramp (1999) NSWCCA 324. Cramp pleaded not guilty. Smart AJ observed [at para 47] however in Falzon that whilst he regarded the sentence imposed in Cramp as within the permissible range a “somewhat” higher sentence would also have been within that range.  
     
      
    36 In Falzon the appellant, a young man, was driving a stolen vehicle which was spotted by police and in the ensuing high speed chase a collision occurred in which a 17 year old boy lost his life. A sentence for manslaughter comprising a minimum term of 9 years and an additional term of 3 years was reduced on appeal as being manifestly excessive. A term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months was determined to be the correct sentence. Smart AJ [at para 47] with whom Beazley JA and Ireland AJ agreed took into account that the ‘appellant would have pleaded guilty, if he had been correctly advised”. His Honour remarked that counsel was not able to refer the Court to any case in which there was a sentence of 12 years (or more) with a non-parole period of 9 years for “motor manslaughter”.  
     
      
    37 The Crown points to what was said by Ipp J (then of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia) in R v McKenna (1992) 63 A Crim R 452 when his Honour observed (at p 465) that “criminality is not reduced because the crime can be characterised as ‘motor vehicle manslaughter’”. Seaman J (at p 462) in that case considered that a starting point of 16 years would not have been outside the range of a sound discretionary judgment bearing in mind that the maximum sentence in Western Australia for manslaughter is 20 years imprisonment. McKenna involved a collision causing death during a police pursuit of a stolen vehicle. 
     
      
    38 The maximum sentence in New South Wales for manslaughter is 25 years. 
     
      
    39 Whilst a consideration of sentences imposed by other Courts for the offence of manslaughter involving the use of a motor vehicle is helpful and promotes consistency in sentencing, it is for the Court to determine whether the sentence imposed in this case is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    40 Cases such as Falzon do not have the strong element of pre-meditation which is present in the applicant’s case. The applicant knew that the braking system of his prime mover and tri-axle flat bed trailer was defective and tyres were worn. Cognizant of those deficiencies, he entered into a commercial transaction to travel a lengthy journey from Newcastle to Sydney to pick up a load of timber and building materials weighing approximately 18 tonne and to return. He was aware that the increased load would further diminish the vehicle’s ability to stop, yet he embarked on the return journey. His cognisance included the significant variations in the gradient of the F3 freeway and the high speed at which vehicles travelled upon that road. He knew of the steep descent to the Mooney Mooney bridge and that large volumes of traffic would be encountered on a Friday afternoon at 4pm. He was alive to the possibility that he may be required to slow his heavy vehicle and trailer from a high speed. The applicant was conscious of the danger of driving the heavily laden vehicle but chose to do so for commercial gain. He deliberately disregarded the safety of other road users in circumstances which involved a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow. He was, using his Honour’s parlance, “a disaster looking for a place to happen and happen it did”.  
     
      
    41 The taking of a human life in the present circumstances is a very serious crime. The applicant’s conduct involved a high degree of criminality. It is to be clearly understood that manslaughter is no less serious a crime because it is committed by the use of a motor vehicle.  
     
      
    42 His Honour correctly referred to the need to deter other persons prepared to “blatantly disregard the safety of other users of the road and behave as the offender did” (ROS at p 6). An important consideration in this case is the element of general deterrence. Heavily laden vehicles compete daily with non-commercial traffic on busy roads. The consequences of driving an unsafe heavy vehicle can be horrendous as is demonstrated by the mass destruction in this case. The sentence should plainly indicate to an operator of a heavy vehicle that safety cannot be sacrificed for financial reasons.  
     
      
    43 Appropriate weight was given by the Judge to the subjective circumstances of the applicant.  
     
      
    44 I am not persuaded that the notional undiscounted starting points of the sentence for manslaughter were excessive. In my view, the applicant’s sentence was at the top of the range of an appropriate sentence. I am unable to find that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    45 I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

    SENTENCE1 On 18 June 2005, three businessmen and a businesswoman sat down at a Korean restaurant in Strathfield for what was to be a convivial social connection as each sought to network and consolidate their contacts within the tourist industry. Carlos Robinson was at the dinner. He had not previously met the petite and attractive woman. The males were all Korean, she was Japanese. 2 Alcohol flowed freely, perhaps too freely among them. Well into the night, the female feeling as though she may be ill, made her way to the toilet lest she be sick in front of the men. Of the two toilets, the lady's toilet was occupied. She opened the door to the men’s toilet, it was empty. She made her way inside. Within two or three minutes, Carlos Robinson made his way to the toilet. He too was well affected by alcohol. Whilst in the toilet, something happened. 3 The female claimed to the other men she had been sexually assaulted by him. He denied that was so. Between 20 and 30 November, he was tried upon two charges of having sexual intercourse with her without her consent. His defence was that it was he who had been sexually assaulted by her.4 The jury found him guilty to the second count in the indictment, an allegation of enforced fellatio. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. 5 As sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this Court committed by this offender harming this victim in this community (See Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1 SCR 688 at [80].6 My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. 7 When a jury has given a verdict, it is open to the trial judge to make findings of fact so long as those findings of fact are consistent with the verdict rendered by the jury. The facts do not have to be those most favourable to the accused, nor those most against his interests, but rather, the findings of fact the judge feels are appropriate in the light of the jury verdict.8 The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will need to be assessed even if looking at the future through a glass darkly. Before any final sentence can be determined, there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, whether the offence attracts a standard non parole period and if so, the length of the parole period, whether special circumstances are to be found and to the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment that is to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus, the protection of the community will also need to be determined (see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329; R v Rushby [1977] 1NSWLR 594 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740). FACTS9 The complainant worked at a Duty Free shop located near the Quay. On 17 June, she and her boss JC had an after work drink at a bar at Circular Quay. JC received a call from Carlos Robinson insisting, as acquaintances sometimes can, that he come to Strathfield to meet at a local Korean restaurant where food and alcohol were available. The complainant who did not know Carlos Robinson willingly went along with her boss. I am satisfied she did so to widen her contacts within the tourist industry and because she was enjoying the evening thus far. 10 At Strathfield, she was introduced to Carlos Robinson and his companion. All four took a table towards the rear of the restaurant. In making their way from the front to their table, they passed the male and female toilets. Each toilet was adjacent to the other. Entry was gained to each by its own door, the doors were close to each other. 11 Throughout the night, the four consumed some Korean noodles, but mainly drank. Significantly, the accused occupied JC in conversation, spoken in Korean, a language with which the complainant was not familiar. Robinson’s companion Yoon Mo Sung had reasonable fluency in English. He engaged the complainant in conversation. As I earlier referred, there came a point where the complainant needed to go to the toilet. The suju was having an effect upon her. She was feeling very sick. She thought she was about to throw up. 12 She moved from the table to the female toilet, it was occupied. At that time there were but a few patrons remaining at the restaurant. She moved over to the male toilet. On the left wall of that toilet was a urinal and in the rear left corner was a sink. Adjacent to the sink was a toilet bowl. The toilet was empty. She made her way to the toilet bowl and bent over it. She remained there for some moments.13 At some point her attention was drawn by the opening of the door to Mr Robinson’s arrival. I cannot ascertain what precisely the complainant was doing at the time he walked in, but I regard it as most likely that she was washing her hands. She said to the offender “I’m sorry, I know this is a male toilet, so I am leaving.” 14 Mr Robinson was well affected by alcohol. He had entered the toilet to urinate and immediately commenced to do so either reckless or oblivious as to whether that conduct would embarrass or offend the complainant. It is likely the complainant’s hands were wet, she may have taken a moment to dry them. I am satisfied though that she did ultimately attempt to leave.15 Robinson blocked her path pushing her backwards with both hands. She fell backward against the toilet bowl. He moved forward touching firstly her shoulder and then her breast, using his right hand. The initial touching occurred on the outside of her clothing. He then moved his hand inside her clothing and bra touching her on her left breast, squeezing it. She pushed back and tried to escape. He brought his face close to her face and neck and tried to kiss her on the lips and neck. He undid the zipper and catch of her pants and they fell to her ankles. He pulled her underpants downwards. She hung onto them hoisting them upwards. She said to him in English “Go away”. He was touching all of her body. With his body, he pushed her backwards a second time. Her back hit the wall and she sunk towards the floor. Carlos Robinson unzipped his pants or loosened them and exposed his penis. His penis was flaccid, meaning soft, he tried to place it in the complainant’s mouth, she moved her face, she did not want his penis in her mouth.16 His penis came closer and closer to her mouth. She called out for help. Her head was against the wall, she could retreat no further. As she moved her face from right to left, she realised she could not avoid his penis any further. She felt there was no way out. She put his penis into her mouth. It was still flaccid. She does not recall if it became erect. I imagine it is very likely she would have remembered had it become erect. She does not remember the penis moving in and out of her mouth. She claims she bit the penis, not to injure him, but hard enough to encourage him to withdraw it.17 Robinson communicated his feelings and commands in Korean. At one stage the door was opened by JC looking for the complainant. The offender barked out a single word, probably “What?”. JC immediately closed the door without seeing the complainant. That opening of the door must have occurred at a time when the offender was blocking a direct view of the complainant. I am satisfied the door was only partially open and remained open but for an instant. I am satisfied JC never had a full view of the toilet. It is unlikely his view passed the centre line of the room. 18 Although the complainant felt the act of fellatio lasted a long time, it is unlikely to have lasted as long as a minute. Once the door had opened, the offender stopped, the complainant gathered herself and left immediately. She made a bee line to the table where JC and the other man were sitting. She said “That guy just tried to rape me”. As she was complaining, the offender returned. She struck out at him with her foot. It is likely she connected with the accused’s shins or legs. The accused resumed his seat, the complainant and the other two ultimately made their way from the restaurant.OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS19 From the facts as he finds them to be, a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this case with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in that way that the seriousness of this criminal activity can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact on the overall sentence to be set.20 A useful starting point in the assessment of objective criminality in sexual assault cases is to remind the Court of part of a judgment of Mahoney JA, as he then was.  
     
      
      “As I have indicated, every offence of this kind is a serious offence. But those whose duty it is to deal with crimes of this kind, and to sentence those who commit them, know that though each case is inherently serious, some are more serious than others. In some cases, the degree of violence, physical hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation and otherwise are much greater than involved [in other cases]. It is to be understood that in sentencing, it is appropriate - indeed in most cases it is necessary - that the sentencing judge form and record his assessment of where on the relevant scale of seriousness, the particular offence lies.” ( 
      R v Gebrail 
       unreported NSWCCA 18 November 1994) 
      
    21 In 1993, the then chief justice, Justice Gleeson, made the point that non consensual intercourse is an extreme form of violence and one which the community expects courts to take very seriously (R v Hartikainen unreported NSWCCA 8 June 1993) even if no additional violence is administered other than the intercourse (R v Pay [1999] NSWCCA 40 at [7]). Unwanted forced intrusion into the privacy, indeed the intimacy of a complainant’s body and psyche against her will by use of physical power and callous disregard of her wishes or feelings marks the essence of criminality of sexual intercourse without consent type offences.22 The crown seeks a finding that this offence falls into a mid range of seriousness for offences of this kind. The defence argues that it falls below that point. 23 The crown has drawn my attention to R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434. For the purposes of assessing the objective criminality in the instant case, I draw from AJPthe following guidelines. 
     
     That the offence is an isolated incident is not irrelevant to its evaluation for purposes of assessing whether it is in the mid range. 
     Where an offence is defined in the statute to include several categories of conduct, the heinousness of the conduct in a particular case depends not upon the statute defining the offence, or the particular category of conduct, but upon the facts of the case, of which the nature of intercourse will be but one factor that will determine the seriousness of the offence. 
     While penile vaginal penetration may well be more serious than enforce fellatio, it does not mean fellatio must necessarily fall below the mid point of seriousness. 
     Section 21A matters of aggravation will be matters that may lift a matter to or beyond the mid point of seriousness.  
     Other matters that may impact upon objective seriousness include how the offence took place, the span of time over which an offence occurred, the degree of force or coercion applied to the complainant, the use of threats before or after the criminal intercourse to ensure compliance with demands made and/or subsequent silence, the level of physical and other harm done to the complainant. 
    24 The crown puts the objective seriousness of the offence thus. 
     
      
      “The offence committed by the offender was a brazen violation of the complainant in circumstances where the offender detained the complainant in the toilet and forced himself upon her. Thereafter, the offender brushed aside the complainant’s resistance, fondled her indecently and pushed her into the rear of the toilet so that in the end, the complainant was left with no effective choice except to have the offender’s penis placed in her mouth. Nothing justified the action of the offender. The fact that the complainant was in the male toilet or that she was affected to some degree by alcohol did not entitle the offender to force himself upon the complainant. Although the complainant had met the offender that night in the restaurant, her social contact with him was limited. Nothing in this previous contact explains or mitigates the actions of the offender.” 
      
    25 I am prepared to accept the accuracy of the crown’s assessment as an obvious starting point in assessing the objective criminality. 26 The defence has sought to mitigate the seriousness of the offence by seeking findings of fact that include: 
     
     Alcohol was involved in the commission of the offence. 
     The offender had no control over the circumstances that placed the complainant in the men’s toilet. 
     The victim walked into the men’s toilet of her own accord. 
     The victim did not leave immediately upon the offender entering the toilet. 
     The degree of physical force used was towards the lower end of the scale 
     The victim places the offender’s penis into her mouth and commenced to suck it through a combination of fear and having nowhere else to move. 
     The offence took place over a relatively short period of time. 
     The offence was not premeditated. 
    27 I have already recognised that this is an offence in which alcohol played its part. The complainant’s sickness was alcohol induced, the offender’s impaired judgment, skills and dis-inhibition owe their origin to alcohol. The offence was opportunistic. The complainant was not confronted until after she was in the male toilet. However, her presence in the male toilet did not provide some reason for this offender to treat her with disrespect or humiliate her. Her presence in the male toilet gave him no right or permission to abuse her sexually or in any other way. To couch a submission suggesting she is somehow contributing to her sexual attack by not evacuating the toilet immediately is based upon a misconception. There can be no circumstance arising out of her slowness of departure that created any entitlement or provided any mitigation for the sexual assault upon her. 28 The level of physical force is towards the lower end. There were two occasions when he pushed the complainant, otherwise he crowded her and mauled her. I have no doubts that the complainant found his size and stature threatening. I have no doubt she found his activity with his hands also threatening. 29 I am satisfied his tone was at very best dismissive of her. On the other hand, the level of force used, particularly when sexual connection itself occurred, was more subdued. This was not a case where the complainant’s head is forced and held onto the offender’s penis by some vice-like grip. This is not a case where an erection is thrust deep into the complainant’s mouth forcing her to gag. In fact, there is no evidence of any erection. This is not a case where a stream of degrading threats and insults are spat at the complainant. This is not a case where ejaculation into the complainant’s mouth, face or body is forced upon her by an offender. In fact, there is no evidence of ejaculation.30 The offence is said to take place over a short period. I have found the act of fellatio was probably less than a minute, but it was interrupted. It would be unrealistic though to ignore the proceeding minutes when the offender satisfied himself he could do as he willed with the complainant. That having been said, the whole episode is to be measured in minutes rather than quarter hours or even longer time frames. 31 This offence was not part of some longer series of events either over past times or within the criminal activity. While the complainant was well affected by alcohol and momentarily alone, and in that sense at her most vulnerable, she was not otherwise a vulnerable person. 32 I note that there was some racial overtones in remarks made by the offender towards the complainant, but I cannot be satisfied the offence was motivated by race. It was motivated by something else, but lack of respect for the Japanese lowered the barrier of respect normally accorded to all women. 33 In all the circumstances, this is not an offence reaching the mid range of seriousness on its objective facts. Nor, however, is it a trivial example of Section 61I offences. I would place it at a point where it is best described as approaching a mid range without having reached that point, that is, slightly below the mid range of seriousness.SUBJECTIVE MATTERS34 I turn now to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for this criminal offence, but I am also sentencing this offender for it. 35 Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender, or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. FAMILY BACKGROUND AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS36 Carlos Robinson is a forty one year old (thirty nine at the time of the offence) married man. He was born in South Korea as Sang Woo Jeon. In 1998, he changed his name after arriving in New Zealand to Carlos Robinson for reasons associated with his business interest in tourism. His choice of name honoured a close friend and was an attempt by him to integrate into the New Zealand culture. He has two younger siblings and a mother still living in South Korea. He met his wife in 1994 while working as a tour guide in New Zealand. Initially they established a long distance relationship. They married in Sydney in 2002. By this time he had been living in Australia for two years. 37 In Sydney, he has been active within the Korean community, most of his contacts would be Korean. Neither he nor his wife have family in Sydney. His father-in-law passed away in 2006. His own father had died earlier in 1997 when he was aged thirty one. He had good relations with his parents, they were supportive and loving. He was not exposed to domestic violence, physical or sexual abuse. He has good relationships with his siblings. He has had four relationships, the longest lasting seven or eight years. He has lived with his wife since 2002. She has remained strongly supportive of him.EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT HISTORY38 Carlos Robinson did his schooling in Korea, he was an above average student. He had and maintained friendships within the school. He interacted well with teachers. After leaving school, he completed a Bachelor of Science in 1991 from Danbook University. Thereafter he worked as a software engineer for one year. He was posted to Auckland as a software engineer but resigned, returned to South Korea, applied for permanent residence to New Zealand, and returned to New Zealand from Korea in 1993. That year he began to work in New Zealand as a tour guide for incoming Korean tourists. He ran his own touring company between 1994 and 1997. That business closed in 1997. He commenced study at Auckland University of Technology for a Diploma of Tourism and Travel which he apparently completed in 2000. He immigrated to Australia in 2000 to make a new start. He remained in tourism beginning again as a tour guide. Since October 2003, he has been the general manager of Oriental Express Tour and Travel Services Pty Ltd. .An overview of his work is as marketing manager and tour operator. Those who know of him through work speak of him having skills in that area.GENERAL HEALTH39 He presents in Court as a man of average height, although overweight for it. In 1991 he was involved in a motor vehicle accident. One of the sequela of that accident was a number of injuries requiring surgical intervention.40 Impotence, as events turned out, was a lasting injury. It was though, a condition that varied in intensity. On occasions he would achieve an erection, but he never achieved a full erection. His wife was aware of his impotence when they married. As a consequence of his ongoing impotence and their desire for children his sex life with his wife was less than satisfactory. After marriage he became increasingly depressed and no doubt stressed.41 Between December 2004 and June 2005 he and his wife attended IVF clinics without success. They focused on three cycles, the last of which was in June 2005. There was re-emergence of depressive mood, reduced appetite, weight loss, reduced energy, motivation, concentration and sleep disturbance at that time. There was increase of alcohol consumption.42 He also suffers from diabetes mellitus for which he has been prescribed Diamicron. He has had a tumour removed from his adrenal glands in 2003. He had injuries to his jaw and right hip as a consequence of the motor vehicle accident. He suffered injuries to his urethra which caused difficulties in urination. Whether they have been resolved or not is not established on the evidence. MENTAL HEALTH43 I have made reference to his depressive mood for which he has been prescribed Luvox. Since verdict there has been at least one serious incident of suicidal ideation; the plan being to commit suicide together with his wife. Each has participated in some mutual self harming, grieving ritual by banging their heads on the concrete in their kitchen with a view to killing themselves.44 Since verdict he has become anxious. At times he was panicked at work, experiencing symptoms of palpitation, shortness of breath lasting five to six minutes and occurring four to five times daily. 45 Dr Allnut, a forensic psychiatrist retained by defence, does not think though that this amounts to panic disorder. In his culture “face” and presentation to others appears to have far deeper significance than may be the general case in western culture. Shame and dishonour of a criminal offender will have more widespread recognition and a more judgmental recognition throughout his community embracing even members of his family than is so in western cultures.46 This loss of intrinsic respect generally given to others has contributed decidedly to the depression he was already experiencing. His wife’s predicament being also captured by this loss of family standing has also added to his depression. He and his wife have been seeking psychological counselling since the beginning of 2007, Dr Kim PhD, a psychologist, diagnosing his depression as severe.ALCOHOL ISSUES47 Carlos Robinson’s drug of choice is hard alcohol (Soju) a Korean saki and VB beer. He first drank alcohol aged twenty-two. In the past three years it has increased to twelve VBs daily. He denies he has an alcohol problem. Those who know him will not acknowledge he has a problem, whether for fear of offending him or seeming to be impolite I cannot tell. I am satisfied he was well affected by alcohol on this night. It is likely he contacted the two other males as much for drinking company as for networking.48 He claims alcohol has not impacted significantly on his interpersonal relationships or occupation. He does, however, have two prior criminal convictions relating to alcohol: refuse breath tests in March 2004 and low range PCA in August 2005. There is evidence that on other occasions he has slept in his car because he has drunk too much to drive. CIRCUMSTANCES MOTIVATING HIS OFFENDING BEHAVIOUR49 At thirty-nine this offence appears to be entirely out of character. His psycho-sexual history as given to Dr Allnut appears conservative enough. His first sexual experience was at twenty. He has had two sexual partners both female. He identifies as heterosexual. He denies any deviant or aberrant fantasies, urges or behaviours. Violence has not previously played any part in his sexual behaviour.50 I am satisfied he is one of those Koreans who does hold Japanese in no regard. On his account the complainant was the aggressor. In the course of aggression he said to her, “Get out you fucking Japanese”. I am reminded that the complainant does not give this evidence. I am satisfied he did utter the words “Get out”. I am also satisfied however that the phrase “you fucking Japanese” does reflect a racial bias against Japanese. In that sense they [Japanese] are less worthy of respect as to the physical and sexual integrity than others may be.51 At the time of this offence he and is wife were struggling with impotency issues focusing on an IVF program and the high personal cost to both of them around the non-conception of a child. The only sense that I can make of this incident is that there must have been some nexus - anger, frustration, desire to combat his impotence, resentment at the need continually to perform sexually on command - between him, his criminal conduct and the sexual issues within his marriage.52 However, in the light of his defence his motive can only remain one of speculation. I am satisfied his inhibition and judgment skills were adversely affected by his alcoholic condition. It is unlikely he would have embarked upon this first time course of conduct if he was not striving to obtain an erection and of course the other consequences of fellatio.53 Significantly when he presented his penis to the complainant’s mouth it was not erect. The evidence is silent on whether it ever became erect. In the circumstances of this case I would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt it did so, as I earlier said I cannot be so satisfied.ATTITUDE TO THE OFFENCE54 There is a serious unwillingness to recognise his conduct as offending. That may have origin in the immense loss of face to him, his wife and family as a consequence of such admission. It may also relate to the derogatory view he holds of the complainant. Dr Allnut opines [he] “manifests extreme minimisation and denial of sexual offence”. As I see it he has done that by creating his own sexual fantasy that she came on to him because she was impressed with his sexual equipment.CHARACTER AND CRIMINAL HISTORY55 Prior to June 2005 this offender had led a productive and valuable life. He was responsible for bringing many tourists to Australia and showing them sights of beauty in Sydney and perhaps beyond. No doubt he also explained some of the cultural values of Australia to his Korean tourists. 56 Father Gabriel Scong Kyoun Youn regards this offence as being out of character. He has presented at the Korean Martyrs and St Stanislaw’s Catholic Church as a man of deep faith, strong sense of justice, honest and responsible. Father Gabriel reports him as making many contributions to the church community and being helpful to others.57 A work colleague Daniel Sung speaks of him giving cruising parties to senior citizens with Captain Cook Cruises. He speaks of other charitable works being undertaken by Robinson. He describes Carlos Robinson as a man of integrity, extremely dedicated to his family. Sung regarded this offence as out of character. 58 Nak Yoon Pak spoke of the offender’s charitable work among the Korean community. Within the community he has an excellent reputation. He wrote of the offender overcoming business hardships in New Zealand, studying and succeeding. He too regarded the offence as being out of character. 59 The only matters of prior trouble with the law are the two alcohol matters earlier referred to. Given his prior character and antecedents he is entitled to some mitigation of penalty when the final sentencing disposition is determined. REHABILITATION PROSPECTS60 On the positive side: 
     
     The offence seen by those who know him as being out of character. It is his first and only significant criminal offence in forty-one years. 
     Dr Allnut reviewing the available information both actuarial and from history and objective facts assesses the risk of future sexual recidivism as a low/moderate one. 
     Robinson has strong support from his wife and his family although the family are in South Korea. 
     The offender has expressed to Dr Allnut a willingness to pursue intervention for his sexual difficulties. 
     Likewise he is prepared to pursue drug and alcohol counselling. 
     He has extensive experience, qualifications and skill within the tourist industry. While the evidence before me suggests that it may be difficult for him to find acceptance within the Korean community organising as part of the Korean community tours to Australia, he still has much to offer. An Australian based tourist organisation with his Korean connections is a distinct possibility that could suit both him and that Australian tourist organisation. 
    61 There are matters that may suggest more caution in assessing his rehabilitation.  
     
     It is likely his problem with impotence will continue if not worsen.  
     I have seen some nexus, although not clearly identified, between his own personal sexual problems and the offence as one of several factors that had input into his offending conduct. 
     He has sought to minimise his criminal conduct through the creation of some sexual fantasy in which his potential for sexual prowess is magnified. 
     In court he has not recognised his drinking problem. To date he appears to have done nothing about it. Frankly it does not appear to me that he is getting much assistance from his network or contacts in the Korean community in respect of his drinking problem or any encouragement from them to diminish it. I accept that may be a cultural issue. If it be so I am at a loss to understand it. 
    62 Overall I am prepared to assess his risk of offending as Dr Allnut did, low/moderate.HARDSHIP TO MRS ROBINSON63 Ms Ocampo, counsel appearing on sentence although not retained at the trial, submitted this was a case of extraordinary hardship falling upon Mrs Na, wife of the offender, as a consequence of his impending imprisonment. Ms Na attended each day of the trial. That ordeal could only have been highly stressful for her as she heard the allegations made by the crown and complainant and the evidence of the complainant.64 The conviction of her husband on the second and more serious count on the indictment could only have been traumatic for her. The time between trial and sentence I recognise as emotional turmoil for them both.65 Her closeness to her husband, her remoteness from her family still in Korea, her sense of dishonour accumulating to her as a consequence of the jury verdict, her compassion for her husband’s inevitable fate of imprisonment, her personal response of denial of the only outcome available, that is, incarceration, has brought on an emotional response of depression, weeping, emptiness and sense of abandonment.66 Her husband is well aware of her hardships both since the verdict and to come. That of course will make his incarceration the more difficult for him. He cannot be with her to support her. I am satisfied she presents as vulnerable, depressed and emotionally raw. There has been evidence led of her deep depression and her incapacity to cope. 67 One of the consequences of offending is the devastation it causes to wives and children of the offender. They too become victims of the offender’s criminal conduct. Much as the Court may feel for the grieving and distress a faithful and loving wife may feel when she is separated from her husband by prison walls, the Court’s duty lies in impartially dealing with offenders unless the circumstances be exceptional.68 I accept that her depression has been deep, but the evidence suggests that it may abate. I am sure that once things settle down after incarceration commences it will abate. Her concern as to continuation of the IVF program could not have been certain even without the jury verdict. As with other programs the progress and suitability of candidates would need to be reassessed after each episode.69 There has been as I understand it no further IVF attempts in the almost two years since the last program. Even if the complainant’s psychological condition was not to improve I would not regard the circumstances as sufficiently exceptional to an extent where I would mitigate the otherwise appropriate sentence on her account. 70 There is concern that Ms Na’s income stream will disappear when her husband is incarcerated. That regrettably is a cost of the punitive paradigm for serious criminal offending that operates in this State. It has been well supported by appeal courts for several centuries in this and English jurisdictions.71 Ms Na was regarded as a successful businesswoman in Korea. While she has not worked in Australia and believes she will have difficulty gaining employment, neither of those propositions has been proved. I am satisfied the evidence establishes that the present situation is unlikely to last throughout the offender’s incarceration. 72 Chief Justice Gleeson when dealing with the same subject that I have been dealing with in these sentencing proceedings turned to a judgment which he described as the most frequently cited judgment in Australia, that of Wells J in R v Wirth (1976) 14 SASR 291 at 295-96. What Justice Wells said was this: 
     
      
      “Hardship to spouse, family, and friends, is the tragic, but inevitable, consequence of almost every conviction and penalty recorded in a criminal court... It seems to me that courts would often do less than their clear duty - especially where the element of retribution, deterrence, or protection of society is the predominant consideration - if they allowed themselves to be much influenced by the hardship that prison sentences, which from all other points of view were justified, would be likely to cause to those near and dear to prisoners. But it has been often remarked that the strength of our law lies in the willingness of judges, when applying a principle, not to carry it past the point where a sense of mercy or of affronted common sense imperatively demands that they should draw back. So it is proper that I should here add, in my opinion, hardship likely to be caused by a sentence of imprisonment under consideration ought to be taken into account where the circumstances are highly exceptional, where it would be, in effect, inhuman to refuse to do so... For example, if it were demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that to send a man to prison would, without much doubt, drive his wife to suicide, it would be a steely-hearted judge who did not, however illogically, at least try to meet the situation by suitably framed orders as to penalty. But further than that, in my judgment, courts should not go.” 
      
    73 I have reviewed the evidence. I am satisfied as I say that I do not believe the matter is as Justice Wells referred to it in Wirth. In this case there has been, as earlier referred to, suicidal ideation exhibited by Ms Na. To her credit she has been seeking counselling. There has been some improvement. I have observed her in court. It is obvious to me she has found the sentencing proceedings very distressing, she is frequently weeping.74 The factors driving her depression though are multifactorial. While one factor, the loss of her husband to incarceration, is one and a poignant one, there are others. The loss of opportunity to pursue another round of IVF, her concern as to a loss of income stream, her sense of isolation in the community. The loss of her husband to incarceration will be for a substantial period, but it is far from permanent. Other factors causing the depression can be dealt with.75 She has a family in Korea who would be supportive of her and so far as I can gather the resources to return to them for a period while she recovers her health. The tension competing with Ms Na’s needs, needs to be resolved by the Court taking into account the objective seriousness of the offence for which her husband stands and the associated need for retribution, deterrence and protection of the community that more modern legal authority still regards as being achieved by incarceration.SETTING THE SENTENCE76 This is an offence in which general deterrence must be applied. That is so because sexual assault offences occur in a vast variety of situations and it would seem, such as this one, sometimes by persons acting out of character. General deterrence is aimed at persons who breach the criminal law recognised they do so at their peril.77 For an offence falling within a mid-range of seriousness there is a standard non-parole period of seven years. NO STANDARD NON-PAROLE PERIOD 78 The objective circumstances of the offence have been found to fall slightly below the mid-range of seriousness. There is nothing to be found in the subjective features which elevates the offence into one falling within the mid-range of seriousness. This is not a matter that attracts the standard non-parole period.79 That having been said, however, I must bear in mind that the standard non-parole period will have the effect of driving upwards what previously would have been an appropriate sentence for this offence. BALANCING THE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE FACTORS80 This was as the crown catalogued a brazen violation of the complainant’s person and intimacy. On any view sexual intercourse without consent is an offence of violence. In this case the complainant was detained against her will while she was sexually assaulted. 81 The offender is now forty-one years old. To date he has made a useful contribution to the community through a generally law-abiding life. 82 Even though I have determined this offence below the mid-range of seriousness I am required to recognise the standard non-parole period as a reference point and benchmark for offences falling within the mid-range where an accused has been found guilty after trial and gauge the sentence I set for this offence bearing that benchmark in mind.83 I have determined the overall sentence to be one of four and a half years. That is the minimum sentence that could be given in the circumstances of this case. 84 Special circumstances have been found for the following reasons: 
     
     This is his first time in custody. 
     His custody will be more arduous for him because he is Korean, speaks little English and will at forty-one be older than a prison population that is predominantly English speaking, western culture and aged eighteen to twenty-five. 
     His wife has serious depression issues that have to be discussed in some detail. His awareness of her psychological situation together with the knowledge that he has contributed significantly to it will make his custody time the more arduous. 
     Generally his rehabilitation prospects are better advanced in the community.  
     Sex offender programs in custody are sometimes accessed when the offender becomes eligible for parole. In his case the sooner they are accessed the better for him. It is important to have treatment closer to the offending to which it relates. Its chances of being efficacious are far greater if the course has immediate relevance rather than a requirement to be completed before parole is given. That is not to say there would be no value in some booster program as the offender prepares himself for release. 
     He has health problems including type 2 diabetes. 
    85 Would you stand up please, Mr Robinson? Carlos Robinson, I convict you of the offence that you on or about 18 June at Strathfield had sexual intercourse with A..N. without her consent knowing that she was not consenting. I sentence you to a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from today 30 March 2007 and to expire on 29 September 2009. I set a balance of term of two years to expire on 29 September 2011. 86 The first date upon you will become eligible to be released to parole will be 29 September 2009. I order that your warrant be marked “depressed and a possible suicide risk”. 87 The decision to release you to parole is not one that I take or the Court takes but is a decision of the Parole Board. Before the Parole Board releases you to parole it will review the progress that you have made in prison. If you make good progress in prison and in particular if you are able to complete the sex offenders’ program in prison before your eligibility date it is likely you would be released to parole on time. If you do not make progress in prison your chances of being released on the due parole date become weaker.

     OVERTURNED ON CROWN APPEAL - see  
     R V THOMAS 
      [2007] NSWCCA 269 
    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: On his way home from work on 12 April 2005 Vasanthan Kandiah took a short cut across a portion of the Parramatta Golf Course. He had travelled some fifty metres along a pedestrian path. He still had some short distance to walk before he reached the Parramatta Rugby Union Club. His journey was interrupted by four youths who robbed him.2 Matthew Ryan Thomas, a young man then approaching his twenty-first birthday, was one of the youths. He was charged with robbery in company. He denied he was a robber. After an eight day trial a jury found him guilty.3 A little over a month earlier than this offence Kiaron Mucullough made his way to a Telstra payphone opposite the Bendigo Bank in the Parramatta street mall. While at the payphone he was talking to his brother. Earlier he had consumed a large quantity of alcohol. He had also purchased three 750ml bottles of beer. One was opened and he was consuming its contents. Whilst at the phone booth he was approached by a young man who claimed he wanted the phone. Words were exchanged Mucullough became scared and ran from the phone. Some minutes later he was brutally robbed by two men, one of whom was the same man who frightened Mucullough whilst he was calling. That man, again, was Matthew Ryan Thomas. Worse, that man was responsible for wounding Mucullough. Matthew Thomas pleaded guilty to the aggravated robbery of Kiaron Mucullough. 4 Today, Matthew Thomas, is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct as reflected in these two offences. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for these two offences before this court committed by this offender harming these two victims within this community. (See R v Gladue [1999] 1 SRC 688 at [80].5 My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of each offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessment requires the sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to these offences and to this offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking at the future through a glass darkly.6 Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, totality, the length of the parole periods and finally, of course, the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment that is to be imposed. None of those matters can be addressed until the primary facts are determined. What weight will need to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus, the protection of the community, will also need to be determined. (see: R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 594 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740).THE FACTS IN RELATION TO THE VASANTHAN KANDIAH ROBBERY7 Looking at the robbery of Mr Kandiah, which I will call the Kandiah robbery, the facts as I find them to be are these: Mr Kandiah was walking home from work. He had joined the path across the golf course from Argyle Street. That path is a hundred and fifty metres across the park or golf course. He had walked, as I said, about fifty metres of it. He saw four youths approach from his left. They made their way to a bench which was some distance in front of him. That bench was next to the footpath. He was approaching close to that bench with his mobile phone in his hand as he walked. He had already become concerned, fearful and dialled Triple 0 to seek the police. I cannot be satisfied that the call he sought to make was in fact connected.8 One of the youths came from the bench. When two to three metres from him the youth asked for a two dollar coin. Kandiah said, “I have no change.” The youth abused him using foul language and racial slurs. Kandiah stopped. The youth grabbed his jacket and continued swearing and abusing him. 9 Another youth pulled the mobile phone from his hand, looked at the mobile phone and began pressing buttons. There was a conversation to the effect that the Triple 0 was on the screen. By this time there were two or three males standing on his left. 10 Another youth in that group who had a baseball cap on pulled the mobile phone from the hands of the youth who first had it. He too commenced playing with the phone. 11 Kandiah sought to continue walking on; however, the four youths were encircling him. He made no more than four to five metres. A youth grabbed his jacket, Kandiah turned to face that youth, in so doing he was facing the direction from which he had come. The abuse continued. A youth put his arms completely around Kandiah. Kandiah could smell alcohol and the smell that reminded him of vomit. It may well be that his sense of smell was right because I am satisfied the youths had been drinking. He sought to push that youth away with his left hand. Four or five times he pushed. The youth did not go away. Kandiah then pushed him harder driving that youth two to three metres back. 12 Another youth, on the crown case the offender, said, “Excuse me, you’ve just hurt my friend.” Mr Kandiah replied, “I didn’t mean to hurt your friend, I just pushed him away.” There was exchange between Kandiah and the accused who Kandiah said spoke aggressively. Kandiah tried to brush them off saying, ‘I didn’t hurt your friend, just go away.” 13 The accused raised his right fist, drew it back and struck Kandiah in the cheek just below his left eye. Kandiah was dizzy, could see nothing and was knocked to the ground. In so saying I am not confident that he was knocked flat to the ground, but certainly to his knees. He tried to stand up after a moment or two. He called out, “Help”. He turned to face all four youths. He was rushed. He put his arms in a defensive position to protect his head. He was driven back four or five metres. He was hit from his front and on his right. His jacket was grabbed and pulled and in the course of that occurring his arms were forced back and with the strain the jacket slipped from his arms. 14 He was pushed so that he fell to the ground. As he tried to get up he was kicked, he fell back to the ground, used his arms to protect his head. He was kicked along the right side of his body. He had difficulty breathing. The abuse was continuing. One of the youths however was screaming, “Where’s your wallet, where's your wallet.” With all the noise going on another said, “Stop, he can’t hear you”. The demand for the wallet was repeated. Kandiah directed the youths to the briefcase. The briefcase was found and taken. It was later found elsewhere in the golf course. His wallet was missing. Once the case was taken there was quiet for a while. Kandiah managed to get to his feet. Disorientated, he realised he had been robbed. He saw the youths some distance away. He made his way to Parramatta Rugby Union Club and reported the robbery.15 The physical injuries to Mr Kandiah as a consequence of his treatment at the hands of the robbers included bruising and pain from being kicked over his body. The lining of the skin of his mouth and his cheeks and lips were all injured. I will return to the topic of his psychological injuries in particular when I deal with the victim impact report from him. THE FACTS IN RELATION TO THE ROBBERY OF KIARON MUCULLOUGH16 The crown tendered a series of allegations which it labelled ‘facts’. Many of these allegations were not disputed but crucial ones were. Evidence was led from the victim, the offender and a co-offender named McLennan. I intend firstly to read out the facts as I find them to be and thereafter explain how it is that I determined some of the disputed facts adversely to the offender.17 On 2 March 2005 Kiaron Mucullough spent a considerable time at the Parramatta Hotel playing pool with friends and drinking. Some time after 8.30 he bought three long-neck bottles of VB. He walked from the pub through the Church Street Mall towards North Parramatta. As he made his way he was drinking from one of the long-neck bottles. The other two were unopened and in a plastic bag. At the corner of Macquarie Street he went into a phone box to call his brother. The opened VB bottle was on a bench inside the phone booth. The offender, at the time a passenger in a red Ford Laser being driven by a juvenile and in which McLennan also was with two others and the offender, spotted Kiaron Mucullough. He said to the driver, “Stop the car, there’s a guy with a long-neck at the pay phone and I’m going to take it.” He also called on one of them to jump out ”just in case it turns back on me.” 18 Thomas alighted from the car and went across the road to the phone booth. McLennan also alighted from the car. He too walked across the road but hung back from the phone booth. There was some interchange between Mucullough and the offender. Mucullough stepped outside the phone booth and the offender pushed and shoved him. Mucullough ran across the street, fearful, turned into the Church Street Mall, ran in the direction of the railway station carrying his two VB bottles in the plastic bag. Matthew Thomas chased him, so too did Jake McLennan. McLennan was the one who tripped Mucullough and Mucullough fell to the ground, dropped the plastic bag containing the VB bottles. Regrettably they did not break. Had they broken it may well be that this robbery would not have occurred. 19 While he was on the ground both men, McLennan and the offender, started belting into Mucullough. Both, in my view, were kicking Mucullough on the ground. Mucullough managed to hold the offender’s leg. As best I can tell, the offender then started kicking with his other leg. Mucullough managed to hold onto both of this offender's legs. Whether the offender panicked or whether he decided to end the situation then and there, he picked up the plastic bag containing the bottles of VB, swung them over his shoulder and hit Mucullough in the back of the head with the bottles. He then picked up one of the VB bottles from the ground and he and McLennan retreated to the Ford Laser. 20 Two police officers on foot patrol were told by a member of the public of the bashing in the mall. They hurried and saw the offender and McLennan running along Church Street to the car. Once in the car the offender said, “Drive off; look what I’ve got” and pointed to his trophy, the VB bottle. He placed that in the boot of the car where it was later found by police. It was not long before the police were speaking to the offender at a nearby BP Service Station. He was asked to show his hands. On his hands were blood stains. He sought to explain those by saying he had hurt himself at work. I am satisfied there were no wounds on his hands that caused that blood. There was also blood on his shoes and shorts. Those items of clothing were seized. 21 The crucial facts of the Kiaron Mucullough robbery were much in dispute. I heard from the victim who was unable to identify his assailants and Jake McLennan. McLennan was a co-offender. The law recognises that co-offenders and accomplices are persons who belong to a class of witnesses who maybe unreliable, have an interest in minimising their own offending conduct and are striving, or often striving, to ingratiate themselves with prosecutors by giving an account that implicates the prosecuted. They are also recognised as witnesses who maybe inaccurate, dishonest but nonetheless impressive. Even so, McLennan’s general account I find convincing. 22 I have sought to recognise the possibility of and identify the fact of some minimising by him. The starting point for the accused and McLennan was the same, that is, that Thomas was the one who made his way to the telephone box. That being so it was Thomas who scared the victim whilst at the box and caused him to run. I have no doubt that that was done through threats, abuse and striking him. It is to be remembered that Thomas [as said, read McCullough] was drunk and probably would have lacked physical coordination. It is also, I suppose, to be remembered that the offender was drunk as well. As he was running, that is as Mucullough was running, he heard someone behind him. I am satisfied that someone was initially Thomas. I am also satisfied McLennan joined and probably overtook Thomas. McLennan’s evidence is that he was across the road. I am not entirely sure that that is so.23 Mucullough makes no mention of seeing a second person in his evidence. Mucullough’s evidence is that he thought that there was only one person involved in the attack upon him. He is wrong, indeed he told the police he thought that there were two because of the amount of force used. I think in saying that he accurately described his situation to the police; it is to be remember that that account was given much, much closer to the event than his evidence. 24 McLennan’s evidence appears to have some self-serving portions to it. However, his account of Thomas saying he saw a man with long-neck bottles whilst he, Thomas, was in the car, is consistent with Thomas making his way directly to where the bottles were and with Thomas ending up robbing the man of them. His account of there being blows struck at the telephone between Mucullough and Thomas is consistent with Thomas attempting to secure the bottles then. Mucullough’s account of being scared is consistent with him being assaulted and some attempt to take his property. The chase by Thomas in circumstances where his claimed purpose was to use the phone makes no sense. The chase however does make sense if one accepts Thomas had an intent to rob. 25 I accept that during the actual attack McLennan may have sought to reduce his role. But I also accept Mucullough’s account to the police that there was enough violence in the attack upon him for two persons to be involved.26 I cannot be satisfied that the victim was struck with anything prior to falling to the ground as he claimed. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender struck the victim a number of times by kicking actions at a time when the victim was on the ground. As I earlier said I am also satisfied McLennan did too.27 The injuries sustained by Mucullough were reported by Dr Renaldo Hufana. He saw Mr Mucullough at 2.15am on 3 March 2005. The doctor’s observations were that Mucullough was orientated to day, date and place, alert, coherent and not in distress. His airway was clear and breathing normal. His Glasgow Coma score was 15/15; the injuries sustained were four: a two and a half centimetre laceration to the occipital area with surrounding haematoma, a one centimetre superficial laceration to the parietal area, swelling over the nasal area with no active bleeding, erythema to the right supra-scapula area. An x-ray showed nasal bone fractures. The victim was advised not to blow his nose and to obtain a referral from his local doctor to an ear, nose and throat specialist once the nasal swelling had subsided. The other injuries were treated. He was discharged at 4.02 on the same day. Mucullough had arrived at hospital at 11pm, was not seen, as I say, by the doctor until 2.15 and was discharged a little less than two hours after being seen by Dr Hufana. 28 I am satisfied the offender was well affected by alcohol on each occasion - by each occasion I mean in the Kandiah and Mucullough robberies. Indeed I am satisfied his associates on each occasion were also to some greater or lesser degree likewise affected by alcohol. 29 The degree of planning for the Kandiah offence was greater. I am satisfied Thomas and his companions were at the golf course in the area of the walkway with a view to assessing their chances of robbing a pedestrian. I am satisfied when they began to ‘close-in’ from a hundred metres it was with the intent of the whole group to commit the robbery. The selection of a seat in advance of Kandiah was designed to facilitate the robbery. Thereafter, events would require appropriate responses from the robbers to achieve the robbery. I am satisfied the items targeted included a mobile phone and money. As best I can tell the motive for the robbery was to obtain money to continue a lifestyle in which alcohol was important focus. I do not regard the evidence as establishing that Thomas played any leadership role in that robbery.30 The Mucullough robbery was an opportunistic response to seeing a drunken man alone with alcohol. In this robbery Thomas did take a leadership role in that he initiated the approach and the necessary episode of violence to commit the robbery at the phone booth. The proceeds for this appalling level of violence amount to one bottle of beer. The motive for the robbery was simply to deny by force a working man his beer so that he, Thomas, could drink it himself. So stated, could evidence of such a worthless motive justify so worthless a priority?OBJECTIVE CRIMINALITY31 From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of each offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in that offence with criminalities of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the seriousness of the criminality of each of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality will have an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.32 Gleeson J, when Chief Justice of New South Wales encapsulated the essence of the legal wrong done by robbers and the reason why substantial punishment is required in R v Rause unreported, NSWCCA 8 August 1992 his Honour said, 
     
      
      ”One of the primary purposes of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace. In this connection the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and to go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence. It also embraces respect for the property of others. Offences of the kind committed by the present [offender] are not trivial instances of disrespect of private property, they are serious breaches of the peace. They are direct attacks upon the security of the person and the property which the law exists to protect.” 
      
    His Honour in that case continued by saying, 
     
      
      “It is quite likely this young man does not understand and he may never understand the seriousness of his antisocial behaviour. But the courts understand it. Crimes of this kind especially when committed by an offender with long criminal history deserves severe punishment.” 
      
    In this case, of course, the offender does not have (as I will come to later) a long criminal history. 33 The prominent feature of both robberies is the level of violence administered. In cases of robbery, and more so in cases of robbery with wounding, a substantial degree of violence is an element of the offence. Consequently the administration of violence does not constitute an independent aggravating feature. Having said that however one still needs to examine the essence of criminality exhibited by the element of this offence against other robberies in which violence is also an element. The level of violence in each of these robberies is vicious; is administered in each case when the victim was on the ground; is administered by kicking and kicking by more than a single person. There is a level of disinhibition in the violence administered. Having said that the level of violence is not at the extreme level, but it is above the level of violence seen in many robberies.34 The value of goods taken in either robbery is not great. Indeed I have remarked on the inexplicable situation where the level of violence administered to Mucullough yielded only a 750 mil bottle of beer worth, as I understand it, something less than ten dollars. 35 The robbery of Mucullough is aggravated by its being done in company with McLennan. The wounding of Mucullough is an element of the offence, thus the fact of the wounding does not present as some independent feature of aggravation, nor is the overall wounding as great as is seen in many robbery with wounding cases. However, in assessing the criminality exhibited in this element the targeting of the head where traumatic brain injury can readily be a consequence of kicking or striking, as in this case, increases the criminality by comparison with those cases where the wounding is also minor but relates to less vulnerable parts of the body. 36 From the photographs it appears that there were two areas of the skull that have been attacked. In addition to the wounding on the skull there are lacerations and bruising to the face. 37 The use of bottles as implements to strike Mucullough constitutes a matter aggravating the criminality used in the offence. It is clear the face was a target of the robbers. There are also lacerations and bruising to other parts of his body. However it should be noted no long term physical damage or scaring is reported as arising from the wounds. 38 Both victims were targeted when each was alone. Mucullough was also targeted when he was well affected by alcohol. Each victim then was targeted in situations when each was at his most vulnerable. Each was alone well away from homes and places, that is to say, isolated, as to places where he could flee to. Targeting persons in situations where they are at their most vulnerable does constitute a matter aggravating this offence.39 At the time he participated in the robbery of Mr Kandiah, Thomas had been charged with and was on bail for the robbery of Karion Mucullough. Again the commission of the second offence that is, the robbery of Mr Kandiah, when granted bail on the understanding that he would be of good behaviour, aggravates the criminality of the offender when committing the second offence.40 Mr Kandiah complained of racial slurs made to him during the robbery that, of course, was unfortunate. I cannot be satisfied that the offender was the person who made those slurs. Nor can I be satisfied there was any racial motivation in the selection of Mr Kandiah as the intended victim of the robbery. He was selected on the criteria that he was alone, well isolated from any potential rescue and was carrying a brief case and likely would have a mobile phone. 41 An overview of each offence reveals it to be not some minor example of this kind of robbery. The criminality of the conduct exhibited in each robbery is serious enough to call for a sentence of full-time incarceration of some significance.VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT42 I have received a victim impact statement from Vasanthan Kandiah. The material in that statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent that opinions are expressed in the statement I recognise they too have not been the subject of cross-examination. 43 A victim impact statement may, if I accept it as reliable, provide unsworn evidence as to the facts of the offence and their effect upon the victim. The function of statements such as the one read by Mr Kandiah in court and the one to which I am about to refer, give to the victims an opportunity of being heard in sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by the actions of an offender or in this case offenders. Secondly, it enables the sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender. Thirdly, the victim impact statement contributes to an offender at least hearing at first hand and hopefully gaining some insight into the impact his offending conduct had upon the victim. Finally, the victim impact statement ensures that a court has a continuing consciousness of the impact violent crime has upon those ordinary men and women who are its victims. As such victim impact statements play an important part in the administration of criminal justice. 44 I do not intend to review the statement read by Mr Kandiah. He had his opportunity to read it in court, but he had annexed to it a report by Alison Rowe, a clinical psychologist, with whom he had been consulting. She makes these points, 
     
      
      “Kandiah was clearly very anxious during his appointments, speaking rapidly most of the time. He is suffering a number of trauma related symptoms including painful memories, distressing dreams, feeling that he is reliving the event, avoidance, difficulty in enjoying his normal pursuits, feelings distant from people, feeling numb, sleep disturbance, feeling very angry, difficulty concentrating, hyper-vigilance, physical distress such as a racing heart, feeling of choking, difficulty breathing and indigestion. 
      
     
     
      
      He is suffering a severely depressed level of mood and severe anxiety. He feels ashamed that he was unable to protect himself during the assault. His main way of coping has to be to mobilise his anger in his determination to have the perpetrators brought to justice. 
      
     
     
      
      Although Mr Kandiah has friends, because of his shame, he does not speak to anyone about this ordeal including his wife. Subsequently he has become socially withdrawn. Kandiah reported that he found the legal system very demoralising and frustrating and he feels that the law protects the criminals rather than the victims.  
      
     
     
      
      As a result of the assault he suffered injury to the tendons and ligaments of his left knee and right shoulder. He has ongoing problems with mobility and chronic pain with them; he is having physiotherapy and has noticed come improvement.” 
      
    45 It is not surprising that Mr Kandiah found the legal system demoralising and frustrating. Many of the victims do. Their aims and the aims of the criminal justice system are often very different. They would be seeking retribution. The criminal justice system seeks justice and in so doing, of course, seeks to ensure that only guilty persons are found guilty. That is, we recognise the presumption of innocence. That Mr Kandiah feels the law protects criminals rather than victims is certainly a view open to him but I am sure that accused persons often feel the other way. It is simply a matter of whose eyes one is looking at it through. Justice can only be successful if it is even-handed.SUBJECTIVE MATTERS46 I turn now to the subjective factors; I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for these criminal offences but I am also sentencing this offender for them. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand, or who have stood, for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of these offences by this offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.FAMILY DYNAMICS AND PERSONAL BACKGROUND47 Matthew Thomas was born in August of 1984. At the time of each robbery he was still 20 years old, heading for his 21st birthday. He lives with his family in the Parramatta region. He has three siblings; two sisters and a brother, all older than he. His family, parents and one sister, as best I can tell, in particular, have supported him on each occasion he has been to court. At least three of his family have accompanied him on all occasions.48 He discloses a happy childhood. He has a partner of about the same age, employed in the loans department at a finance company. She has no problematic substance abuse and no psychiatric or criminal history. Matthew Thomas regards her influence on his behaviour as positive. There are no children.49 It would seem in his mid teenage years he gathered around him a negative group. The lifestyle choices of that group were alcohol, risk taking and antisocial behaviour.50 On each of the two occasions he offended, alcohol and some of his unfocussed and inebriated peers were part of the scene.EDUCATION, TRAINING AND SKILLS51 At school he apparently obtained average grades. He was suspended in Year 7 for truancy. He left schooling, having completed Year 10.52 Thereafter, he worked as a car detailer for four years. For a year he then worked in a delivery position for a window company. That, he found arduous and returned to car detailing. More recently, he has worked as a landscape gardener.53 He has supplied a reference from his current boss, John Brogden, with whom he has been for four months; it might now be more. Mr Brogden indicates a willingness to employ Matthew Thomas as “the opportunity arises”. He reports Thomas works well; does not require constant supervision; is polite, courteous and his honest.GENERAL HEALTH54 From appearances in court, it would seem Matthew Thomas is a fit, medium sized, stocky built, 22 year old male. He is reported to have no prominent scarring or tattoos. So far as one can tell, he appears to be in good physical health. He is 172 centimetres high.MENTAL HEALTH55 He falls within the average intelligence range. When tested by Peter Ashkar, a forensic psychologist retained by the defence, there was no evidence of impaired executive functioning. Ashkar is satisfied Matthew Thomas’s intellectual functioning is intact.ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE56 Alcohol abuse was a factor in each of the offences before me.57 Ashkar opined, the offender required psychological treatment for the management of his alcohol use.58 The offender gave evidence, that I accept, of multi-weekly visits to Alcoholics Anonymous. Two fellow AA members have supplied letters attesting to his attendance.59 Dr Stella Dalton reports that the offender came under her care in March 2006. The offender, she says, recognises he has a drinking problem. In October of last year, she expressed herself happy to continue his treatment. She noted that if a custodial sentence was imposed she requested a treatment order to the Wayback program.60 The Court is both satisfied and impressed with the determined and dedicated effort the offender has made to address his alcohol abuse. He has not drunk in a public place since the second offence.ATTITUDE TO THE OFFENCES61 He has expressed remorse for the Mucullough robbery. He pleaded guilty to the offence, a plea based upon accepting responsibility for his offending conduct. He has publicly expressed contrition for the offence to Peter Ashkar.62 It is likely he also privately regrets his involvement in the Kandiah robbery. Publicly he has not done so. Identification was the real issue in the trial. He sought to avoid legal responsibility and accountability for it by challenging the identification evidence. One can understand that because the consequence of a conviction must be imprisonment.63 Even though he has sought to avoid legal responsibility, that does not mean he lacks insight into the offence or its causes, nor does it mean that he does not regret the injuries occasioned to Kandiah.64 He appears, post this particular robbery, to have addressed his alcohol issues and the equally difficult task of disentangling himself from his antisocial peers. I am less confident of his success in doing the latter, but I am satisfied he is seeking to address that issue.CHARACTER AND ANTECEDENTS65 Matthew Thomas is now 22 years old. He completed to Year 10 at high school. Thereafter, he appears to have maintained employment in the years since leaving school. His latest boss speaks well of him as an employee. He has good family support and, as best I can tell, he reciprocates by supporting them.66 True, he did associate with a group of negative peers since his mid teenage years. In those circumstances, the only entry on his antecedents, prior to these offences, relates to a trespass type offence on rail property for which he received a s.10 discharge.67 Effectively, at the time of the Mucullough robbery, the offender had no prior convictions on his record. His record does not disentitle him to some leniency, particularly in respect of the first robbery on Mucullough.PLEA TO THE FIRST OFFENCE68 Thomas pleaded guilty to the Mucullough robbery on the date scheduled for the trial. In so doing, he was entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. That utilitarian value, in this case, is somewhat diminished by virtue of the fact that the facts upon which the plea was based were in dispute. A hearing was required in this Court. When assessing the appropriate discount it is appropriate to tabulate, therefore, what is embraced by the utilitarian value of the plea.69 The guilty plea must be recognised as a significant contribution by advancing the administration of criminal justice; first and foremost because the interests of the administration of criminal justice is served by the public acknowledgement by an offender of his guilt. Pleas of guilt by offenders sustain, thereby, the community’s confidence in the administration of criminal justice by maintaining confidence of the community in the investigation of crime and the community’s expectation that those guilty of crime will be held accountable for it.70 The administration of justice is also served because court time, witnesses’ time, legal expenses and the like are freed so that they can be devoted to other cases. The plea reduces considerably the likelihood of contest in an appeal on the issue of guilt in respect of, in this case, the Mucullough robbery. All of these are important utilitarian factors insofar as the administration of criminal justice, in the Mucullough case, are concerned.71 In this case, the plea still serves the interest of criminal justice so that the confidence of criminal justice is retained; the time taken to contest the issues was not as long as the estimated hearing length of the trial; no jury was required; the cross-examination of each Prosecution witness was completed within a session. Although I accept it may be towards the top of the available range in circumstances such as this, I intend to give a 15 percent discount for the plea.REHABILITATION PROSPECTS72 I am satisfied the offender’s rehabilitation prospects are solid. He has a supportive family. He has insight into his offending behaviour and its causes. He has taken meaningful steps towards addressing factors causing these two offences. He has a good employment record and the support of his current employer. He enjoys good health, free from mental health issues that could impede his rehabilitation progress.73 The only real negative issue I see is the counter-rehabilitation pressures that he will fact from the prison population. Current recidivist figures suggest nearly two out of three prisoners return to prison within two years of their release from incarceration. Even so, these offences call for incarceration because of the need for punishment, retribution and deterrence.SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES74 This is case where special circumstances should be found. Among the reasons I find special circumstances is the principle identified by Hunt J in a case, which I think is Pham but it may not be, but, if need be, I will find the reference. When dealing with young offenders who had committed serious offences, his Honour said, in part: 
     
      
      “[W] Where a youth conducts himself in the way an adult might conduct himself and commits a crime of considerable gravity, the functions of the court to protect the community require deterrence and retribution to remain significant elements in sentencing him...that is not to say, however, that his youth is to be disregarded in the sentencing process, far from it.  
      It is of particular relevance in determining the appropriate relationship between the minimum and additional terms and it remains an element (albeit less significant than usual) to be considered in assessing the length of the sentence to be imposed. General deterrence, however, remains a primary importance in the circumstances of the case (My emphasis). 
      ” 
      
    75 While his Honour was speaking, in the circumstances of that case, in respect of a juvenile offender, the principle still has some resonance when sentencing others who are young.76 Other factors of importance in the decision to find special circumstances is a recognition that this is Matthew Thomas’ first time in custody; that his rehabilitation is to be better advanced in the community based setting; that he has already done much to advance his rehabilitation.SETTING THE SENTENCE77 As I said, this is a case which calls for deterrence. In modern Australian society there is a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by both the Federal and the State parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by parliaments is to deter those tempted to breach its provisions (see Walden v Hensler (1987) 163 CLR 561 per Brennan J at 569-570. Parliament does that by prescribing maximum penalties for offences for those who engage in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. Consequently, when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, that person is exposed to the possible maximum penalty for the statute breached.78 In this case, the maximum penalty for the robbery of Mr Mucullough is 25 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the robbery of Mr Kandiah is 20 years imprisonment.79 Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires the sentencing Judge to keep in mind the general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large by keeping in mind those maximum penalties when determining the appropriate penalty in this case and also keeping in mind the deterrent purpose of those maximum penalties.80 There is a specific deterrence aimed at individuals like-minded to the offender, such as those in the motor vehicle with him; such as those, yet to be found, who committed the offence against Mr Kandiah, who would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which this offender is being sentenced.81 Finally, there is a component of deterrence to be considered, personal to the offender, with a view to deterring him or her from reoffending.82 Given the structure of the sentence that I have determined; the fact that this offender has been to trial; has been before the Court in respect of both matters; has been before the Local Court in respect of both matters; has been arrested and interrogated in respect of one of them, if not both, I am of a view that no further personal deterrence is required.BALANCING THE OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE FACTS83 Both offences before me are serious. Notionally and factually, the more serious offence was the robbery with wounding of Kiaran Mucullough. The beating of him was far more vicious than the attack upon Mr Kandiah. The beating occurred at a time when the offender was already in possession of the goods he was intending to steal. His role in this robbery was as leader and instigator.84 The Kandiah robbery was done with two more co-offenders. I have not ascribed a leadership role to the offender, nor can I find that he was responsible for any of the physical violence to Mr Kandiah once he was on the ground.TOTALITY85 I am sentencing for two offences. The overall sentence imposed must reflect the totality of criminality found in both criminal events. I do not propose to set completely concurrent sentences. The sentences will be partially cumulative to achieve the required totality. I have determined that the accumulation will amount to six months.IMPACT OF GUIDELINE JUDGMENTS86 Two guideline judgments have impacted upon the outcome of these sentences. I have already made allowance for the plea of guilty as I understand I am permitted to do in accordance with the principles in Thomson & Houlton.87 The guideline judgment of R. v Henry also has application in each of these two robbery cases. I am aware of the principles enunciated in that case. The common criteria relied upon when setting the guideline are in the terms of the guideline. I acknowledge its importance as a guideline in the sentence I am imposing. But for the plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence of four years for the robbery of Mucullough, applying a 15 per cent discount and rounding it out that becomes a sentence of three years and five months. I will set a non parole period of eighteen months and a balance of term of twenty three months to commence from today.88 In respect of the robbery of Mr Kandiah I will set an overall sentence of three and a half years. I will set a non parole period of eighteen months to commence on 30 September 2007.88 The effect is to impose an overall sentence, if my maths is correct, of three years and eleven months [as said – read four years]and an overall non parole period of two years. That certainly is my intention.89 Would you stand up please.90 Matthew Thomas, I convict you of robbing Kiaran Mucullough of a quantity of alcohol on 2 March 2005 and that you in committing that robbery used corporal violence upon him and wounded him.91 I set a non parole period of eighteen months to commence on 30 March, that is today’s date, 2007 and to expire on my calculation on 29 September 2008. 92 I set a balance of term of twenty-three months to expire on 29 August 2010.93 Mr Thomas I also convict you of an offence at a time when you were in company with unknown persons robbing Vasanthan Kandiah of his mobile phone and a briefcase and its contents which were his property. For that offence I set a non parole period of eighteen months to commence on 30 September 2007 and to expire on 29 March 2009. 94 I set a balance of term of two years to expire on 29 March 2011.95 It is not for me to release you to parole. I can only do that in cases where the sentence is three years or less. Your main sentence is one of three years and five months.96 The Parole Board will be the people who will release you. They will take into account the progress that you make during your time in custody. If you make good progress or continue the progress you are currently making you are likely to be released on your earliest release date which is 29 March 2009.97 I recommend to the Parole Board that they consider making an order sought by Dr Dalton of a Wayback Treatment Program. HIS HONOUR: Is there any other order?WONG: Your Honour in relation to the robbery in company matter your Honour there is a s 166 Certificate which contains the back-up charge of goods in custody. The crown would be asking for that matter to be dismissed your Honour.HIS HONOUR: To be dismissed?WONG: Yes, your Honour the back-up charge.HIS HONOUR: Pursuant to s 166 and on the application of the Crown I dismiss the back-up charge.STEEL: Your Honour the effective end of the whole sentences is 29 March 2011?HIS HONOUR: Yes.STEEL: Which is a four year overall term?HIS HONOUR: I made it three years - I see it is a four year overall term, yes.STEEL: It is just that your Honour had indicated--HIS HONOUR: Three years and eleven months, I was distracted by the five months but because I have accumulated it by six, it becomes four years, thank you.Officers, Is it possible me to make a recommendation that Mr Thomas be classified to minimum security as soon as possible? There is some process by which I can get him classified quickly and I am just not sure how I go about it.CORRECTIONAL OFFICER: I not sure your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Well I recommend that he be classified as soon as possible with a view to him being placed in, if it is deemed appropriate, minimum security as soon as possible.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon her by McGuire DCJ in the District Court on 31 March 2006 following her plea of guilty to a single count of malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    2 By s33 of the Crimes Act 1900 such an offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. Pursuant to Part 4, Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the “Sentencing Procedure Act”) a standard non-parole period of seven years is applicable. McGuire DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for five years and four months with a non-parole period of two years and ten months, commencing on 1 December 2004. The balance of term was two years and six months. In so sentencing the applicant, his Honour found that special circumstances within the meaning of s44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act existed, justifying departure from the statutory proportions between the head sentence and the non-parole period there specified. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    3 The offence was committed at about 11.45 am on 1 December 2004, a Wednesday. The applicant lived in a flat above a mixed business convenience store in Kings Cross. She was acquainted with the proprietor of the store, Mrs Kang, who had, on occasions, shown her kindness. When the applicant walked into the store on this occasion Mrs Kang thought she looked unwell and perhaps hungry and offered her some milk. The applicant preferred an ice cream, which Mrs Kang gave her. The applicant then walked behind the counter, produced a small knife and pointed the blade towards Mrs Kang. The applicant spoke to Mrs Kang but Mrs Kang had limited English and did not understand. A struggle ensued. Mrs Kang attempted to drag the applicant out of the shop and into the street in an attempt to attract the attention of police. This went on for some time. The applicant stabbed Mrs Kang to the front left-hand side of the neck and again to the left rear of the neck. Both wounds bled profusely. Mrs Kang attempted to disarm the applicant, who herself was cut around the hand and arm. Mrs Kang thought the applicant was going to kill her. 
     
      
    4 Police arrived and separated the two women. They asked the applicant whether the knife was hers. She replied that it was, but falsely reported that Mrs Kang had grabbed the knife from her and that this was what caused the struggle. She was found to be in possession of a second knife, secreted in the left leg of her pants. Mrs Kang was taken to St Vincent’s Hospital and treated for her wounds. She underwent surgery. She remained in hospital for four days.

    5 The applicant’s background and history are quite remarkable, and, in many respects, tragic. She was born in Korea on 14 September 1983 and was, accordingly, 21 years of age at the time of the offence. She had only one prior criminal offence, possession of a prohibited drug for which she was, on 25 August 2004, dealt with by way of a bond. Given the circumstances I am about to recount, that she had reached that age without any other conviction is, to say the least, surprising. At the age of nine months the applicant was adopted by an Australian couple. She had an older sister, also Korean-born and also adopted. 
     
      
    6 Initially, the adoption was successful and, although the applicant described her adoptive father as a “closed man” and “emotionally distant”, she described her adoptive mother as “soft, caring and forgiving”. She had a close relationship with both her mother and her maternal grandmother. There was an element of resentment in her relationship with her sister; this may be because the sister was a gifted ballet dancer, for which she was the subject of much attention. 
     
      
    7 When the applicant was about 14 her maternal grandmother, to whom she was very close, died, and her death had a significant effect upon the applicant. She saw a psychologist for some time but did not feel that she received real assistance and discontinued. 
     
      
    8 In any event, she left school shortly thereafter, and fell under the influence of a series of older men, each of whom was abusive in one way or another, who exploited her, and each of whom was involved with illicit drugs. She herself began using drugs, and became involved, at the behest of one or more of her male companions, in prostitution. The history shows that the applicant’s life swung dramatically towards a drug, prostitution, and crime culture from her mid teens. 
     
      
    9 The sentencing judge had the benefit of a psychiatric report prepared by Professor Greenberg, and a psychological report prepared by Ms Robilliard. These detailed the applicant’s history. 
     
      
    10 She has been diagnosed as suffering from a personality disorder with borderline features, depression and auditory hallucinations. She herself reported that she had made three suicide attempts, at the ages of 15, 17 and 18. She binges alcohol. Professor Greenberg considered that the auditory hallucinations were probably attributable to a drug-induced hallucinosis. 
     
      
    11 Testing by Ms Robilliard indicated that the applicant is in a high risk of re-offending. She found that the applicant scored extremely low on a scale measuring defensiveness, indicating emotional pain, possibly related to low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, loss of energy and suicidal ideation. She concluded her report by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Recommendations are very difficult in this case as this young woman is tragically chaotic in her lifestyle and habits, both of which are potentially self-destructive.” 
        
       
      
    12 The applicant has had the benefit of unceasing support form her parents, particularly her mother. Her parents have, apparently at considerable cost, repeatedly arranged for the applicant to be provided with private rehabilitation facilities. She has never responded. They have persevered against all the odds. 
     
      
    13 Both the applicant and her mother gave evidence on the sentencing proceedings. It is convenient to begin with the evidence given by her mother. It may be observed that the applicant is extremely fortunate still to retain the strong support of her family, particularly her mother, who has attempted to explore the circumstances that have led the applicant to her present predicament. She gave evidence that she herself had visited Mrs Kang. When she told the applicant that she proposed to do this the applicant spontaneously asked her to apologise on her behalf. She also said that the applicant had sent letters of apology to her parents for her conduct. 
     
      
    14 Mrs Matzick has been visiting the applicant on a weekly basis and gave evidence of her current behaviour. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… She’s been incarcerated now, that’s tomorrow, for sixteen months. She is waiting to hear of … a date of release and then I think she will be able to think about some things. To think about where she is going. She is also then able to do some courses which she hasn’t been able to do, because that’s not offered to people who aren’t sentenced. So she said to me only last week, mum I just want to do some courses. I’ll do every drug and alcohol course that comes up. I’ll do it all, but until I’m sentenced I am unable to do any of it. But I think she just takes one step at a time at the moment, because she can’t focus any further.” 
        
       
      
    15 The applicant’s evidence was also telling. She confirmed much of the history which has already been set out, and which need not be repeated. McGuire DCJ was plainly intrigued by the applicant’s history, and most concerned about her potential to commit herself to what will (if she undertakes it) inevitably be a long and difficult process of rehabilitation. At about this point in her evidence in chief the applicant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Listen, I don’t want to talk any more, I’m finished.” 
        
       
      
    16 When asked to persevere she declined. 
     
      
    17 However, when his Honour asked questions about rehabilitation, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t think about that. I know I’m going to be doing the next few years in gaol, so I don’t even think about where I’m going to be at in the next few years. That’s something I’m not – I told [my solicitor] this morning I’m not going to say oh well after I’ve finished my sentence, yeah, I’ll go to rehab for another twelve months. That’s something I’ll decide after I’ve done my time.” 
        
       
      
     His Honour invited her to consider that the sentence he would impose might depend upon her commitment to rehabilitation. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do realise that. [My solicitor] went through it this morning with me but I am not going to sit here and lie and say, yeah, I’ll do rehab when I don’t want to.” 
        
       
      
     His Honour observed that it was rare, in sentencing proceedings, to experience such frankness. It played a part in his reasoning on sentence, not entirely to the applicant’s benefit, but also not entirely to her detriment. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence  
       
      
    18 His Honour set out the facts of the offence, which he described as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a vicious attack upon a shopkeeper, a lady who had treated the prisoner as a friend, who had offered her nothing but kindness … an entirely unprovoked and uncalled for and unjustified gratuitous violence visited upon the victim.” 
        
       
       
      He correctly described it as “grossly criminal behaviour”. 
       
      
    19 He then noted that he found “this a most difficult sentencing exercise”, the one reason given being that the applicant was grossly affected by drugs at the time of the offence (something he recognised did not excuse her behaviour). 
     
      
    20 He found it difficult to be optimistic about her prospects of rehabilitation, noting that she appeared to be “ambivalent” about engaging in meaningful rehabilitation or counselling. He accepted that the applicant’s representations to her mother about her intentions for the future were genuine (although he did this with some misgivings). He allowed the maximum discount (25%) in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, in respect of her plea of guilty, which was entered, he said, at the earliest opportunity. He noted that the applicant had remained drug free in prison and saw this as providing some degree of hope. 
     
      
    21 He accordingly found special circumstances and proceeded to impose the sentence I have mentioned above. 
     
      
    22 The applicant was represented in the sentencing proceedings, but is unrepresented in this application. She has formulated her own grounds of appeal, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour erred when he took into account it was entirely unprovoked, uncalled for and unjustified attack. 
         
        2. His Honour erred when he failed to consider the violence and sexual abuse I was subjected to in my early teens. 
         
        3. His Honour erred when he stated I suffer from no obvious mental illness. 
         
        4. My solicitor had not followed my instructions on the day of sentencing and I had not received my full brief prior to sentencing.” 
        
       
       
      The grounds of the application 
       
       
      Ground 1: “His Honour erred when he took into account it was entirely unprovoked, uncalled for and unjustified attack” 
       
      
    23 It was not clear from the applicant’s submissions whether her complaint is of the characterisation of the offence as an “unprovoked, uncalled for and unjustified attack” or of his Honour having taken that into account. Either way, the ground cannot succeed. In so describing the attack his Honour was entirely correct. It was, of course, also entirely appropriate that he take this into account. There is no substance in this ground of the application. 
     
      
       
       
      Ground 2: “His Honour erred when he failed to consider the violence and sexual abuse I was subjected to in my early teens” 
       
      
    24 This ground also cannot be sustained. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… She left school at an early age and almost immediately began using drugs and alcohol and mixing with highly undesirable young people, including those who were obviously of criminal intent and background. 
        
       
       
        
        She headed into a series of disastrous relationships. The youths or men she chose to cohabit with used her as a source of income to fund their drug habits when they required her to engage upon a career of prostitution. She, of course, used the income to fund her own habit and despite the abuse heaped upon her in those relationships she seemed content to remain in them.” 
        
       
      
    25 This ground ought to be rejected. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Ground 3: “His Honour erred when he stated I  
      suffer 
       from no obvious mental illness” 
       
      
    26 To some extent this misrepresents what his Honour said. The passage in the Remarks on Sentence is: 
     
      
       
        
        “She is an attractive young lady, suffering from no obvious mental or physical disability, albeit at this stage she has Hepatitis C.” 
        
       
      
    27 Whether this was correct or not requires some analysis of the reports of Ms Robilliard, and, more particularly, Professor Greenberg. 
     
      
    28 Professor Greenberg reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “I note from her medical record at Justice Health that she was seen by Dr McClure who diagnosed her with a personality disorder with borderline features, depression and auditory hallucinations … Dr Martin (a psychiatrist) noted she had instability of mood and that she was complaining of ‘voices’. Dr Martin was of the opinion that she had a borderline personality disorder and the voices were in keeping with this diagnosis and that she was not psychotic.” 
        
       
      
    29 The reference to Justice Health makes it plain that Dr McClure’s diagnosis occurred after the applicant’s arrest, since she had not previously been involved with the prison system. That means that the diagnosis was of relevantly recent origin, no later than 1 December 2004. In a later part of his report Professor Greenberg set out his own diagnoses which were: 
     
      
    · poly-substance dependence· drug induced hallucinosis, in partial remission· personality disorder· physical – Hepatitis C. 
     
      
    30 There is no explicit reference in the Remarks on Sentence to either the report of Professor Greenberg or of Ms Robilliard. However, some of the factual matters contained in the Remarks are clearly drawn from one or other or both of those reports. 
     
      
    31 The passage in the Remarks on Sentence is not easily reconciled with the extracts from Professor Greenberg’s report. However, Professor Greenberg’s assessment of the applicant’s mental condition was not such as to attract the principles stated in cases such as R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Even if the observation in the Remarks did not do complete justice to the opinion of Professor Greenberg, it can have had no impact on the ultimate outcome of the sentencing process. The diagnoses did not in any way entitle the applicant to any reduction in the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed. They were merely a part of the detail of the history and circumstances relevant to the overall approach to sentencing. 
     
      
    32 I would, accordingly, reject this ground of the application. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: “My solicitor had not followed instructions on the day of sentencing and I had not received by full brief prior to sentencing” 
       
      
    33 I take this ground to be a complaint about the manner in which her legal representative conducted the sentencing hearing. Generally speaking, an offender is bound by the manner in which the legal representatives conduct the case. A ground of appeal complaining of the manner in which criminal proceedings are conducted will only succeed where a recognisable miscarriage of justice can be demonstrated, resulting possibly from “flagrant incompetence” or some other cause: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. 
     
      
    34 The applicant put before this Court a series of documents. One of these was an affidavit sworn 12 March 2007 by herself. This was received by this Court on the usual basis; that is, that it would be taken into account if but only if the court found error in the sentencing process and proposed to move to re-sentence. 
     
      
    35 Of more concern were two other documents which the applicant said were letters written by herself and her mother to be provided to the sentencing judge, but which were not. The appellant’s letter is a letter in which she expresses “guilt and remorse” and accepts, despite her intoxication, full responsibility for what had occurred. She also wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Every day I am punished with my own thoughts of how many people I have affected by my own recklessness. 
        
       
       
        
        I am changing my behavior (sic) and wish not to return to the lifestyle I had previously. I have now been drug free for sixteen months and realise how drugs have affected my life as well as others in the past.” 
        
       
      
    36 Her mother’s letter is a moving one, fleshing out, in considerable detail, the evidence that she gave. She recorded that the applicant had been a happy child, in a happy family. She described the applicant as “the most delightful child a parent could ever wish for”. 
     
      
    37 She recorded a change in mood and behaviour at the age of 12 and the onset of puberty. She gave considerable detail of the applicant’s associations with older and undesirable men. She recorded the applicant’s engagement in prostitution and drug use. 
     
      
    38 It may be that these documents could or even should have been put before the sentencing judge. Although they may not have been admissible in the proceedings to which the Evidence Act 1995 applied, no direction under s4(2) of that Act had been given to make the Act applicable, and in the ordinary course, the documents could have been tendered. However, it is to be remembered that both the applicant and her mother gave oral evidence, and, no doubt, the applicant’s solicitor took the view that their evidence substituted for the contents of these documents. Indeed, the applicant’s evidence went well beyond what was contained in the letter, and the letter could have added nothing to that evidence. Her mother’s evidence was less detailed and less forceful than that contained in her document, but nevertheless, covered the same essential points. 
     
      
    39 In my opinion no injustice has been shown by these documents not having been put before the sentencing judge. Their substance was. The decision to call oral evidence in preference to evidence in documentary form was well within counsel’s professional discretion. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion none of the grounds of the application can succeed. It remains to consider whether any less severe sentence ought to have been imposed. In my opinion there is no basis for coming to such a conclusion. 
     
      
    41 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 15 May 2006, following his pleas of guilty to two counts on an indictment. These were one count of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence (the indictable offence being assault); and one count of using an offensive weapon to avoid apprehension. In addition, pursuant to Part 3, Division 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”), the applicant asked that six matters on a Form 1 be taken into account. These included another offence of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence (again, the indictable offence was assault); steal motor vehicle; drive in a manner dangerous; resist police officer in the execution of duty; possess implements capable of being used to enter or drive or enter and drive a conveyance; drive whilst disqualified. 
     
      
    2 In respect of the each of the counts on the indictment, Andrew ADCJ imposed a total term of imprisonment of five years with a non-parole period of three years, each sentence commencing on 30 April 2005. He took into account the Form 1 offences on the first count. 
     
      
    3 Pursuant to s34 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, in respect of the offence on the Form 1 of driving whilst disqualified his Honour imposed a period of disqualification for two years to commence at the completion of a period of disqualification then current; in relation to the offence of drive in a manner dangerous, he imposed a period of three years’ disqualification to commence from the date of sentence, 16 May 2006. Although his Honour was under the impression that the applicant’s then current period of disqualification would end in 2016, the fact is (as the applicant agreed) he has been serially disqualified from holding a driver’s licence; on 22 October 2003, he was declared a habitual offender and disqualified from driving for five years from 22 February 2011 (i.e. to 22 February 2016); but on 22 October 2004, in the Local Court at Parramatta, in respect of an offence of driving furiously or recklessly or in a manner dangerous or at a speed dangerous, he was disqualified for a further three years from 22 February 2016 (i.e. to 22 February 2019); and, also on 22 October 2004, in respect of another offence of driving whilst disqualified, he was further disqualified for two years from 22 February 2019 (i.e. to 22 February 2021); and, also on 20 October 2004, in respect of yet another offence of driving whilst disqualified, apparently committed on a different date, the applicant was yet further disqualified from driving for another two years from 22 February 2021. Accordingly, even without the disqualification imposed by Andrew ADCJ, the applicant is disqualified from driving until 22 February 2023. It is remarkable that, in respect of each of the offences dealt with in October 2004, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment that was, in each case, suspended. 
     
      
    4 His Honour clearly intended to add a further period of disqualification to the existing series; equally clearly, he was in error in mistaking the end date of that series as 2016. But, since the Crown has neither appealed against that order, nor taken any point about it, in my view it is not now open to this Court to correct the error. The applicant has received something of a windfall in that, on current orders, he will be eligible to obtain a driver’s licence two years earlier than his Honour intended. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    5 The facts were put before his Honour by way of an agreed statement. The vehicle stolen by the applicant (the subject of the first offence on the Form 1) was a Toyota Dyna pantechnicon truck which had been parked in a secured area of a warehouse in Chester Hill. The entrance gate and switch motor were both damaged and the truck stolen. This occurred between the evening of 30 January 2005 and the early morning of 31 January 2005. 
     
      
    6 Late in the evening of 1 February 2005 the applicant was driving the truck along Wangi Road, Wangi Wangi (or in that vicinity). A Mr Joel Davis, with his companion, was driving in a utility truck on the same road. Mr Davis slowed down as he approached a blind corner; the applicant attempted to overtake him on the wrong side of unbroken lines. He did not complete that manoeuvre, but slowed and pulled in behind Mr Davis. He switched on the high beam of the headlights and closed to a very short distance behind the utility. Mr Davis continued, and signalling his intention, moved to the left of the road and slowed in order to allow the truck to overtake. The applicant drove the truck alongside the utility and then swerved in and out of the left lane. He then accelerated, braked harshly, and swung the truck into a ninety-degree turn so that it stopped in a position that blocked both lanes. Mr Davis was forced to brake harshly to avoid a collision. 
     
      
    7 This conduct constituted the offence of driving in a manner dangerous, the second offence on the Form 1. 
     
      
    8 The applicant opened the door and alighted from the truck. He was armed with an implement, described as a wooden bat or piece of log about one metre long and ten centimetres in diameter. He walked towards the utility vehicle occupied by Mr Davis and his friend. Mr Davis reversed the vehicle and telephoned police. The applicant re-entered the truck and drove up Wangi Road. 
     
      
    9 The use by the applicant of the wooden bat or piece of log constituted the third offence on the Form 1, of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence (assault). 
     
      
    10 At about half an hour after midnight Mr Davis had left his friend at her home and had begun to drive home. The weather was poor, with heavy rain, thunder and lightning. Mr Davis was about to make a right hand turn onto Wangi Road when he noticed the same truck parked in a ditch on the opposite side of the road. As he made the right hand turn the applicant turned on the lights of the truck and drove it directly at the driver’s door of the utility. Mr Davis had to swerve to avoid a collision. The front and back tyres of the utility went onto the dirt shoulder of the road and the vehicle slid sideways for a short distance. The truck narrowly missed the rear of the utility. Mr Davis drove off, again telephoning police. 
     
      
    11 This conduct on the part of the applicant constituted the offence the subject of the first count on the indictment, of using an offensive weapon with an intent to commit an indictable offence (assault). 
     
      
    12 Two police officers who were on duty at Morisset Police Station were assigned the call from Mr Davis. They drove to Wangi Road. They saw the truck being driven by the applicant in the opposite direction. They turned and followed, activating police lights and siren. The applicant caused the truck to brake and pulled it over to the side of the road, stopping on the verge. The police stopped a few metres behind the truck. The applicant then caused the truck to reverse, at some speed, straight into the front of the police vehicle. He then drove forwards and back onto the road towards Morisset. Some damage was caused to the front of the police vehicle. It was still drivable and the officers followed the truck, but maintaining a greater distance. 
     
      
    13 The applicant continued driving into Morisset, at about 80 kilometres per hour, through both 80 kilometre and 60 kilometre zones, and notwithstanding heavy rain that was still falling. The applicant turned off the truck’s lights, decelerated, and pulled over to the left side of the road. The applicant alighted from the truck and ran away. Police searched the truck. They found a piece of wood on the front seat and a bag of crystal substance on the floor. There were other items in the truck as well. This conduct constituted the offence the subject of the second count on the indictment, using an offensive weapon with intent to avoid apprehension. 
     
      
    14 Initially, efforts to locate the applicant were unsuccessful and the police officers returned to the police station. They received information that the applicant had been seen near the Morisset pharmacy, attended and, shortly after, located him hiding inside a garage of domestic premises. He was arrested. He struggled, was subdued, forced to the ground and handcuffed. The struggle constituted the fourth offence on the Form 1, of resisting police officer. 
     
      
    15 He was searched, and a key ring containing seven keys to various Toyota and Holden motor vehicles were found in his possession. This possession constituted the fifth offence on the Form 1, of possession of implements capable of being used for taking or driving a conveyance. The applicant was taken to Toronto Police Station where he was aggressive. He punched and kicked the walls, and refused to answer questions from the custody manager. He declined to be interviewed and declined to take part in an identification parade. He refused to consent to a DNA sample, but forensic procedures were, in any event, carried out. 
     
      
    16 As the applicant had been declared a habitual traffic offender and disqualified from driving for a period of five years from 22 February 2004, his driving constitutes the sixth offence on the Form 1, of driving whilst disqualified. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    17 The applicant was born on 31 August 1967 and was 37 years of age at the time of these offences. He has a lengthy criminal history which includes driving offences, dishonesty offences, offences of violence, including domestic violence, resisting police and one of supplying a prohibited drug. He is of Aboriginal descent. He has been diagnosed as suffering with Paranoid Schizophrenia. He has made more than one attempt on his own life. He has a long history of drug abuse, commencing with heroin at 15 years of age. He has also used amphetamines, cannabis and cocaine and has been alcohol dependent. He was assessed as having borderline intellect. A psychiatrist who reported on two occasions for the benefit of the sentencing judge diagnosed amphetamine dependence which, he thought, precipitated psychotic episodes. He has suffered a head injury of some kind in the past, which will limit his ability to problem solve and benefit from drug counselling, and possibly be a barrier to psychiatric rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      The remarks on sentence  
       
      
    18 The sentencing judge set out the facts from the statement of facts that had been put before him. He (correctly) described them as “alarming”. He accepted that the applicant was acting “in some kind of drug-induced psychotic road rage”. 
     
      
    19 He noted the past criminal history. He accepted that the applicant was suffering from mental illness at the time of the offences and correctly directed himself as to the manner in which mental illness may be relevant to sentencing: see R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346; R v Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Pearce, unreported, NSWCCA, 1 November 1996; R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. He noted that in relation to the second offence on the indictment, an aggravating factor was that the victims included police officers. 
     
      
    20 He then proceeded to impose the sentences I have set out above. 
     
      
       
       
      The application for leave to appeal 
       
      
    21 The applicant has appeared unrepresented on this application. He identified his grounds of appeal in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. They never got me up in the witness box. 
         
        2. They never took rehab into consideration. 
         
        3. They never got a pre-sentence report done.” 
        
       
      
    22 He provided written submissions in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. I was on Ice. 
         
        2. I was paranoid and when I stop for police I put the truck in neautral (sic) and I started to panick (sic) and 1st and reverse is in the same direction and I accident (sic) ramed (sic) it in reverse.” 
        
       
       
      The written submissions do not clearly relate to the grounds. 
       
      
    23 I will deal with each of the identified grounds first. 
     
      
       
      1. “They never got me up in the witness box.” 
       
      
    24 I take this ground to be a complaint about the manner in which his legal representative conducted the sentencing hearing. Generally speaking, an offender is bound by the manner in which legal representatives conduct the case. A ground of appeal complaining of the manner in which criminal proceedings are conducted will only succeed where a recognisable miscarriage of justice can be demonstrated, resulting possibly from “flagrant incompetence” or some other cause: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. 
     
      
    25 The decision taken by the applicant’s counsel at sentencing not to call him as a witness was one no doubt made in the exercise of his professional experience. There was a good deal of subjective material put before the sentencing judge, principally in the form of the psychiatric report. I would not infer, from the decision of counsel not to call the applicant, that any miscarriage of justice was caused. A decision not to call the applicant was a decision well within counsel’s professional discretion. 
     
      
    26 The first ground of the application cannot succeed. 
     
      
       
      2. “They never took rehab into consideration” 
       
      
    27 This is a complaint, not about counsel, but about an asserted omission on the part of the sentencing judge. It is true that there is no reference in the remarks on sentence to the possibility of rehabilitation. However, there is a great deal in the psychiatric report, to which the judge had regard. There was nothing in that to suggest that rehabilitation was a real possibility. I would reject the second ground of the application. 
     
      
       
      3. “They never got a pre-sentence report done” 
       
      
    28 It is not clear whether this is a complaint about counsel, the Crown, or the sentencing judge. Ordinarily, as I understand the procedure, a pre-sentence report is obtained from the Probation and Parole Service at the request of the sentencing judge, if requested by the defence. It usually forms part of the Crown material on sentence. There is no explanation why a pre-sentence report was not obtained in this case, or whether one was requested on the applicant’s behalf. Having regard to the applicant’s antecedents, it might be assumed that he was well known to the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
    29 All subjective matters were dealt with in the psychiatric reports. No miscarriage of justice has been caused by the absence of a pre-sentence report. I would reject this ground of the application. 
     
      
    30 I turn now to the applicant’s written submissions. The first is: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was on Ice.” 
        
       
      
     I take this to translate to an assertion that he was, at the time of the offences, affected by consumption of amphetamines. I do not regard this as in any way mitigating the offence and, if it were taken into account, it could not have helped him. In any event, the sentencing judge was well aware of his drug use and drug history.31 The same really applies to the applicant’s second submission, that he was “paranoid”. This, no doubt, resulted from his consumption of amphetamines. The balance of the submission suggests that his state of mind caused him to make mistakes in the manner of his driving. That is precisely the reason that the law prohibits driving when under the influence of drugs, and the reason that driving after consuming drugs is a serious offence. This could not have assisted the applicant in any way. 
     
      
    32 The applicant presented oral argument on the application. It was plain that he wished to pursue his complaint about the conduct of his counsel, and to challenge some of the facts that had been contained in the agreed statement of facts. However, nothing he said gave rise to any reasonable inference of error in the fact finding exercise, or wrong statement of what had occurred. Indeed, the applicant’s assertion that he had been on “Ice” and that he was “paranoid” would give little confidence in any account he could have given of the events in question. 
     
      
    33 The applicant also sought to restate a subjective case, concerning rehabilitation, and his wish to be available for his children. None of this is demonstrative of error in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    34 Accordingly, I see no basis on which to interfere with the sentences imposed. In my opinion they were well within the range of sentences available for very serious offences of this nature. 
     
      
    35 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

    1 SIMPSON J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: This an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon the applicant by Finnane DCJ (the Judge). The applicant had pleaded guilty before a magistrate to a number of offences contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and was committed for sentence to the District Court. She came before the Judge for sentencing for the following matters: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Committal for sentence: Knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) contrary to s 24(1) committed between 24.9.03 and 14. 11.03. 
         
         
        2. Count 1: Supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) on an ongoing basis contrary to s 25A committed between 28.4.05 and 24.5.05. 
         
         
        3. Count 2: Supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) contrary to s 25(1) committed on 25.5.05. 
         
         
        4. Count 3: Supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) contrary to s 25(1) committed between 1.6.05 and 10.6.05. 
         
         
        
       
      
    3 In respect of the manufacture offence the applicant asked the Judge to take into account a supply offence on a Form 1. In respect of the ongoing supply offence she asked the Judge to take into account a further supply offence (heroin) and an offence of disposing of stolen property on a 
     
      
       Form 1. The maximum penalty for each offence, other than the ongoing supply offence, is relevantly imprisonment for 15 years. The maximum penalty for the s 25A offence is imprisonment for 20 years. 
       
      
    4 On 9 June 2006 the Judge sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months to date from 10 June 2005. 
         
         
        2. Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 2 years to date from 10 June 2007. 
         
         
        3. Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 2 years to date from 10 June 2010. 
         
         
        4. Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months to date from 10 June 2010. 
        
       
       
      This amounts to an overall term of sentence of 10 years from 10 June 2005 with an overall non-parole period of 7 years 6 months to expire on 9 December 2012 the date upon which the applicant will be eligible to be released to parole. 
       
      
    5 The facts can briefly be stated. The applicant was in 2003 living in a de facto relationship with Ken Levy. He came to the attention of police for firearms matters and as a result lawful intercepts were placed upon the telephone in the house where the pair were living. Intercepted conversations over about a month revealed that the applicant and Levy were involved in the manufacture and supply of drugs. A search warrant was executed at those premises on 13 November 2003. As a result drugs and items used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine were located. The applicant was not arrested at that time. 
     
      
    6 In 2005 a controlled operation was established as a result of suspicions that the applicant was involved in the supply of drugs and dealing with stolen property from her home in Bexley North. An undercover operative named “Rodney” traded bottles of alcohol initially for a foil of heroin and then for small amounts of amphetamine. This gave rise to the s 25A offence. On one occasion the applicant spoke to Rodney about a stolen bike she had in her possession. This led to the receiving offence on the Form 1. Eventually he asked the applicant to obtain an ounce of the drug for him. She complied and he purchased the drug for $3,500. There was an arrangement for her to supply a further eight ounces at a cost of $3,250 an ounce but it did not eventuate before she was arrested. The applicant was then charged with all offences for which she was before the Judge. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was aged 58 years at the date of sentence. She has a criminal record dating from 1977 when she was fined in the Melbourne Magistrates Court for theft. In 1985 she was placed on a bond for conspiracy to defraud. That offence was incorrectly referred to in the antecedents placed before the Judge as a conspiracy to supply drugs. However, the facts were that she purported to an undercover officer that she was able to supply drugs for a price of $80,000 but after her arrest denied that she ever intended actually to supply drugs. In 1986 she was ordered to perform community service for a supply offence. In 1995 she was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years to be served by way of periodic detention for an offence of supply. The order of periodic detention was later cancelled and she served 45 weeks. In 1996 she was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months for supply. Thereafter she has been dealt with at various times for mainly traffic matters for which she was fined. In December 2005 she was placed on a bond for driving while disqualified. 
     
      
    8 There are four grounds of appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The learned sentencing judge failed to properly apply the principle of parity to the 2003 offence. 
         
         
        2. The learned sentencing judge failed to properly apply the principle of totality. 
         
         
        3. The learned sentencing judge over-estimated the objective gravity of the offences. 
         
         
        4. The learned sentencing judge gave insufficient credit for guilty pleas entered in the Local Court. 
        
       
      
    9 It is appropriate to leave the first ground of appeal to the last because a parity argument assumes that the sentence is otherwise correct. It seems to me that I should deal with the third ground first in order to determine what the totality of criminality was. 
     
      
    10 The Judge held that the applicant was “closely involved” in the manufacture of the drug in 2003 and was not a mere bystander as her counsel submitted. It was conceded that this interpretation was open to him. Yet later in the written submissions it is stated: “There was no evidence the applicant’s involvement in the manufacture offence was significant”. With respect this submission seems to be inconsistent with the earlier concession. In any event there were telephone conversations that on their face show her involvement in the manufacture. There are conversations about her possession of pseudoephedrine-based tablets, a precursor in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. There are conversations about the whereabouts of methylated spirits also used in the manufacture. She tells a person on the phone that she has sent a person to help make the drug more quickly. She receives instructions on how to dry out the drug from another person. 
     
      
    11 These and other conversations set out in the agreed statement of facts permitted the Judge to make the finding that he did. The applicant gave no evidence and declined to be interviewed by police. If she wished to have the Judge take a view that her involvement was less serious than it appeared to be, then she had the onus of doing so: R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. 
     
      
    12 The Judge held that “[the applicant] was throughout September, October and November of 2003 actively involved in manufacturing amphetamines and supplying drugs. That was her occupation.” It was submitted that this finding was not open on the evidence. In my opinion it was open to the Judge from the conversations set out in the facts to make that assessment of her involvement in the manufacture and supply of drugs. Whether or not it was her occupation hardly matters. It may have been a gratuitous remark but in my view it does not derogate from the valid finding that precedes it. 
     
      
    13 Later in his remarks the Judge referred to the applicant “as a career criminal drug dealer who has no intention of changing her ways”. I am prepared to accept that there may have been a measure of exaggeration in that description. But in light of the fact that the applicant had three prior offences of supply in her record, had an offence involving representations of supply to an undercover officer and had been involved in two separate episodes of supplying drugs for which she was before his Honour, it was clearly a case where denunciation and deterrence were highly significant matters. The only suggestion of any prospect of rehabilitation was her increasing age while in custody serving the sentences for the current offences. 
     
      
    14 It was submitted that the s 25A matter “did not involve the applicant in organising her affairs to minimise her risk rather she was responding to the opportunity [importuning?] of Rodney”. This submission is apparently referring to the Second Reading Speech of the Minister when the bill inserting s 25A into the Act was introduced. In R v Hoon [2000] NSWCCA 137 Dunford J said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [39] The section is directed to the concepts of repetition, system and organisation, and the objective criminality of any offence under the section should be determined by reference to those features, and not merely to the number and quantities of individual instances of supply. As pointed out in the Minister's Second Reading Speech in relation to the relevant legislation, the section is designed to: 
         
         
          
          "" ... target dealers who have organised their forces in such a way as to limit the full effect of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 . . . "" 
          
         
         
        He went on: 
         
         
          
          ""The amount of drugs which are supplied is immaterial to an offence under s25A, either within each individual offence or in total."" 
          
         
         
        [40] Obviously the section is primarily directed to those persons higher up the organisation than the respondents in this case, but the section is wide enough to cover ""runners"" such as the respondents, who can fairly be described as ""retail couriers"". 
         
         
        [41] Distribution networks cannot operate without those at the lowest levels and those persons play an essential part in the operation, albeit, a lesser role than those higher up in the organisation. Accordingly, offences under the section, even by persons fulfilling the functions performed by the respondents in this case, must be regarded as more serious than offences under s25. 
        
       
       
      Although his Honour was in the minority as to whether the sentence on a Crown appeal was inadequate, I do not understand there to be any dissention from his Honour’s characterisation of the offence. 
       
      
    15 I do not accept that there is some distinction to be drawn between persons who have and those who have not “organised their affairs in such a way as to limit the full effect of the [Act]”. The legislation was designed to target, amongst others, persons who are repetitive dealers in small amounts of drug to users. They can be street suppliers or stand further up the hierarchy. The purpose of the offence is to reflect their actual involvement in the distribution of drugs into the community beyond individual supplies considered in isolation. The Judge was entitled to act on the basis that the applicant was prepared to supply to persons who sought her out for that purpose, be it with money or goods to barter in exchange. The fact that she may have been responding to the police officer does not seem to me to be of any great significance. It is common in such offences that the supplier will have been the victim of a police “sting”. There is little other opportunity of getting evidence against them. Again the applicant gave no contrary version than that which appears from the bare facts. There was no suggestion that she would not have supplied drugs other than because of the approach by the police officer or that in some way she was pressured into offending. 
     
      
    16 It was further submitted that it was erroneous that the penalty for the agreement to supply was greater than the actual supply. I do not believe there is anything inconsistent or erroneous in that approach. As was explained in Vu v R [2006] NSWCCA 188, the seriousness of any particular activity falling within the concept of “supply” under the Act will depend upon the particular facts of the case before the court and no generalised statement can be made about the relative seriousness of differing forms of supply. There is no suggestion here, as there was in 1985, that the applicant had no intention of supplying that quantity of the drug. In the absence of evidence from the applicant, the facts should be taken at their face value and that she intended to supply that amount of drug but was denied the opportunity of doing so before her arrest. It was open to the Judge to sentence as he did. This ground is not made out. 
     
      
    17 The second ground is that the Judge failed to apply the principle of totality. It was noted that the Judge had not referred to the decision in Pearce or to the approach to sentencing for multiple offences that this decision advocates. However, it is acknowledged in the written submissions that the Judge did make orders clearly designed to address the issue of totality by making some sentences for the offences occurring in 2005 partially cumulative and making some concurrent. However, it was submitted that it was an error to fully accumulate the supply offences on the s 25A offence. In my view, notwithstanding that the 2005 offences all occurred from the one involvement with the undercover officer, the Judge was entitled to structure them as he did. 
     
      
    18 The real question is whether the overall sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months was too severe to deal with the total criminality of the applicant before the court. I am not persuaded that it was. I agree that there is merit in the complaint that the Judge referred to the applicant having been treated leniently by courts in the past. Without knowing the facts of the matters for which those courts sentenced the applicant, the Judge could make no valid assessment of the leniency or otherwise of those sentences. Not only did it have no foundation, it had no significant relevance to the exercise of the sentencing discretion. Even had she been treated leniently in the past, such a course would not justify a court increasing the sentence to be imposed beyond what was appropriate. As I have indicated, the Judge was entitled to take into account personal deterrence, but beyond that the earlier sentences had no significance. 
     
      
    19 Therefore, I understand that the applicant might well be aggrieved at the tone of the sentencing remarks containing as they did statements adverse to the applicant that had no evidentiary basis. But looking at the sentences imposed objectively they were, while heavy, justified by the seriousness of the applicant’s offending in light of her criminal history. 
     
      
    20 The fourth ground of appeal has merit. It complains that the Judge failed to give an adequate discount for the early pleas of guilty to all matters. As has been noted, the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court. Had she not pleaded guilty then clearly the Crown would have been put to considerable time and trouble in proving all the matters. There would presumably have been two trials. Therefore, there was a clear utilitarian value in the pleas that deserved proper recognition and an appropriate discount. With respect to the Judge this did not occur. 
     
      
    21 There was no reference to a discount for a plea of guilty during the sentencing remarks. Immediately after sentence was pronounced the applicant’s legal representative asked the Judge to indicate whether he had allowed any discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. The Judge responded: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I’ve fixed an overall 15 per cent.” 
        
       
      
    22 The applicant’s representative then asked whether the Judge would indicate his reasons for allowing “less than the recommended maximum”. The Judge responded: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The assistance for the administration of justice provided by her plea was of no greater significance than requires a fifteen per cent discount.” 
        
       
      
    23 One might quibble with the use of the singular in that answer but, with respect, this was no answer to the question. It was in effect no more than saying that the appropriate discount should be 15 per cent. It did not explain, or purport to explain, what it was about the applicant’s pleas in the Local Court that did not warrant a discount of somewhere near the top of the range specified in Thomson and Houlton when the two factors of significance, being an early plea and the avoidance of a complex hearing, had clearly been met. True it is that an offender has no right to any particular discount. It is also trite that the quantum of discount is a matter of discretion. But there is clearly an expectation, intentionally engendered in an offender by the guideline judgment, that an early plea especially in a complex matter would usually result in a discount of about 25 per cent. There is no reason apparent and certainly none given for why the discount in this case was significantly reduced from that which might have been expected. The discretion has to be exercised in a judicial fashion, and there is nothing in his Honour’s answer that indicates this was the case. There is nothing to which the Crown could point that justified a reduction in the discount that would normally follow pleas of guilty in the Local Court saving the State from at least two trials. 
     
      
    24 Further I note, as the Judge could himself have ascertained from the papers before him, that the co-offender in the 2003 matter was accorded a discount of 25 per cent. The sentences imposed upon this applicant do not themselves make it apparent that they were the result of a discount of 15 per cent. However, it seems to me that this ground is made out to the extent that the sentences imposed should be reduced by 10 per to give the applicant’s early pleas of guilty full weight. 
     
      
    25 The first ground of appeal complains of disparity in the sentence for the 2003 matter when compared with that imposed upon Mr Levy. He was arrested and charged in 2003. Like the applicant he was charged with knowingly take part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine and had taken into account a matter on a Form 1 being a similar offence of manufacture. Judge Hock sentenced him to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole of 18 months and a balance of term of 18 months. The allegation was that he manufactured more than an indictable quantity of 250 grams. He had a lengthy record including offences of supply and had previously served prison sentences but there had been no drug matters for a period of about 10 years. He was aged 53 at the date of sentence. The major matter of mitigation was that he suffered from a chronic arthritis in the hip. He needed crutches to move about and was in constant pain. Judge Hock found that prison would be more onerous for him. 
     
      
    26 The Judge sentencing the applicant said on the question of parity: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Her record is significantly worst than his. She has no medical problems, there are no special circumstances and there is no reason to treat her in any way leniently. Nor is there any reason for me to impose on her the same sentence as was imposed upon him for that offence or consider a lesser one. In my opinion her role was probably equal to his, but she was prepared to be involved. Her exact position in the hierarchy of those who were involved cannot clearly be established as it very often cannot. She is actively established (sic) and deserves to be sentenced on that basis. There is no basis for extending the same leniency to her as was extended to him and I do not intend to do that. 
        
       
      
    27 Notwithstanding that he said that he was not finding special circumstances the sentence imposed for the 2003 offence was in effect five years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months which is less than the statutory proportion by the operation of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There was, therefore, on the face of it only a difference of 12 months in the non-parole periods which will be reduced by a further 3 months as a result of the success of the fourth ground of appeal. Further, there was a concurrence of 6 months between the 2003 offence and the sentence for the s 25A offence. The head sentence of the 2003 offence will be reduced by 6 months to reflect the extra 10 per cent discount. At the end of the day it does not seem to me that the sentences as adjusted could give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance and the ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    28 A reduction in the sentences by ten per cent results in an overall term of sentence of 9 years and an overall non–parole period of 6 years 9 months to date from 10 June 2005. The applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 9 March 2012. 
     
      
    29 Therefore, I propose that the application for leave be granted and the appeal allowed. The sentences imposed by Judge Finnane should be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. For the offence of manufacture and taking into account the Form 1, a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months from 10 June 2005 and to expire on 9 September 2007 with a balance of term of 2 years 3 months from 10 September 2007. 
         
         
        2. For Count 1, the s 25A matter and taking into account the Form 1, a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months from 10 March 2007 and to expire on 10 December 2009 with a balance of 1 year 9 months to date from 9 December 2009. 
         
         
        3. For Count 2, supply, a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months to date from 10 December 2009 and to expire on 9 September 2011 with a balance of term of 1 year 9 months to date from 10 September 2011. 
         
         
        4. For Count 3, supply, a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months to date from 10 December 2009 and to expire 9 March 2012 and a balance of term of 2 years 3 months to date from 10 March 2012 and to expire on 9 June 2014. 
        
       
      
    30 HISLOP J: I agree with Howie J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was tried and convicted upon an indictment which contained one count in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 8 January 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, supplied a prohibited drug, namely, cocaine, in an amount of 500.3 grams, being an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug.” 
        
       
      
    2 The charge was laid pursuant to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for the offence is a term of imprisonment for twenty years or a fine of $385,000 or both. The offence is subject to s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The standard non-parole period for the offence is one of ten years. 
     
      
    3 The appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of six years and six months with a further term of three years. He now appeals against his conviction on the grounds that the trial judge erred “in failing to give directions on the evidence of flight.” An application was also filed for leave to appeal against the sentence. However, this was not supported by any submissions and it is unnecessary to consider that matter further. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    4 In January 2004 the police were carrying out an investigation in the Wollongong area and had an intercept in place on the mobile telephone number of Goran Nikolovski. Conversations which were intercepted revealed that Nikolovski was involved in the drug trade with persons other than the appellant. One of the persons he was dealing with was a person called Zen. The intercepted calls indicated that Nikolovski was negotiating the purchase of cocaine from Zen.  
     
      
    5 It was accepted at the trial that the cocaine the subject of the indictment had come from Zen. However, there was a significant issue as to whether, as the Crown alleged, Nikolovski was acting as a broker between the appellant and Zen. The Crown case was that the cocaine which was recovered had been purchased by the appellant. The appellant’s case was that he had nothing to do with the transaction between Nikolovski and Zen and that his only role was as a courier for Nikolovski. He gave evidence to this effect. 
     
      
    6 Although many phone calls between Nikolovski and the appellant were recorded, the Crown alleged that only one of them revealed a conversation about drugs. The call was made on 8 January 2004 when the appellant and Nikolovski spoke of “going for a swim” and taking “sunscreen” and a “towel.” It was the Crown case that going “for a swim” was code for going to Sydney and “sunscreen” was the taking of protection in the person of Marcio Francisco. The reference to “towel” was said to be a reference to money.  
     
      
    7 When he gave evidence the appellant admitted that the code for going to Sydney to get the drugs was “going for a swim.” He denied that when he spoke of bringing “sunscreen” and a “towel” he was referring to protection and money but said he was using those words to give coded reference to “swim” more credence in case someone was listening to his conversation. 
     
      
    8 There was controversy in relation to other of the phone calls. In a phone call at 4.58 pm on 7 January 2004 between Nikolovski and Zen, Nikolovski said he was 95% sure he wanted “it” and he was going to get Zen to go half-way. This, the appellant said, showed that Nikolovski owned the cocaine and that his role was merely as a courier. 
     
      
    9 On 8 January 2004 the police were conducting surveillance in the Wollongong area. At about 7.35 pm they observed a blue Subaru motor vehicle travelling north on Mt Ousley Road. The appellant was driving the vehicle and had a passenger, Marcio Francisco. At about 7.45 pm a green Holden Commodore was also observed travelling north. Nikolovski was driving this vehicle. 
     
      
    10 The police followed the vehicles to the Ultimo area in Sydney where the Commodore parked on Ultimo Road facing north. The Subaru parked on Ultimo Road facing south. Nikolovski got out of his vehicle and walked across the road to the appellant and Marcio Francisco. 
     
      
    11 At about 8.58 pm the three men were seen walking together towards the Market City complex. At about 9.03 pm the appellant and Francisco were seen outside the 7-Eleven store at the intersection of Quay Street and Ultimo Road. At about 9.06 pm Nikolovski was seen with an Asian male person, Zen, near the Market City Tavern. Both men appeared to be making and receiving calls on their mobile phones. At about 9.20 pm the appellant was seen to return to the Subaru and obtain a white hooded jumper, which he put on and a black “bumbag” which he placed diagonally across his back. 
     
      
    12 At about 9.23 pm the appellant, Nikolovski and Zen met in the Market City Tavern. They went from there to the 19th level of the Peak Apartments building in Haymarket. They were together in a unit on the 19th level for about 2 hours. Francisco remained outside, walking around the Haymarket area. The appellant gave evidence that during the time that he was in the Peak Apartments building he was not party to any drug transaction. The appellant and Nikolovski left the unit together. The appellant said that on leaving the unit he was given a General Pants Co plastic bag by Nikolovski. They then met up with Francisco and all three returned to the Subaru. 
     
      
    13 The appellant said when they got to the car Nikolovski asked him to get the money from the car. The appellant said he put the General Pants bag on the front driver’s seat and reached into the back and retrieved the bag containing the money – a Hugo Boss bag. He said that Nikolovski emptied the contents of the General Pants bag onto the front seat. The appellant said that he then saw a blue shopping bag and within that bag he could see a red bag. He said that he also saw a set of scales and white gloves which he said had come from the General Pants bag. He said that Nikolovski then took the money from the Hugo Boss bag and filled the General Pants bag with that money. Nikolovski allegedly told the appellant to take the package to Wollongong and he would contact him later to pick it up. Nikolovski said he was going to stay in Sydney. 
     
      
    14 The appellant alleged that Nikolovski told him there was still money in the Hugo Boss bag and the appellant was to take the scales to Wollongong and throw out the gloves. It was the defence contention that Nikolovski left with the bag of money to pay Zen for the cocaine. 
     
      
    15 The appellant then placed himself in the driver’s seat with Francisco in the passenger seat of the Subaru. Nikolovski left the area and returned to the Peak Apartments carrying a plastic bag. The appellant said he put the Hugo Boss bag in the back seat, the package under the driver’s seat, the scales in the glove box and passed the gloves to Francisco and asked him to “chuck them out.”  
     
      
    16 The Subaru was subsequently pulled over in the Haymarket area. The police told the appellant that they had information that there were drugs in the car and checks needed to be done. The appellant gave his licence and the car keys to the police. Whilst the police were conducting checks on the vehicle the appellant and Francisco ran from the car. The appellant took the package he had put under his seat with him.  
     
      
    17 The appellant was subsequently apprehended. Whilst running from the car he threw a bag under a red Mercedes motor vehicle. That bag was later found to contain cocaine. It had the words “Red Gold Riven, Little Hay Street” written on the outside. The appellant said he did not know what type of drug was in the package, nor its weight. He claimed that the drugs belonged to Nikolovski. 
     
      
    18 When the Subaru was searched $6,000 was found inside the Hugo Boss bag. The scales and gloves were found to contain traces of cocaine. The appellant’s mobile phone was found in the “bum bag” he was wearing. It also revealed traces of cocaine. The appellant said he did not know in what circumstances his phone came into contact with cocaine. The cocaine was found to weigh 500.3 grams with a purity of 83.5%. 
     
      
    19 Nikolovski was arrested that evening. He had his mobile phone with him. Apparently it rang a number of times and the name “Zen” was displayed as the caller. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s explanation for running away 
       
      
    20 At the appellant’s trial Const Molloy gave evidence of pursuing the appellant. He said he saw him throw a plastic bag underneath a red Mercedes following which he tackled the appellant and brought him to the ground. When he gave evidence the appellant sought to explain why he had run from the car. The following exchange occurred; 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So why were you worried, what were you worried about? 
         
        A. Well I knew I had the drugs in the car and the officer is coming to the car and he said to me he’s going to search the car for drugs and I was worried that I was going to be caught … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you ran from the car, grabbed the bag, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes I grabbed the package from underneath the car and I’m pretty sure I put it into my right hand. I stepped out of the car and just started running straight down. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you take the drugs with you, why didn’t you just leave them in the car? 
         
        A. Well the officer had my licence and he had the keys to the car and I thought if I left them there and I ran without them then its going to come back to me anyway and I thought if I run with them and I get away from the police, I’m obviously not going to get caught.” 
        
       
      
    21 When cross-examined the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So you ran away from the police, were you trying to escape from them, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were trying to avoid arrest? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were hoping to be able to get away and give the drugs to Mr Nikolovski is that what you say? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    22 Later he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Why didn’t you leave the package behind? 
         
        A. I didn’t leave the package behind because if I had run and left the package behind, I knew that the officer had my licence and he knew who I was so like he put one and one together I’ve left the drugs there in the car and they’re going to say they’re mine.” 
        
       
      
    23 When addressing the jury, defence counsel referred to this evidence and submitted the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is the question of running away and the flight. The Crown suggests you can look at that to assist his case on that beyond a reasonable doubt, that you might think it makes a lot of sense when the police officer says I just want you to hang around a bit, there’s some uniform people coming to search your car and we suspect you’ve got drugs and Mr Ristevski tells you well I’ve already given them the car keys and he’s got my licence, they know exactly who I am. If I do the bolt and leave the drugs in the car, it’s going to come back and haunt me, so I’m going to take my chances and run with it and hopefully not get caught with it. Is that so strange? Does that merely help prop up the Crown case up any more or not? I submit to you it doesn’t diminish the defence one iota.” 
        
       
       
      The summing up 
       
      
    24 There was no issue but that the drugs had been in the possession of the appellant. However, the nature of the appellant’s possession, whether he had them for the purpose of supply or whether, as the appellant alleged, he merely held them for Mr Nikolovski was in issue. Before the appellant could be convicted the jury also had to be satisfied as to his knowledge of the quantity of the drugs. This latter issue featured significantly in the trial judge’s summary of the Crown case. Relevant portions of her Honour’s summary were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown can satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt by showing you or demonstrating to you, or satisfying you that the accused actually knew or that the accused had a belief falling short of actual knowledge, or was aware of the likelihood in the sense that there was a significant or real chance that the amount of the prohibited drug consisted of in excess of 250 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        Now what does the Crown submit to you to establish this intent or knowledge? (1) the long friendship with Mr Nikolovski; (2) the previous knowledge that Mr Nikolovski was a drug dealer; (3) the immediate knowledge when asked to participate in a deal with Mr Nikolovski that this involved drugs; (4) the acknowledgment that he was to be paid $1,000.00 in cash to drive the drugs back to Wollongong and the acknowledgement that this was a large amount of money; (5) the knowledge that Mr Nikolovski had been charged with drug offences at the time he agreed to participate in this drug deal; (6) the borrowing of a WRX which he acknowledged was a fast car; (7) the taking of Mr Francisco whom both the accused and Mr Nikolovski knew had a history of violence; (8) the fact that the accused carried the money that he knew was for the drug deal; (9) the fact that the accused was inside the Peak Apartments for about 2 hours while he knew the drug deal was going down; (10) the fact that he knew they were checking the drugs for purity and it was taking some time; (11) the fact that he carried what he knew were drugs out would have felt the weight of the package or packages; (12) the fact that in the Subaru Mr Nikolovski tipped the drugs out, revealing scales, a set of gloves and a 10 centimetre by 15 centimetre by 5 centimetre package that the accused must have known contained drugs; (13) the fact that the accused saw Mr Nikolovski fill a General Pants bag with money; (14) the fact that the accused did not worry when he was pulled over for a traffic violation but panicked when it became apparent the car was to be searched; (15) the fact that the accused ran away with the drugs clutched in his hand; (16) the fact that the accused violently resisted arrest; (17) the fact that the accused went up to the unit at all, if his job was simply to courier the drugs back to Wollongong he would wait outside … collect the package and drive back to Wollongong; (18) the fact that he had the money, the scales, the drugs, the gloves in the car he was driving; (19) the conversations with Mr Nikolovski and Zen, particularly the one where Nikolovski says ‘I was going to get to go half way’ 7/01/04 at 16/58/53; (20) the reference to your friend indicating that Mr Nikolovski was doing a deal for a friend whom the Crown submits is the accused; (21) the conversation about the towel, the sunscreen and the swim, this is acknowledged, the Crown submits to you, as a code or it was acknowledged as a code, the code comes from the accused the Crown says, he is arranging protection. He is arranging the money.” 
        
       
       
        
        … the defence contend that there is no evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had actual knowledge that the package of cocaine in his possession weighed 250 grams or more. I will remind you that there are three aspects of it, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, actual knowledge, belief falling short of actual knowledge or was aware of the likelihood in the sense that there was a significant or real chance that the drug consisted of a commercial quantity. The accused said in evidence that he did not pay attention to the weight of the package when he took possession of it from Mr Nikolovski. At the time the cocaine was in a Clip Lock bag, which was in the Riven bag which was in the blue plastic bag, all of which was in the General Pants bag as well were the cotton gloves and the scales. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Ristevski said he did not know and was not told what quantity of drugs were in the General Pants carry bag … The defence says there is no evidence that at any time the drugs were in the possession of the accused did he form the belief that the drugs weighed 250 grams or more. They of course say there is no evidence whatsoever … of actual knowledge. The defence says there is no evidence from which it can be established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused held the belief while the drugs were in his possession that the drugs weighed 250 grams or more. The defence says that you could not infer from the circumstances in which Mr Ritevski carried the bags from the apartment to the WRX and then from the WRX until he threw them under the Mercedes, a belief in the accused that he knew he had possession of 250 grams or more.” 
        
       
      
    25 To this point in the summing-up no reference had been made to “flight.” The circumstance of the appellant’s attempt to escape from the police was identified as one matter in the chain of events giving rise to the offence. 
     
      
    26 The only reference by her Honour to “flight” was at a later point when her Honour was referring to the submission of defence counsel. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Flight, or running way I suppose it would be described as, Mr King says there is a logical explanation for this and it does not in any way, Mr King submits to you, diminish what Mr Ristevski has said to you about what his role was and what he intended to do with the drugs.” 
        
       
      
    27 There were no directions given in relation to the use if any which may be made of evidence of flight. Neither the Crown or counsel for the appellant sought such a direction. 
     
      
       
      The submissions 
       
      
    28 The appellant submitted that evidence of the appellant’s flight was a significant matter in the Crown case. It was said, although this was denied by the Crown, that it had been advanced at the trial as evidence that the appellant was conscious of his guilt of the offence with which he was charged. It was submitted that her Honour should have given the jury a direction which contained the following elements: 
     
      
       
        
        That before evidence of flight can be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt in support of the Crown case the jury must be satisfied that: 
        
       
       
        
        1. That accused did in fact flee (there was no issue on this point); 
        
       
       
        
        2. That the flight related to a material issue – here the issue was whether the appellant was in possession for the purpose of supply and not just mere possession; 
        
       
       
        
        3. He fled because he was in fact in possession for the purpose of supply – out of a consciousness of guilt; 
        
       
       
        
        4. The flight must be capable of indicating a consciousness of guilt specific to the offence charged. 
        
       
      
    29 It was submitted that the jury should have been warned that a person may flee for reasons other than guilt eg panic, or being wrongly accused. Furthermore, it was submitted that before the evidence could be used as consciousness of guilt, the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant sought to flee to escape arrest for the offence with which he was charged. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the appeal 
       
      
    30 The evidence of the appellant’s attempt to escape from the police was admitted without objection. This was inevitable, because it formed part of the sequence of events which revealed the appellant’s connection with the drugs he had discarded. For this reason the Crown, and her Honour when summarising the Crown case, included a reference to the fact that the appellant panicked when it became apparent that the car would be searched causing him to run away. To my mind it was not relied upon as evidence of consciousness of guilt of the offence as charged. It was merely an incident which, together with the other evidence, comprised the circumstances from which the jury could be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt. 
     
      
    31 However, if it be accepted that it was relied upon as evidence of consciousness of guilt I do not believe that any directions beyond those which her Honour gave were required in this case. The necessity for a special direction comes from the risk that the jury may reason towards guilt when there may be other, and innocent, explanations for the accused’s actions. The same position arises with lies told by an accused. Although many people would be aware of the possibility of an innocent explanation, unless reminded, there is a risk that the jury, being aware of the flight or lie, which is capable of having a powerful impact, may, without adequate reflection, convict an accused. 
     
      
    32 The relevant principles were summarised by Simpson J in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [50]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where evidence of flight is relied upon as evidence of a consciousness of guilt, the principles of law applicable to directions which must be given to the jury are, in my view, identical to those which govern the directions to be given to a jury where lies are relied upon as such evidence. Those principles are stated in  
        Edwards 
        ,  
        Zoneff 
         and  
        Heyde 
        . The conventional direction in relation to lies drawn from those, and other cases, requires a degree of adaptation in order to be accommodated to evidence of flight relied upon by the Crown for the same purpose. In particular, it is necessary, in my opinion, to draw attention to the circumstance that an accused person may behave in a way suggestive of a recognition of guilt for reasons other than such recognition of guilt – for example, fear of being unjustly accused. It is also necessary to point out to the jury that the consciousness must be a consciousness of guilt of the specific offence charged, and not, for example, of some other offence or some other discreditable conduct. The flight (or lie) may only be used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt of the offence charged where the jury is satisfied that it points unequivocally to consciousness of guilt of that offence and not some other offence or discreditable conduct. 
        
       
      
    33 Only one qualification may be necessary to her Honour’s remarks. Her Honour speaks of the jury being satisfied that the lie or flight points unequivocally to consciousness of guilt of the relevant offence. In Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ emphasized that unless the alleged lie is the only evidence against an accused, or an indispensable link in the chain, it does not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt (p 210). 
     
      
    34 In the present case it was plain that the appellant sought to escape in order to avoid apprehension for an offence relating to the drugs he had discarded. He said that he did so because he might be wrongly accused of possessing the drugs. His counsel reminded the jury of this explanation and her Honour, in summing up, also reminded them of it. No other explanation was offered. It follows that there was no reason for the trial judge to remind the jury that persons may have reasons to flee other than from a consciousness of guilt. The issue was properly placed before the jury. 
     
      
    35 I have indicated that no application was made for the trial judge to review the directions her Honour had given or provide any further directions. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. Although I am satisfied that there were no tactical reasons why this course was taken by defence counsel, it would seem that counsel had no reason to be concerned that the issue had not been appropriately placed before the jury. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

    1 SIMPSON J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The Crown has appealed against sentences imposed upon the respondent by Judge Ashford (the Judge) in the District Court following the respondent pleading guilty to one count of armed robbery with wounding. This is an offence contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 in respect of which there is a maximum penalty prescribed of 25 years imprisonment. There is an applicable standard non-parole period of 7 years. There were two related offences before the court under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1987, a common assault and being in custody of an offensive implement. 
     
      
    3 On 17 November 2006 the Judge imposed a sentence for the s 98 offence made up of a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of 1 year. The sentence commenced on 22 August 2005 and the respondent is eligible for release to parole on 21 August 2008. In respect of the s 166 offences her Honour imposed sentences of 4 months on each to be served concurrently with the robbery offence. The date of the commencement of the sentences was that upon which the respondent commenced the balance of parole for a previous offence. 
     
      
    4 The facts can be stated briefly. The respondent, who was on parole for armed robbery, entered a jewellery store. He had a toy pistol visibly stuffed down the front of his pants. He approached the storeowner and demanded gold from the display cabinet, threatening to kill him if he did not comply. The owner refused and the respondent presented the knife. The respondent reached forward striking at the victim who stepped back in fright. However, he was stabbed in the face, the knife completely penetrating his cheek. 
     
      
    5 The respondent ran from the scene chased by one of the bystanders. At one stage the respondent stopped and threatened the pursuer with the knife. Eventually police arrested him. The knife and toy pistol were located in a backpack. When questioned about the incident the respondent claimed that the storeowner had threatened him with a gun during a dispute and he had picked up the knife from a workbench to defend himself. However, the incident was captured on a security camera in the store and showed the respondent threatening the storeowner. 
     
      
    6 The victim received a number of stitches to his cheek and mouth but fully recovered physically although he was receiving psychological assistance to overcome stress caused by this and other later incidents at the shop. 
     
      
       
        
        Subjective factors 
        
       
      
    7 The respondent is aged 35 years. He had been paroled for an offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon on 4 May 2005. At the time of being sentenced he was serving the balance of parole of about 10 months from 17 February 2005 and expiring on 27 December 2005. The parole order was revoked on 22 August 2005. He has a criminal record dating from March 1982. He has numerous offences of assault and dishonesty mostly dealt with by bonds until he was sentenced to imprisonment in 1993 for an offence of sexual assault. In that year he was also sentenced for assault with intent to rob. In 2001 he was placed on a bond for malicious damage. On 18 December 2002 he was sentenced to imprisonment for armed robbery, the offence for which he was on parole at the time of the present offending. 
     
      
    8 There was a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Nielssen. The respondent told the psychiatrist that he stabbed the victim because he thought “he was having a go at me”. He said that when released to parole he was under treatment and taking medicine until he remarried and moved from his mother’s home to live with his wife. He stopped taking medication about eight months before the offence. He started taking ice and ecstasy and was affected by drugs at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    9 The respondent has a history of mental health issues mainly for drug induced psychoses but with a family history of mental illness. He had two admissions to a psychiatric hospital for drug induced psychosis. He has been treated with anti-psychotic medication while in gaol. He reported that during one period of imprisonment he tried to hang himself and suffered brain damage as a result. As a consequence he suffers from epilepsy. The respondent has been a poly-drug user and has for periods been treated with methadone. He was on a methadone programme when interviewed by the psychiatrist. The respondent stated to the psychiatrist that he was aware that using ice brought on symptoms of psychotic illness. He has Hepatitis C. 
     
      
    10 The respondent was diagnosed as suffering from post hypoxic brain damage, chronic schizophrenia and substance dependence and abuse. The psychiatrist stated that each of the illnesses increased his propensity to commit offences on impulse. However, there was no indication that the offence was committed as a result of any mental illness. The psychiatrist stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The effect of intoxication and the combination of his psychiatric disorders would be to greatly increase [the appellant’s] tendency to act in an aggressive way without considering the consequences of his actions.” 
        
       
      
    11 The psychiatrist reported that the respondent had “significant impairment in several areas of intellectual functioning as a result of his various disabilities”. He suffered “impaired concentration and ability to persist with tasks, impaired planning and problem solving, impaired emotional regulation and impulse control”. 
     
      
    12 There was information before the Judge to indicate that the respondent had completed courses in relapse prevention, communication and relationships. He was also having drug counselling. There was some sign of his accepting responsibility for his conduct and an understanding of the changes he must make to his behaviour. The psychiatrist thought that he would require intensive supervision and support at the time of his release. 
     
      
    13 The respondent’s mother gave evidence before the Judge. She indicated that the respondent had displayed troubled behaviour as a child and sought help with him from the age of 13. He was made a ward of state at 14 in order to try to offer him intensive assistance. However he failed to respond and was returned to home at age 18. Shortly thereafter he went to gaol and had been in and out of custody ever since. His mother felt that for the first time her son had tried to be compliant while on parole. She believed that without drugs and taking his medication he could function appropriately. 
     
      
       
        
        Sentencing remarks 
        
       
      
    14 The Judge referred to the statements in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 as to the relevance of drug addiction and noted that it was not a mitigating factor in the commission of an offence. Her Honour found that the offence was aggravated by the actual use of violence, that the offence was planned and that it was committed while the respondent was on parole. The Judge accepted that the respondent had a mental disorder and that s 21A(3)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act might be relevant but held that his mental disorders were “not such as to substantially affect his capacity to understand the effects of his action or to substantially affect his understanding of the authority and requirements of the law”. 
     
      
    15 Her Honour noted that general deterrence should be given less weight because of his mental disorder and believed that there should be “some diminution in sentence by way of general deterrence by reason of his reduced responsibility”. The Judge found special circumstances “relevant to rehabilitation, given his need for ongoing treatment and his expressed desire to do so”. 
     
      
    16 In the last paragraph of the sentencing remarks the Judge stated that the offence was “in the mid range of criminality, having taken into account the use of the knife to inflict damage to the victim but taking into account also his mental health issues”. In passing sentence the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I sentence you to a term of imprisonment. I do not fix a standard non parole period because of the plea of guilty. The sentence will consist of a non parole period of three years. I sentence you to a total term of four years imprisonment to date from 22 August 2005”. 
        
       
       
        
      Crown submissions 
      
    17 The Crown submits that the sentence is manifestly inadequate but asserts three particular errors being: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I. Failure to consider and apply the guideline judgment in Henry; 
         
         
        2. Failure to consider the standard non-parole period as a guidepost; 
         
         
        3. Structuring the sentences so that they were all concurrent and backdated so that they were all served concurrently with the balance of parole 
        
       
      
    18 The Crown submits that the Judge ought to have had some regard to the guideline in Henry when determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the respondent notwithstanding that the offence before her Honour was more serious. At least, so it is argued, the guideline in Henry would have provided the Judge with a bottom line upon which the aggravated features of this offence would have operated. In the Crown’s submission the range of 4 to 5 years indicated for a s 97 offence should have provided her Honour with an indication that a sentence of 4 years was manifestly inadequate for an offence under s 98 having regard to the matters of aggravation attending this offence such as the wounding, that the respondent was on parole and the fact that the maximum penalty was greater for the offence charged. 
     
      
    19 It was submitted by the Crown that the Judge, having determined that the offence was in the midrange of seriousness, should have fixed a non-parole period that was closer to the standard non-parole period notwithstanding that the respondent had pleaded guilty. It was contended that the Judge failed in accordance with s 54B(4) to indicate sufficiently those factors that permitted her to depart from the standard non-parole period apart from the plea of guilty: Marshall v R [2007] NSWCCA 24. It is argued that the Judge did not indicate that she was using the standard non-parole period as a reference point and that, if she had done so, she would not have departed so far from it having regard to the aggravating factors of the preset offence, particularly the fact that the respondent was on parole. 
     
      
    20 The Crown complains that all offences were made concurrent within themselves and with the balance of parole. The Crown refers to Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58 in which it was held that, where the offending occurs a short time after release to parole and the balance of term to be served is short, the Judge would be entitled to impose the new sentence cumulative to the balance of term. 
     
      
       
        
        Respondent’s submission 
        
       
      
    21 Mr Dhanji for the respondent reminded the Court of the well known principles that apply to a Crown appeal and quoted the passage from R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 where Wood CJ at CL summarised them. It is unnecessary to set them out here but they guide the decision as to whether the Court should allow the appeal and, if so, the discretion as to the sentence to impose in substitute of that determined by the Judge. 
     
      
    22 In respect of the submission about the failure to apply Henry the respondent argued that a s 98 offence carries a standard non-parole period of 7 years and this fact in effect takes over from any significance the guideline judgment in Henry otherwise would have. It was submitted that it would be wrong to start with the guideline provided in Henry and apply or detract aggravating of mitigating factors to derive a sentence. 
     
      
    23 While accepting that the Judge “might not have been explicit in identification of the facts leading from a departure from a standard non-parole period”, the respondent submitted that the Court could determine her reasons from the whole of the sentencing remarks. It was noted that although the Judge found the offence to be objectively in the midrange of seriousness, she was prepared to allow “some diminution in sentence by way of general deterrence” and the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    24 The respondent submitted that it was open for the Judge to backdate the sentence to the revocation of parole and was not bound to take some other view based upon the decision in Callaghan. It was submitted that it was not open for the Judge to take into account the two offences dealt with under s 166 by reason of the restriction on sentencing contained in s 58 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In effect it was submitted that the Judge was restricted to the power of the Local Court to accumulate sentences: see s 168(3). 
     
      
    25 In oral submissions Mr Dhanji stressed that the case was an unusual one because of the additional factor of mental illness that underlay the respondent’s offending. It was argued that this factor “broadened the range” so that, although lenient, the sentence fell at the bottom of, but within, this range. 
     
      
       
        
        Determination 
        
       
      
    26 As has been noted, the offence under s 98 had a standard non-parole period of 7 years but a maximum penalty of 25 years. This Court has remarked about the problems that are posed for a sentencing court by a standard non-parole period that is out of proportion to the maximum penalty and the difficulty in determining the rationale of parliament in specifying a standard non-parole period that is well above or well below half the maximum penalty: see Marshall at [34]. 
     
      
    27 However, the Judge was confronted with a standard non-parole period that represented prima facie the appropriate sentence for an offence that was objectively within the midrange of offending for an offence of its kind after trial. The Judge determined that this offence was within the midrange of criminality taking into account the use of the knife but also having regard to the respondent’s “mental health issues”. I am prepared to act on that basis although it is in my opinion a favourable finding. The wounding was serious because it was intentional and gratuitous. As has been noted, the respondent was on parole for armed robbery, a fact not mentioned by the Judge when determining the level of seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    28 It has been noted in this Court that sentencing an offender who suffers from a mental disorder is no easy task. There are considerations that pull in different directions: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. But the fact that an offender does have a mental disorder does not necessarily result in a lesser sentence for that reason. A significant mental disorder suffered by an offender at the time of the commission of an offence can be relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion in at least four ways: R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255. It can mitigate the offender’s culpability and hence the objective seriousness of the offence. The impact of the mental disorder on the offender’s behaviour can mean that imprisonment is more difficult and onerous than might otherwise be the case. It can moderate the need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence. It can indicate that the offender presents an actual or potential danger to society. The Judge referred to only two of these matters. 
     
      
    29 It is difficult to see how the respondent’s psychiatric condition reduced the objective seriousness of the offence other than that he might act aggressively without foresight of the consequences. But as the Judge found that his capacity to understand his actions and “his understanding of the authority and requirements of the law” were not substantially affected, there was little reduction of his culpability arising from his mental disorders. In any event, his mental state at the time of offending was a result largely of his failure to take medication and his use of illegal substances. Yet he was aware of the relationship between illegal drugs and his psychotic thoughts. He admitted so much to the psychiatrist who reported to the court. As a condition of parole he was to undertake drug rehabilitation and clearly his use of illegal substances was itself a breach of his parole. In these circumstances it could be considered as an aggravating circumstance that the offender’s disordered mental state at the time of the offence was to a large extent a result of his use of drugs. 
     
      
    30 There was no evidence before the Judge that the respondent would find imprisonment more difficult or onerous because of his mental condition and therefore this matter was of no relevance. 
     
      
    31 The Judge thought that there should be a diminution of the need for general deterrence by reason of the respondent’s “reduced responsibility on account of his mental condition”. A moderation of the need to reflect general deterrence does not depend upon the offender’s reduced criminal responsibility. In the present case there was little, if any, reduction in his criminal responsibility for the reasons I have given. But in any event having regard to the fact that his criminality was largely a result of drug taking which itself was a breach of his parole, the diminution, if any, could have been very slight indeed. 
     
      
    32 But whatever mitigation there was in the reduced significance of general deterrence, it was offset by the very strong need to impose a sentence for the purpose of specific deterrence, a factor not mentioned by her Honour. This was not just because of the fact that the offence was committed while the respondent was on parole but because it had to be brought home to him that he could not use illegal drugs rather than his medication. The respondent was a potential danger to society because of his aggressive impulses when using illegal drugs and this meant that personal deterrence and the protection of the community were very important considerations. 
     
      
    33 In my opinion the submission that the mental health of the respondent reduced the otherwise appropriate range of sentences commensurate with the seriousness of the offence should be rejected. If this was the reason why the Judge reduced the sentence so far below the standard non-parole period, then with respect she was in error. I accept that, as Gleeson CJ points out in Engert, it is within the discretion for a judge to derive a sentence that reflects the various and competing aims of punishment. However the Judge in the present case does not appear to have properly undertaken that task. She appears to have considered only those facts that might act in mitigation of the sentence and yet on the facts before her they could not mitigate the sentence at all. As I have indicated, there is nothing in her remarks to indicate an appreciation of the danger that the respondent posed to the community by his mental condition and his use of drugs or the significance in this case of personal deterrence. 
     
      
    34 The relevance and role of the guideline in Henry in light of the standard non-parole period specified for the offence was raised in the submissions of the respondent. In answer to the Crown’s complaint that the Judge had no, or insufficient, regard to the guideline in Henry, the respondent argued that the standard non-parole period was more relevant. In my view the guideline in Henry has a reduced role to play in determining a sentence for s 98 offences even without the standard non-parole provisions. This is because of the increased maximum penalty for such offences by reason of the fact that there had been a wounding. Nevertheless, if a court imposed a sentence for a s 98 offence that was less than that proposed in the Henry guideline, that fact alone should cause the court to consider whether such a sentence could be justified in light of the increased seriousness of the offence as evidenced by the increased maximum penalty. Where all other factors are equal, it is axiomatic that a person charged with a s 98 offence should receive a heavier sentence than a similar offender charged with a s 97 offence. 
     
      
    35 But I do not see anything inconsistent between the Henry guideline and the standard non-parole period for the s 98 offence. The Henry guideline looks to the total sentence and it is dealing with the normal case for an offence under s 97. Therefore, it is considering an offence in the midrange of seriousness where the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. The sentence suggested in the guideline, however, is the end result of the application of the relevant s 21A matters to an offence objectively of midrange seriousness. So it takes into account the young age of the offender and the lack of serious record. It also takes into account a late plea. Bearing those matters in mind, it still represents a guide to the sentencing for related offences, such as an offence under s 98 even though that offence carries a standard non-parole period. It is another reference point but one indicating a range of sentences that would not normally be appropriate for a s 98 offence. 
     
      
    36 There is no reference by the Judge to the standard non-parole period being used as a guideline or reference point anywhere in her remarks. A reduction of the standard non-parole period by 25 per cent for the plea of guilty would be 5 years 3 months. The non-parole period specified was 3 years. In view of the Judge’s finding that the offence was of midrange seriousness and taking into account that the respondent was on parole, a seriously aggravating factor, that result should itself have given rise to some question in the mind of the Judge as to its appropriateness. If the Judge had then taken into account that a non-parole period of 3 years is roughly what might have been expected for an offence falling within the top of the Henry guideline after an early plea, then she should have asked herself why the sentence was so lenient. There is no reasonable answer to that question. 
     
      
    37 In my opinion, if the Judge had properly applied s 54B(4) and attempted to identify each of the factors taken into account in departing from the standard non-parole period, as the section requires, she must have seen that the sentence was too great a departure from the standard non-parole period. The only reason given for not imposing the standard non-parole period was the plea of guilty but that alone could not have justified such a substantial departure even with some further reduction due to the lessening of general deterrence had that been appropriate. In my opinion having regard to the fact that the respondent was on parole and his criminal record generally the offence itself warranted a sentence above the standard non–parole period. The only significant mitigating factor was the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    38 In my opinion the Crown appeal should be upheld. The Judge said that she found special circumstances “given his need for ongoing treatment and his expressed desire to do so”. In fact the non-parole period is 75 per cent of the total term, so that the Judge did not reduce the non-parole period to accord with this finding. As this is a Crown appeal the sentence should be moderated to have regard to double jeopardy and the respondent should receive the benefit of the finding of special circumstances. Further, I do not believe that the other offences under s 166 warranted any increase in the overall sentence to be served by the respondent even if the Judge had the power to impose cumulative sentences for those matters. 
     
      
    39 Callaghan indicates that it would be appropriate not to backdate the sentence in the circumstances that applied here. Her Honour apparently never considered whether or not she should backdate the sentence. The only reference to the balance of parole was that it had expired. The fact that the respondent was using drugs contrary to his parole conditions was a matter that might have indicated that the sentence should not have been backdated. But again having regard to the fact that this is a Crown appeal and the respondent’s sentence is to be significantly increased, I would not interfere with the commencement date. 
     
      
    40 I wish to make it clear that I have given the respondent the benefit of findings made by the judge even though I would not have come to those conclusions myself. For example, I would have found the offence more serious than midrange. I have taken into account an affidavit by the respondent as to his health issues in gaol and the further courses he has undertaken. The matters raised by him do not in my view indicate that the appeal should be dismissed as a matter of discretion or that the sentence should be significantly moderated other than by reason of this being a Crown appeal. I am departing from the standard non-parole period by reason of the discount for the plea of guilty and by finding special circumstances. 
     
      
    41 I propose the following orders. The Crown appeal is allowed and the sentence imposed by Ashford DCJ for the offence of armed robbery with wounding is quashed. In lieu the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years 3 months to date from 22 August 2005. The respondent is eligible to be released to parole on 21 February 2010.

    JUDGMENTRe Admissibility of Telephone Intercepts1 The Prosecution brings a charge alleging that the accused “knowingly took part in the supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of cocaine” between the dates alleged. The charge is brought pursuant to s.25 (2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.2 “Supply” is defined in s.3 of this Act and the meaning of “take part in” is set out in s.6 of the Act. Their relationship was discussed in R v Derbas (1993) 66 A Crim R 327 (at 329-30).3 I accept for the purposes of this judgment that the Crown does not have to prove an actual supply and that preparation for “supply” may constitute “knowingly taking part in supply” (R v Deng (1996) 91 A Crim R 81 (at 95-96): DPP’s Reference (No. 2 of 1995) 65 SASR 508).4 Objection has been taken, by the accused, to parts of two recorded telephone lawful intercepts sought to be tendered by the Crown. Both telephone conversations occurred on 14 January 2006, one at 11.01 pm, the other at 11.05 pm (conversations “A” and “B”). The seven conversations occur between 14 and 24 January 2006. I have excluded two specific parts of the second of such conversations, occurring at 11.05 pm on 14 January 2006. There is no incriminating evidence as such in conversation “A”, however the objection, as I understood it, was essentially concerned with its “relevance”, given the fact that it has the appearance of an innocent conversation so to speak. I note in relation to this matter that it is proposed by the accused to make admissions that he knew that the other participant in the telephone conversations (Johnny Kazzi) was a drug dealer, that the two men at various times were talking about “cocaine” and that he, the accused, had some association with the use of prohibited drugs.5 With regard to tape “A”, the significance of it, as I understood the Crown’s position, was that it first of all “sets the scene” for later more incriminating conversations and secondly, its significance is enhanced by the fact that it occurs only a few minutes before a particular conversation specifically concerned with the supply, or proposed supply, of prohibited drugs. It, in its final terms, leads into the second telephone conversation.6 The relevance of evidence is determined by the terms of s.55 Evidence Act 1995. I do not propose to set out that section beyond observing that on the basis that the conversation “A” sets the scene and has a temporal relationship with other more probative conversations, I would not regard the conversation as irrelevant. Furthermore, I see no unfair prejudice to the accused which would outweigh the probative value of the evidence, albeit slight (s.137 Evidence Act).7 The second conversation (conversation “B”) is objected to in part, particularly the statement made by the accused at page 1 of the transcript of the conversation “CV - Well you know like we did last time”, as well as that portion of the conversation from where the accused says (at p.2 of the transcript) “Mate, err, mate it all depends last time I did fuckin’ three with, them pretty quick …” to (at page 3) “JK – They’ve got a chunk missin’ out of them. 8 CV – Alright”.9 The objection is that this conversation involves representations by the accused that he has been involved in past supplies of prohibited drugs. It is submitted that this fact is irrelevant and even if relevant the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its unfair prejudice to the accused. It should be pointed out that parts of the first conversation at the end appear to segue into the substance of the discussions about prohibited drugs in the second conversation which occurs a few minutes later. 10 By reference to Question of Law (No. 1 of 1996) (1997) 92 A Crim R 364, Deng and DPP’s Reference (No. 2 of 1995) the Crown says that the conversations objected to are admissible as they are relevant to establishing “the process” that includes the charged conduct. I do not accept that submission in relation to those admissions, if they be so, of past supplies, or a past supply, by the accused in this matter. 11 I do accept, as was implicitly accepted in Question of Law No. 1 (above), that past supplies or separate supplies may be part of “the process” of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug the subject of a charge as arises in this matter. However in that judgment, the “facts” reveal that it was part of the Crown’s case that one accused’s “history of selling drugs” was relevant to the proof of guilt and this was not disputed. The details of that history however, are not recorded and one would assume there was greater particularity than available here. In order for the evidence to be relevant there must be sufficient particularity to relate those past events to the particular “process”, to use the term adopted by the learned Prosecutor, the subject of the charge. Otherwise, the evidence is simply evidence of “past bad character” not relevant and not admissible, unless relevant for “tendency” or “coincidence” purposes (ss.97, 98 Evidence Act 1995) or as permissible “contextual evidence”.12 To understand the importance of the conversations objected to I have also taken into account other material in other conversations, including the reference by the accused to “burning bridges” in the last conversation recorded. That comment, in its terms, may be more “contemplative” than “historical”. It is equivocal at best. I have also taken into account what the Crown outlined to be the proposed evidence of Mr Messina, which may shed light upon matters referred to by the accused during the objected conversation, such as Kazzi’s reference to “some black … wrapping …” to which Mr Vera replied “OK, that’s the one, yeah”. It must be fairly said that in its terms not all of the objected material may, or potentially may, reveal past supply conduct. Other parts of the conversations objected to reveal evidence of the accused’s knowledge of Mr Kazzi’s methodology, without admission of past supply. This evidence is not only relevant to the issues in the case for determination as contended by the Crown, but also the accused’s relevant knowledge and intention to supply. This evidence has no unfair prejudice that outweighs its probative value (see s.137 of the Act). No relevant unfair prejudice in the material was identified during the submissions in any event.13 But in relation to the evidence that I yesterday rejected, it should also be pointed out that in its terms the second conversation (“B”) contemplates a supply which is a separate process from any previous supplies purportedly admitted by the accused. This appears to me to be clear when one considers the introductory comments of the accused in this second conversation “Yeah, no, like what I was saying, is alright like he just leaves me one to play with, you know what I mean … but I’ve got a few people that want, you know, quick”. That seems to suggest a “separate transaction” from other previous transactions.14 It is in these circumstances, given the lack of particularity as to the timing of previous supplies, that I excluded the evidence of conversations that could reasonably be construed as admissions of past supply of prohibited drugs as irrelevant.15 If I am in error in excluding the material as “irrelevant”, I would have excluded it in exercise of the discretion available pursuant to s.137 of the Act. Its probative value as evidence of the “process” charged is greatly diminished by its lack of particularity. That the accused supplied to the same people, with Kazzi’s assistance, at an earlier time than that contemplated in the charge does little to establish his intention at the time particularised in the indictment. The unfair prejudice of this material is profound. An admission of prior conduct of a similar nature would have clear prejudice which would be unfair to the accused proportionate to the diminishing probative value. This evidence in its terms would tempt the fact finders to use the evidence on an improper basis, i.e. because the accused may have done this before, therefore he is guilty of this particular crime. This is not a case where prior conduct could rationally inform present intention. The further in time the past conduct of the accused, the less connected it would be to the “process” of which the Prosecutor spoke in his submissions. Even with the benefit of Mr Messina’s evidence the ‘connectedness’ of the events would wind up being a matter of fruitless speculation without other evidence.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      1. I will deliver judgment in the matter of Michael McKenzie who is in Court. Michael McKenzie has been charged with a series of very serious offences. Three of those offences concern events which are alleged to have occurred between 1 January 2002 and 8 April 2003. For that period he is charged with one count of sexual intercourse with a child under ten which carries a maximum sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment, one count of indecent assault on a child under ten and a further count of inciting a child under ten to commit an act of indecency. There is a statutory alternative pleaded to the first count. In addition, he is charged with two offences arising out of events which allegedly occurred between 26 December 2004 and 31 January 2005. Both counts are of sexual intercourse with a child under ten, the second count having an alternative. 
       
       
      2. In respect of the first period the brief facts are that the accused is alleged to have placed his penis in the vagina of a six year old girl to whom he was the de-facto uncle. In addition he is alleged to have kissed her on the neck, body and the lips as well as telling her to place her hand on his penis. The allegations in respect of the second period concern the same girl who was then eight. It is alleged that he had suggested sexual intercourse to the girl who ran away and locked herself in the toilet. The accused is said to have unscrewed the door handle, picked up the complainant and taken her to his bedroom. He removed her clothes, forced her legs apart and inserted his tongue into her vagina. This he followed with placing his penis into her vagina. 
       
       
      3. The accused was arrested on 18 July 2005 and declined to participate in an interview. 
       
       
      4. At some stage a question of his unfitness to be tried in respect of these charges was raised. Such a question triggers various procedures under the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
      . The accused purported to elect, with the consent of the prosecutor, to have the question of his unfitness to be tried determined by a judge alone. In a judgment dated 6 March 2007 I determined that I was satisfied that he had the capacity to so elect. Accordingly, the proceedings before me were an inquiry into Mr McKenzie’s unfitness to be tried for the offences with which he was charged. In accordance with s6 of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act  
      the question is to be determined on the balance of probabilities and in accordance with s 12(3) of that Act the onus does not rest on any particular party to the proceedings. Mr McKenzie was represented by counsel. 
       
       
      5. The prosecution evidence was a facts sheet and proforma notice from the prosecution concerning adducing a recorded interview with a child as well as the transcript of two electronically recorded interviews from 2001. The first of those interviews was also the subject of a video recording which I viewed in court. The prosecution also called Dr C L Wong, a consultant psychiatrist. The defence tendered reports from Associate Professor Susan Hayes and Dr Bruce Westmore as well as calling those two witnesses. The importance of the video recording of the ERISP was that it provided an opportunity for the various expert witnesses to view Mr McKenzie’s performance under police questioning so that they could comment on his capacity in that context. 
       
       
      6. I now turn to a review of the expert evidence before me. Dr Wong was called by the Crown. He said that in coming to an opinion regarding the ERISP he took into account the whole ERISP but paid special attention to particular parts which he had highlighted. He said that even leaving aside the ERISP he was still of the opinion that Mr McKenzie was, on the balance of probabilities, fit for trial but the ERISP reinforced that opinion. He did also express the view that whatever the disability was that concerned Mr McKenzie it was longstanding and that he did not expect any substantial change. Indeed he expected that that disability stemmed from his birth. 
       
       
      7. In being questioned about the records of interview and the police questioning in 2001 Dr Wong said in evidence that his opinion was that the questioning was tantamount to cross-examination and was quite adequately handled by Mr McKenzie in his opinion. He agreed that the cross-examination was not as skilful as would have been the case had he been cross-examined by lawyers but asked the rhetorical question, “ 
      It’s the same principle isn’t it? 
      ” He was of the view that the questioning amounted in effect to cross-examination and thought that the police probed him quite well during the interview. He thought that Mr McKenzie responded well and quite adequately to what Dr Wong regarded as some searching questions. Dr Wong was of the opinion that Mr McKenzie could handle court in the same way as a normal person. He acknowledged that the police in questioning Mr McKenzie were very friendly but added that he thought their questions were quite searching. He also thought that despite the friendly demeanour of the police Mr McKenzie was still able to present his case, that is deny any wrongdoing. 
       
       
      8. Turning to the question of whether Mr McKenzie had a communication problem, Dr Wong did not agree that he had a communication problem. He referred to the interviews which various experts had had with Mr McKenzie. He thought that these interviews demonstrated that there was not a problem, otherwise the doctors or rather the experts would not have obtained such a complex history, and there was no note in the experts’ reports of any problem with history. He was asked whether in handling the issue of his capacity to elect, Mr McKenzie had managed to deal with only a single issue. Dr Wong acknowledged that but said that it depends upon what one means by a single issue. He said that Mr McKenzie was asked to deal with several issues, the role of the judge, the idea of a judge alone trial, the role of a jury and the implications of each choice. 
       
       
      9. Turning to the question of whether the level of Mr McKenzie’s disability was mild or moderate, Dr Wong was of the opinion that Mr McKenzie’s disability was mild. The difference between mild and moderate was one quite significant feature Dr Wong said. It was in his opinion the ability to live in the community with or without supervision. He was of the view that Mr McKenzie could go about his daily tasks unsupervised and that was an opinion expressed by his family doctors who are quite familiar with him. 
       
       
      10. As to the psychometric testing undertaken by Associate Professor Hayes to which I will refer shortly, Dr Wong expressed the view that they were important in assessing a person’s intelligence but they needed to be seen in the context and in conjunction with other evidence. Dr Wong acknowledged that Mr McKenzie had difficulty with the concept of a prosecution as an institution but Dr Wong was of the opinion that Mr McKenzie was aware that the trial consists of an adversarial process. 
       
       
      11. Dr Wong was asked about Mr McKenzie’s capacity to concentrate during the length of a trial which might be several days up to five days. Dr Wong was of the opinion that regardless of the length of the trial the court rarely sits for more than two hours and Dr Wong could see no reason why, with appropriate breaks, Mr McKenzie would not be able to cope with the court process or at least have the capacity to concentrate. He in fact referred to evidence that Mr McKenzie is able to concentrate for more than two hours because of his interviews with the various experts. Dr Wong concluded by expressing the opinion that Mr McKenzie had met all of the criteria referred to in  
      Regina v Presser 
       [1958] VR 45 at 48. 
       
       
      12. Turning next to the evidence of Associate Professor Hayes called by the defence, Associate Professor Hayes had administered various intelligence tests. They were important because it demonstrated that Mr McKenzie had an intellectual disability and demonstrated the level of that disability. Associate Professor Hayes was of the opinion that Mr McKenzie needed assistance and the degree of the assistance depended upon the degree of the disability. Associate Professor Hayes listed the various tests which she had administered. She also indicated that the various levels of intellectual disability range from borderline (in a 70 to 80 IQ) to mild (50 to 70 IQ), moderate (35 to 50 IQ) and severe (20 to 35 IQ). A profound disability was an IQ of less than 20. Mr McKenzie’s overall score in 2001 was 40 and in 2005 was 45. She assessed his level of disability as moderate and expressed the opinion that he was therefore in a category lower than 99.9 per cent of the population. His overall adaptive level was at about 50 so she regarded him on the border of mild and moderate and his social figure was about 53 which put him at the bottom of the mild range. 
       
       
      13. Turning to Mr McKenzie’s performance in the ERISPs Associate Professor Hayes was of the opinion that part of the ERISP was a narrative, telling a story of what he did on various days. She said that we have no idea whether or not it was accurate. She expressed the view that if there were leading questions Mr McKenzie was more likely to agree with the questioner. 
       
       
      14. Turning to the  
      Presser 
       criteria, she reported that Mr McKenzie could not tell her the charges and the best that he could manage was that he had touched a nine year old. He had no sense of the distinction for example between a sexual assault and an indecent assault. He did know the difference between pleading guilty and not guilty. However as to the right of challenge he did not understand, in her opinion, what a jury was so that he could not challenge. Being asked about his capacity, in the last day or two before she gave evidence, to elect to be tried by judge alone or at least to elect to have the inquiry by a judge alone, Associate Professor Hayes was of the view that in the past few days he had intensive tutoring about the role of a jury so that he was able to grasp at that stage what a jury was but she said that he will forget unless reminded each day. He regards them as twelve strangers. 
       
       
      15. As to his capacity to follow generally the nature of the proceedings she was of the view that he does not understand who the adversary is, although he knows the process is adversarial. Following the course of the proceedings she was of the opinion that he would not be able to do that because information would, as she termed it, decay overnight, so that each day he will take some in but will forget it overnight, being unable to retain the information. 
       
       
      16. Questioned about whether he would understand the evidence against him, she was of the opinion that he would be able to understand simple but not complex evidence. Asked whether more breaks in the proceedings would help she said that they would not really help because it was what was happening between the breaks which was what was important. There was still, in her opinion, a huge amount to take in, process, remember and reproduce himself if he wanted to instruct his legal counsel. 
       
       
      17. Questioned about Mr McKenzie’s capacity to make a defence or answer the charge she said that he does not really understand the idea of evidence, thinking that that is equivalent to documentary material. She reported that Mr McKenzie had told her that he did not know what giving evidence meant. She also reported significantly an opinion that Mr McKenzie could not place himself in the time span when the alleged offences happened. He regarded it as a family feud and repeated her opinion that he could not place himself in that time span. 
       
       
      18. Finally Dr Westmore addressed in his evidence before me the  
      Presser  
      criteria. Dr Westmore was of the opinion that Mr McKenzie has an understanding of what he has been charged with, at least the basics, that there was a sexual incident, and that he had a capacity to plead guilty or not guilty. These two areas were less of a problem in the opinion of Dr Westmore. 
       
       
      19. As to jury challenges, Dr Westmore was of the view that this was really impossible for a man of Mr McKenzie’s level of intelligence. Dr Westmore thought that Mr McKenzie would not have any idea about a jury, the difference between men and women, old and young, racial background, and would have to rely entirely upon his lawyer in order to register a challenge.  
       
       
      20. Insofar as the question of him understanding the nature of the charges were concerned Dr Westmore was of the opinion that Mr McKenzie’s major problem in this area was communication. He didn’t think that Mr McKenzie would be able to follow the course of the proceedings, in particular if they were around five days. Even one day or one hour might be a problem. Dr Westmore was of the opinion that it would be necessary to stop after every sentence and ask “ 
      Do you understand the question? 
      ” Asked whether the manner of questioning or breaks in the proceedings may assist, questioning which may take into account the needs of the witness, he was of the opinion that the ERISP did not indicate a capacity to undergo cross-examination. He regarded the questioning in the ERISP as fairly benign. He described it as kind, gentle and not containing any accusations. He thought that Mr McKenzie would not be able to give an account of himself. 
       
       
      21. He also regarded the setting of the ERISP as being relatively speaking fairly benign whereas in court there would be a different type of questioning where the probing would be more significant even if protected by the judge in accordance with the rules of evidence. 
       
       
      22. Hence the question for me is what is more likely? Is Mr McKenzie fit for trial or unfit for trial? Both conclusions are agitated with the support of expert evidence. Dr Wong’s views are persuasive, particularly coming from a forensic psychiatrist of his experience. However I think that Mr McKenzie would have real difficulties in facing a trial and I have decided on balance that he is unfit for trial. I come to that decision for the following reasons. 
       
       
      23. Firstly, the psychological tests administered by Associate Professor Hayes carry a degree of objectivity. Although, as Dr Wong says, they need to be seen in a wider context, they do indicate that Mr McKenzie is functioning in terms of his adaptive behaviour overall at a level lower than 99.9 per cent of the population. They also highlight his worst area of function as communication. 
       
       
      24. Secondly, I accept Dr Westmore’s description of the questioning in the ERISP as being fairly benign. Mr McKenzie was questioned, as Dr Westmore said, in a kind and gentle way with no confrontational accusations. I do not regard that questioning as tantamount to cross-examination which was Dr Wong’s view. 
       
       
      25. Thirdly, more specifically I think Mr McKenzie would fail to measure up in respect of the following requirements for fitness for trial as laid down in  
      Presser 
      .  
       
       
      26. Following the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense: although I accept that the provision in advance of a video of the complainant’s evidence will significantly assist Mr McKenzie in giving instructions, I also accept, as his counsel argues, that such a procedure will not be available in respect of the complainant’s cross-examination and in respect of other witnesses. There is, I gather, an issue about whether a complaint has been fabricated. Although as the Crown Prosecutor submitted, it appears that Mr McKenzie is able to assert that the allegations are false, that he was never alone with the complainant and that she was put up to it by her mother, there is still the problem of Mr McKenzie following the course of the proceedings, the evidence given by witnesses apart from the complainant and his ability to respond with appropriate instructions to his legal counsel. 
       
       
      27. It has to be acknowledged that an attempt might be made to manage the trial in the way suggested by the Crown Prosecutor, allowing for frequent breaks. However, Associate Professor Hayes says that information will deteriorate overnight, in the sense that Mr McKenzie will not be able to retain what he learnt on a particular day. As Associate Professor Hayes says there remains a huge amount for Mr McKenzie to take in, process, remember and then reproduce in order to convey to his legal representatives. Dr Westmore thinks Mr McKenzie would have to be asked whether he understood each question.  
       
       
      28. Next, in respect of making a defence or answer to the charge. I also accept Associate Professor Hayes’ evidence that Mr McKenzie will have a real difficulty in placing himself in the respective time zones. She referred to that in her evidence. In addition Dr Westmore was of the view that in this case the years of the allegations, a range of 2002 to 2005, would be a major problem for Mr McKenzie. Both sets of offences are alleged to have occurred over a period of time, some years ago. I think that will add to Mr McKenzie’s inability to make his defence and answer the charges.  
       
       
      29. Next, as for understanding generally the nature of the proceedings, I accept that although Mr McKenzie understands the fact that he is facing a court case he appears to attribute it to a family feud and has real difficulty understanding the role of the prosecution, a factor acknowledged to some extent by Dr Wong. As Associate Professor Hayes says, Mr McKenzie knows the proceedings are adversarial but does not understand who is the adversary. 
       
       
      30. As to exercising his right of challenge, both Associate Professor Hayes and Dr Westmore think Mr McKenzie will not be able to adequately exercise his right of challenge. I have referred to their evidence about this. For the above reasons I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr McKenzie is unfit for trial. Now Mr Jankowski, Miss Fleming, that has statutory consequences. 
       
      JANKOWSKI: The matter should be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal for assessment your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Just let me get the Act. Section 14 isn’t it? If following an inquiry an accused person is found unfit to be tried the proceedings brought against the person must not, except for the purpose of doing the things referred to in paragraph (b), be recommenced or continued and the court must refer the person that the Tribunal, and may discharge any jury. No. And may, pending the determination of the tribunal do any one or more of the following. Adjourn proceedings, grant person bail, remand the person in custody or make any other order as the court considers appropriate. So obviously I refer him to the tribunal. Now what about the s 14(b) options? Do you have an application? 
       
       
      JANKOWSKI: I have an application for bail. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Ms Fleming, what’s your attitude to that? 
       
       
      FLEMING: I’m instructed the Crown does not oppose bail continuing on the conditions as outlined previously. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Do we have those conditions. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Do we have those conditions somewhere Ms Fleming? 
       
       
      FLEMING: Yes your Honour I do have a notation. Would you like me to read them out? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Say that again. 
       
       
      FLEMING: I do have a record of those conditions. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Are they long? 
       
       
      FLEMING: There are five conditions your Honour.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: All right, what’s the date of those conditions? I’ll refer to them by date. 
       
       
      FLEMING: 5 October 2005, Supreme Court bail conditions and they were varied on 28 November 2005, conditions 2 and 4 were varied. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Good, I’ll come back to you on that. Anything either of you want to say about the orders? 
       
       
      JANKOWSKI: No your Honour. I think with respect to bail it just should be bail to a date to be fixed. It’s because the tribunal have to assess whether he will become fit within 12 months or not. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: It says bail in accordance with the Bail Act. What does that say about - do I have to fix a date? What does the Bail Act say? 
       
       
      JANKOWSKI: No as I understand your Honour doesn’t have to fix a date. It can be to a date to be fixed as I understand it. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Is that right? Isn’t that bail subject to an undertaking that somebody appears before the court on a particular day? 
       
       
      JANKOWSKI: It is your Honour but of course when one doesn’t know the date, for example when this matter was adjourned on the last occasion there was no date fixed because your Honour wasn’t sure which date your Honour would deliver judgment. So the condition on that occasion was that he be bailed to a date to be fixed. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: All right, I’ll just have a look at the Bail Act. 
       
       
      JANKOWSKI: I might just indicate that if your Honour is of the view that a date should be-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No I’m just trying to find out what my view is. Ms Fleming do you have a view on that, whether I have to fix a date? 
       
       
      FLEMING: Your Honour it would be my understanding that the matter could - as it is being referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal if it were made a condition of his bail that he report to that office within a certain number of days then in effect-- 
       
       
      JANKOWSKI: I don’t think that’s how it works. I think they just assess the matter on the documents your Honour. There’s no as it were requirement that he attend the tribunal for the purposes of that assessment. It’s not like Probation and Parole Service requirement your Honour. The papers are simply referred to the tribunal and then they determine the matter in the fullness of time in whichever way they consider fit. My recent experience with the tribunal is that it takes something in the order of two months for them to consider the matter. That’s more or less the range, although I must say that the case I’m thinking of did occur over the Christmas period, whatever that delay would mean your Honour. 
       
       
      31. In this case the orders I make are in accordance with s 14 of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
       I refer Mr McKenzie to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. I adjourn these proceedings to a date to be fixed and I grant Mr McKenzie bail in accordance with the  
      Bail Act 1978 
      , that bail to be on the same conditions as was determined by the Supreme Court on 28 November 2005 as amended. 
       
       
      JANKOWSKI: Your Honour just for the purposes of entering the bail, does the Court file disclose a previous bail undertaking which indicates those specific conditions imposed by the Supreme Court? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I don’t know the answer to that. Do you want to have a look at it? 
       
       
      JANKOWSKI: Yes if I may your Honour just so there are no problems in the office. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: All right and I’ll put the exhibits on the court file which includes MFI 1 because a number of items in that MFI were marked as exhibits. Thanks for your assistance with that Mr Jankowski and Ms Fleming and if you would convey my thanks to Mr Everson as well. I was assisted by both counsel in this matter. Mr McKenzie apparently needs to go upstairs to enter his bail. 
       
       
      JANKOWSKI: Yes your Honour I’ll take him up there. I was just wondering if I could have a look at the file just to double check. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes it’s coming to you.

    JUDGMENT1. In this matter Dr Webb, who appears for the accused Saleh Khodr, has indicated in advance that he proposes to lead evidence of his client's character. That evidence is not to be evidence of his client's good character generally but of his client's good character in two particular respects. The first is that he is not a violent person and the second is that he is an honest person. The Crown does not dispute that. 2. The Crown will not be challenging the assertion that Mr Saleh is not a violent person but does propose to challenge by leading evidence - tendered before me on the voir dire - that Mr Saleh is an honest person. 3. It is acknowledged that Mr Saleh has never been convicted of any offence involving dishonesty. Because of the ruling I propose to make I do not propose to go into the niceties about the nature of this application which was the subject of the High Court's judgment in TKWJ v The Queen (2002) 212 CLR 124. 4. The Crown Prosecutor in his submissions highlighted two items of the evidence tendered on voir dire upon which effectively the other evidence depended. Those two items were both witness statements. The first was by Mr Ameer Al Jebouri and was dated 29 May 2006. Mr Al Jebouri in that statement asserted that on Friday, 26 May 2006 two men came into his shop. He had seen them before. One of them said ""I come to you looking for Hussein"". Mr Al Jebouri: ""I know a lot of Hussein"". He said: ""Hussein Al Shemmari"". I said: ""I don't know, I know people by their first name not their family name"". The man then walked out of the store, spoke with somebody waiting outside and came back in with two other men whom Mr Al Jebouri had not seen before. The man came and showed him a photograph of someone whom Mr Al Jebouri knew as Hussein. He said: ""Yes, I know this guy"". The man said: ""Can I give you my number to give to Hussein because I want to fix everything. I don't want any problem. I want to fix everything with Hussein and my friend"". I said: ""Okay, I'll give you the number. Just tell him to ring me. We wanted to fix everything friendly, we don't want a problem. My friend don't want to go to the court"". The number was written out and the name of the man was written down. On Monday 29 May 2006 Mr Al Jebouri saw Hussein walking along Auburn road. He called out to him and asked him to come into the store. He handed him a piece of paper with the number on it and the man's name and reported what he had been told. Hussein left the store a short time later. 5. The second statement upon which the character evidence to be led by the Crown depends is a statement of Mr Hussein El Shemmari dated 26 February 2007. In the relevant portion of that statement Mr Al Shemmari says that in May or June 2006 he went into the restaurant where his friend Ali Al Zargani was working and Ali Al Zargani said:  
     
      
      ""Listen Saleh, he want to talk to you. He wanted to take your number because he have the court. He wanted to talk to you before he goes to the court. I said why not give him my number and I let him call me. Did you talk to him about the fight. He said yeah. He said I make mistake, my mistake. He said to us these people very bad. These people do something wrong. I didn't think about it I just came to fight"".  
       
      
    6. Mr Al Shemmari reports that Ali Al Zargani is a friend of his and he, Mr Al Shemmari, used to see Ali Al Zargani and Saleh Khodr, the accused in this case sitting at the front of the arcade as they were friends. About a day later Mr Al Shemmari reports that the accused, in this case Saleh Khodr, rang him and said: 
     
      
       "" 
      Look I want to see you now and I want to talk to you about the court"". Mr Al Shemmari reported: ""I will see you tomorrow"". Mr Khodr says: ""No it's too late tomorrow because court's tomorrow"". Mr Al Shemmari said: ""Okay, where do you want to see me""? Mr Khodr replied: ""Auburn, the coffee shop, El Amood"". Mr Al Shemmari: ""Okay, come there 
      "". 
       
        
      
    Mr Al Shemmari accordingly went to the shop and phoned the accused saying ""Where are you""? The accused said: ""Maybe I late, about 10 or 15 minutes"". Mr Al Shemmari said: ""Don't worry, I am going"". And he said that he did not report Saleh that day. 7. Based on the evidence which I have just referred to from both witnesses, the Crown's assertion is that that evidence demonstrates an attempt by the accused Mr Saleh Khodr to contact one of the witnesses for the prosecution in the trial against him and that that is inconsistent with an assertion of his honesty. 8. It is true that the evidence does certainly support the conclusion that Mr Saleh Khodr attempted to contact Mr Al Shemmari. However, as a matter of relevance I do not see anything of the evidence which suggests that such contact was inappropriate or improper. It was probably a questionable thing to do, perhaps even a foolish thing to do because the wrong conclusions could be drawn, but there was no discussion about the specific reason why Mr Khodr wanted to talk to Mr Al Shemmari about the court case. 9. In those circumstances I cannot see any submission which the Crown Prosecutor could make based upon that evidence which could affect an assertion by Mr Khodr that he is a person of good character in a particular respect, namely that he is honest. Accordingly I can indicate that if such evidence were tendered by the Crown as being relevant to an assertion of Mr Khodr's good character in that particular respect I will reject it as being not sufficiently relevant.

    JUDGMENTBackground1 On Tuesday the 13th June 2006 Johan Sieders and Somsri Yotchomchin appeared before me for trial, each of them upon one count of conducting a business involving the sexual servitude of other persons contrary to s.270.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The accused were separately represented.2 After some days dealing with a legal argument a jury was empanelled on the 19th June 2006, however on the 20th June 2006 it became necessary to discharge that jury when the first witness in the Crown case at the end of her examination-in-chief identified one of the jurors as a person with whom she was acquainted.3 On the 26th June 2006 a fresh jury was empanelled and the trial recommenced. On the 1st July 2006 the jury returned with verdicts of guilty in respect of each of the accused. 4 On the 13th July 2006 immediately following the close of the case for the Crown, counsel for the accused Yotchomchin rose to submit that his client had no case to answer in respect of the charge brought against her. He submitted that she could not be lawfully convicted of that offence, as the Crown had presented no evidence of the jurisdictional requirements mandated by s.270.5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code as it was when it is alleged that she committed the offence.5 Counsel for the accused Sieders, without adding anything to the argument, made an identical application in respect of his client relying upon the submissions made by counsel for Yotchomchin.6 The argument extended to the 14th July 2006, and after giving my consideration to the submissions made, I rejected both applications and indicated that I would publish my reasons in due course. The following are the reasons for rejecting the applications.The Crown Cases7 The accused Sieders was charged in the following terms: 
     
      
      Between about 1 December 2003 and 31 May 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, conducted a business, namely a brothel, that involved the sexual servitude of other persons, knowing about that sexual servitude, contrary to section 270.6(2) of the  
      Criminal Code 
       1995 (Cth). 
      
    8 The accused Yotchomchin was charged in the following terms: 
     
      
       
      Between about 1 December 2003 and 31 May 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, conducted a business, namely brothels, that involved the sexual servitude of other persons, knowing about that sexual servitude, contrary to section 270.6(2) of the  
      Criminal Code  
      1995 (Cth). 
      
    9 The accused were not charged as participants in the same offence, but with separate offences arising from alleged conduct and circumstances of an identical nature. 10 The evidence from the witnesses called was relevant to both trials. They included young Thai women employed as prostitutes in the brothels operated by the accused within the same period of time. It was therefore appropriate for these trials to be conducted together and at the same time. There was no application in any event by either of the accused for their trials to be conducted separately.11 In each case the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that: 
     
      
      (a) The accused conducted their business; 
       
       
      (b) The business involved the sexual servitude of other persons; and 
       
       
      (c) The accused know of that sexual servitude. 
      
    12 The first and second of these elements are what the Criminal Code refers to as physical elements, and the third is what the Code describes as a fault element. 13 The Crown case broadly stated was that these accused operated brothels in which Thai girls, in circumstances of sexual servitude, were engaged to provide sexual services to clients of those brothels until they had generated income sufficient to discharge in each case a debt of approximately $45,000, comprising $15,000 for arrangements made in Thailand for their travel to Australia with a tourist visa, and a further $30,000 in Australia for the opportunity to remain and work here. The applications for the tourist visas, and subsequent visas sought when the women were in Australia, were made upon false representations.14 The arrangements in Thailand were set in place by a woman known as Pat with whom the accused Yotchomchin was associated. 15 The Crown alleged that the women were not free to cease providing sexual services because of the threat of detrimental action against themselves and their families in Thailand should they not earn the funds needed to discharge the debt of $45,000 imposed upon them, and the fear of deportation to the impoverished circumstances from which they had escaped if they had tried to do so.The Relevant Provisions16 The terms sexual servitude and threat are defined. S.270.4 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code provides in sub-section (1): 
     
      
      For the purposes of this division,  
      sexual servitude 
       is the condition of a person who provides sexual services and who, because of the use of force or threats: 
       
       
      (a) Is not free to cease providing sexual services; or 
       
       
      (b Is not free to leave the place or area where the person provides the sexual services. 
      
    17 Subsection (2) of this section provides: 
     
      
      In this section: 
       
       
      threat  
      means  
       
       
      (a) a threat of force; or 
       
       
      (b) a threat to cause a person’s deportation; or 
       
       
      (c) a threat of any other detrimental action unless there are reasonable grounds for the threat of that action in connection with a provision of sexual services by a person.  
      
    18 Sexual service is defined in the Dictionary to the Commonwealth Criminal Code in the following terms: 
     
      
      Means the commercial use or display of the body of the person providing the service for the sexual gratification others. 
      
    19 It is common ground that s.270.5 of the Criminal Code, as it stood until its repeal and replacement by the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Act, 2005 (Cth), applies to these matters. Counsel for the accused brought to my attention Esber v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another (1991-1992) 174 CLR 431 in support of this proposition, which in any event the Crown conceded in the course of the argument. This section provides, 
     
      
      A person commits an offence against section 270.6 or 270.7 only if: 
       
       
      (a) all of the following subparagraphs apply: 
       
       
        
        (i) the person is an Australian citizen, a resident of Australia, a body corporate incorporated by or under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory or any other body corporate that carries on its activity principally in Australia; and 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the conduct constituting the offence is engaged in outside Australia; and 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) the sexual services to which the alleged offence relates are provided or to be provided, outside Australia; or 
        
       
       
      (b) both: 
       
       
        
        (i) the conduct constituting the alleged offence is to any extent engaged in outside Australia; and 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the sexual services to which the alleged offence relates are to any extent provided, or to be provided, within Australia; or 
        
       
       
      (c) both: 
       
       
        
        (i) the conduct constituting the alleged offence is to any extent engaged in or within Australia; and 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the sexual services to which the alleged offence relates are to any extent provided, or to be provided, outside Australia. 
        
       
      
    The Submissions 20 Counsel for the accused submitted that s.270.5 of the Criminal Code, as it was when it is alleged that the offences were committed, did not provide jurisdiction to the Commonwealth for the prosecution of these offences, for none of the paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) could apply to the facts and circumstances upon which the Crown relies to establish its case. 21 The charges, as framed, allege that the accused conducted businesses in Sydney, but should have also alleged conduct outside of Australia to address the jurisdictional requirements that these paragraphs, expressed in the alternative, demand. 22 Counsel submitted that there was no evidence of any extra-territorial conduct on the part of the accused, or the Thai women in respect of whom these prosecutions are brought, upon which the Crown could rely in any event. 23 Counsel pointed to the words ""cease providing"" used in the definition of sexual servitude in s.270.4 of the Criminal Code, and submitted that properly construed, they required that the provision of sexual services by the person or persons in sexual servitude must be contemporaneous with the conduct alleged of the accused.24 There was no evidence of threatening conduct by the accused outside of Australia to keep the women to the task of providing sexual services within Australia.25 The conduct alleged of the accused and the sexual services provided all took place within Australia; the sexual services were only ever provided in Australia. The minimum jurisdictional requirement is that the sexual services should have commenced overseas and then continued in Australia, and, in circumstances in which the women concerned were not free to cease providing the sexual services in Australia. 26 It was submitted that the evidence adduced by the Crown is capable of establishing only that the women came to Australia and then commenced to work in the sex industry, that there was no continuation of the provision of sexual services from outside Australia to within, and that this continuum was necessary for there to be the jurisdiction claimed by the Commonwealth.27 Without wishing to do injustice to the submissions of counsel, the points ventured might be conveniently summarised in the following way: 
     
      
      (1) The provisions under consideration, being a part of a criminal statute, should be construed narrowly; 
       
       
      (2) Upon the proper construction of the phrase ""cease providing"" used in the definition of sexual servitude, the provision of sexual services needed to be contemporaneous with the alleged misconduct of the accused; I understood this submission to be that the use of force or threats required for the condition of sexual servitude had to be contemporaneous with the provision of sexual services; that the force, or the threats, were to be contemporaneous with the provision of sexual services, and not before or after the time when they were being provided; and that the application of force or threats must be the conduct of the accused, and not of others associated with the accused and concerned in the arrangements for the deployment of these women in Australia from Thailand; 
       
       
      (3) S.270.5 of the  
      Criminal Code 
       imposes a jurisdictional limitation confining the Commonwealth to the prosecution of offences, such as are charged against these accused, to facts and circumstances to which one or other of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of s.270.5 may be applied; 
       
       
      (4) Each of these paragraphs require that the relevant facts and circumstances have extra-territorial characteristics before there has been such an offence committed; 
       
       
      (5) Paragraph (a) provides for Australian citizens, residents, or bodies corporate incorporated in the Commonwealth, the States or Territories, or carrying on activities principally in Australia, and, requires that the conduct said to constitute the offence, and the sexual services alleged, to have been outside of Australia; 
       
       
      (6) Alternatively, paragraph (b) provides for conduct constituting the alleged offence to any extent engaged in outside Australia, and, sexual services to which the alleged offence relates to any extent provided or to be provided within Australia; 
       
       
      (7) In the further alternative, paragraph (c) provides for conduct constituting the alleged offence to any extent engaged in within Australia, and, sexual services to which the alleged offence relates to any extent provided or to be provided outside Australia; 
       
       
      (8) The conduct alleged of the accused, and their enterprises, have no extra-territorial characteristics whatsoever; and 
       
       
      (9) The sexual services provided by the nominated Thai women were in each case provided entirely within Australia; 
       
       
      (10) Accordingly, the facts and circumstances upon which the Crown relies to establish its case do not answer any of the requirements of this provision, and accordingly no offence has been committed. 
       
      
    28 I was not referred to any authority in the course of the submissions.29 In response, the Crown reminded me of the physical elements of the offence, namely, that the accused conducted their businesses, and, that those businesses involved the sexual servitude of other persons. 30 The Crown pointed out that the physical element of an offence may be conduct, or a result of conduct, or, a circumstance in which conduct or a result of conduct occurs: section 4.1(1) of the Criminal Code. 31 Conduct is defined at section 4.1(2) of the Code to mean an act, an omission to perform an act, or a state of affairs.32 The Crown submitted that the conduct constituting the offences alleged against the accused includes the state of affairs in which the women from Thailand, whilst in their homeland, became indebted to others who, in due course, were to be paid the amounts claimed from the money harvested by Yotchomchin and Sieders from the sexual services provided by the women in Australia. The payments were to be made, and the evidence was that they were made, by way of the transfer of funds from Australia to Thailand from the cash flow generated by the women, after they arrived in Australia and began providing sexual services. 33 The Crown submitted that the arguments advanced on behalf of the accused failed to understand the true nature of the physical elements of these offences. 34 The accused conducted their businesses as brothels, involving the sexual servitude of the Thai women from whom the court has heard. This sexual servitude was a state of affairs, which, by definition, is conduct for the purposes of the Criminal Code. The state of affairs arose in Thailand from whence the women came to Australia after having fallen under the management and control of those who arranged for and facilitated their travel to Australia upon tourist visas obtained in response to false representations.35 The Crown submitted that the events and circumstances that are alleged to have brought about the condition of sexual servitude in the four women, nominated as being in that condition, occurred in Thailand and Australia. The circumstances which brought about the condition of sexual servitude had their origin in Thailand, and then continued to evolve thereafter as the women were brought to Australia under the arrangement which had as its goal their deployment in these brothels to provide sexual services for the financial benefit of the accused, and to a lesser extent their associates in Thailand.36 The jurisdictional requirements of section 270.5(b) of the Code are fulfilled if the conduct constituting the alleged offence is to any extent engaged in outside Australia, and, the sexual services to which the alleged offence relates are to any extent provided, or to be provided, within Australia.37 The Crown submitted that paragraph (b) of s.270.5 is therefore satisfied.Conclusion38 I agree with the submissions made by the Crown. 39 The question is to be determined upon the proper construction of the relevant provisions. S. 270.5 (b) provides (emphasis added), 
     
      
      A person co 
      mmits an offence against section 270.6 … only if: both the 
        
      conduct 
       constituting the alleged offence is  
      to any extent 
       engaged in outside Australia; and the sexual services to which the alleged offence relates are to any extent provided, or to be provided, within Australia;… 
      
    40 Clearly there is evidence that sexual services were provided by the four nominated Thai women within Australia, and accordingly that aspect of this paragraph is satisfied.41 There are I believe two ways to approach the first aspect of paragraph (b) of the section.42 First, the definition of the term conduct provided in the Code is expressed to mean, amongst other things, a state of affairs. 43 The state of affairs upon which the Crown may rely is the sexual servitude in which it is alleged that each of these women existed. This state of affairs in each case had its genesis in Thailand when the women made their connection with the woman Pat, with whom, according to the evidence, Yotchomchin was associated for the purposes of the arrangements to bring them from Thailand to Australia as sex workers upon visas obtained fraudulently. The state of affairs in each case therefore continued to evolve through a process from when the particular girl first began her association with the woman Pat.44 In the circumstances, it must be said that this ""conduct"", that is to say the state of affairs of sexual servitude, was at least to some extent engaged in outside Australia.45 Secondly, the second physical element of the offence, that the business involved the sexual servitude of other persons, is an element that may be properly described as a circumstance in which the conduct of the businesses occurred: s. 4.1(1)(c) Criminal Code.46 What I have said with regard to the state of affairs of sexual servitude applies with equal force to the circumstance of sexual servitude contemplated in the second element of the charges.47 I do not accept the submission of counsel for the accused that the phrase ""cease providing"" used in the definition of sexual servitude requires that the provision of sexual services be contemporaneous with the alleged misconduct of the accused in the way that he has ventured, according to my understanding of the submissions. What is required, relevantly, is that the effect of the threats required for the condition of sexual servitude be contemporaneous with the provision of sexual services, whether those threats were made contemporaneously or at some time before the provision of sexual services. In other words, it is the existence of the threat and its continuing effect upon the women that is to be established.48 Neither do I accept that the threats must be from the accused. It is sufficient if there is evidence of the effect of the threats impacting upon the women said to have been in sexual servitude, of which the accused are shown to have the requisite knowledge, notwithstanding that the threats might have emanated from sources other than the accused, and at some earlier time. 49 The Crown is entitled to advance upon the evidence it has presented of the events and circumstances under which these women became a part of these arrangements commencing in Thailand, as evidence of sexual servitude that commenced there, and continued thereafter as the women were brought to Australia to be deployed as prostitutes in this country.50 For these reasons I came to the view that the applications made on behalf if the accused that there be directed verdicts should be rejected.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SANTOW JA:  
     
      
      INTRODUCTION  
       
      This appeal arises from a two-car motor vehicle collision occurring at an intersection of a busy four-lane highway in a rural area of New South Wales. The appellant, Mr Royal, collided with the first respondent, Mr Smurthwaite’s car. Immediately before, Mr Smurthwaite, having first stopped at the stop sign at Bago Road, proceeded to drive across the Pacific Highway in a south-easterly direction at the area designated for such a crossing. Mr Royal was proceeding northwards along that highway, his cruise control set at 105 kph, when the collision occurred.  
       
      
    2 There is an issue on appeal as to whether the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales (“RTA”) should have been held liable as a joint tortfeasor, by reason of what the appellant contends was the negligent design of the crossing.  
     
      
    3 Phelan DCJ, the trial judge, concluded that the appellant was two-thirds liable in negligence for the serious injuries suffered by Mr Smurthwaite, whilst Mr Smurthwaite was held to be contributorily negligent to the extent of one-third. It is only Mr Royal who now challenges that apportionment though not that he was negligent, seeking to substitute 20:80 apportionment.  
     
      
    4 However, Mr Royal, in relation to his appeal from the dismissal of his cross-claim against the RTA, challenges the finding by the trial judge that the RTA, the second respondent, was not liable at all as a joint tortfeasor. Mr Royal seeks to substitute an order that the RTA contribute to Mr Royal 80% of the amount ordered to be paid by Mr Royal to Mr Smurthwaite, together with 80% of the costs of Mr Smurthwaite ordered to be paid by Mr Royal with respect to the trial.  
     
      
    5 As Basten JA puts it, whose judgment I have had the advantage of reading in draft, the overall effect of the appellant’s challenge to the assessment of contributory negligence and to the RTA’s liability would be, if successful “to reduce his liability to 4%, by claiming that the plaintiff should bear 80% of the responsibility for the accident and that the RTA should contribute 80% of his (the defendant’s) proportion”.  
     
      
    6 Much of the argument on appeal concerned the second matter of liability, namely, whether the RTA should be required to contribute the 80% above mentioned, as having been negligent in the design of the crossing.  
     
      
    7 Mr Royal’s appeal against Mr Smurthwaite also extended to damages. The trial judge assessed damage at just over $1.3 million. The judgment in favour of Mr Smurthwaite, after allowing for one-third contributory negligence, became $871,019.50. The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in allowing past out-of-pocket expenses in the amount of $13,902.63, being the costs of a relative visiting the first respondent in hospital, contending that such allowance was prohibited by Chapter 5 and in particular s83 of the Motor Accident Compensation Act, 1999 (NSW) (“MACA”).  
     
      
    8 Mr Royal also contends that the trial judge erred in  
     
      
      (a) allowing the wrong amount for economic loss, by basing it not on his actual earnings but on higher “comparable earnings” of tree-fallers employed by the company which took over his employer and who would thus have probably employed him but for his injury, so producing an amount “ 
      which was manifestly excessive in the circumstances 
      ”; and  
      (b) in ordering Mr Royal to pay to Mr Smurthwaite the costs which Mr Smurthwaite was required to pay to the RTA with respect to the trial, such having been ordered by way of Bullock Order. SALIENT FACTS  
      
    9 The following outline of the events that happened is essentially undisputed, save where indicated in [14] below.  
     
      
    10 The first respondent was injured on 12 March 2001 in a motor vehicle accident at Herons Creek, a rural area of New South Wales. The first respondent was driving his motor vehicle in an easterly direction across the Pacific Highway from a position guarded by a stop sign at the intersection of Bago Road and the Pacific Highway. There was a “dip” on the Pacific Highway about 210 to 300 metres south of the intersection. The appellant was driving his motor vehicle north on the Pacific Highway. The vehicles collided at the RTA designed and constructed intersection crossing Pacific Highway. The first respondent suffered serious injury as a result of the collision.  
     
      
    11 As north-bound Pacific Highway traffic approached the intersection there were two principal lanes of travel. There was also provision for two south-bound lanes of traffic on the Pacific Highway with the north-and-south-bound traffic separated by a distance of about 250 metres. About 50-100 metres before the intersection a left-hand turn lane commenced to allow north-bound traffic to turn left into Bago Road. About 210 metres south of the intersection and 115 metres south of the point of impact, a right-hand turn lane commenced to allow north-bound traffic to turn right into Boyds Road (see figure 2 at page 10 of the report of Roger Stuart-Smith dated 11 April, 2003 at Blue, 737 and the parties’ annotated diagram of the motor vehicle accident added to Blue, 328). Boyds Road was directly opposite Bago Road, joining the north-bound and south-bound carriageways. The impact occurred in the right-hand turn lane near to the mouth of Boyds Road; the point of impact is shown on Blue, 328 (hatched orange).  
     
      
    12 The second respondent RTA had the care, control and management of the roadway upon which the motor vehicle accident occurred. The second respondent had also redesigned the relevant intersection, the construction of the redesigned intersection being completed in about 1993 (Red, 32P). After this accident, some further, but not major adjustments were made to move the “stop” sign a little closer to Boyds Road to improve the vision from that sign of on-coming north-bound traffic.  
     
      
    13 Both drivers, Mr Royal and Mr Smurthwaite, were familiar with the road and intersection. Mr Smurthwaite in his vehicle first stopped at the stop sign before crossing, the stop sign being some 21 metres before the point of impact and at the crest of the hill at the intersection of the Highway with Bago Road. There appear to have been four vehicles on the highway in the vicinity of the intersection when Mr Smurthwaite arrived at it.  
     
      
    14 Mr Smurthwaite then set about crossing the through lanes of the Pacific Highway from Bago Road (intending to enter Boyds Road on the opposite side of the Highway). Visibility was good from the stop sign at Bago Road. However it was possible that certain highway traffic could obscure traffic in the other lanes, given the dip referred to in [10] above. Mr Royal was travelling north on the Highway. There were two north-bound lanes and a turning lane left into Bago Road approached via a long sweeping curve in the road and a right-hand turning lane into Boyds Road. The appellant was driving using cruise control set at 105 kph. There is a dispute as to whether Mr Royal just prior to the collision had been “cutting the corner” by driving into the right-hand turning lane (as the two other drivers Relf and Hubbard suggested), or whether he had swerved to avoid Mr Smurthwaite and then braked. Mr Royal collided head-on with the side of Mr Smurthwaite’s vehicle, towards the rear door.  
     
      
    15 Mr Smurthwaite suffered serious injuries, including a profound head injury and major injuries to his right side, and hip, which required repeated surgery. He has restricted mobility and continuing pain in his hip and knee. He had, before the accident, worked as a tree-faller in the forestry industry nearby.  
     
      
    16 Mr Smurthwaite could give no explanation of why he proceeded in front of oncoming traffic from the stop sign in Bago Road. However, he had no recollection of the accident because of the injuries he suffered (Red, 56K). The trial judge speculated that Mr Smurthwaite might have assumed that Mr Royal, in merging into the right turn lane, would have to slow down significantly before he could turn right (Red, 57O), though also observing that this “scenario still posed … a risk of collision”.  
     
      
    17 Senior Constable Bentley was the crash investigator for the incident. His photos are Exhibit 6 at Blue, 1220. These identify the appellant’s skid marks one of which commenced some 25 metres before the point of impact and the other of which commenced 16 metres before that point.  
     
      
       
      The primary judgment  
      
    18 There were two other drivers who gave evidence of what they witnessed. Mr Relf was a driver travelling behind Mr Royal along the Pacific Highway. Mr Hubbard was travelling behind Mr Smurthwaite.  
     
      
    19 The trial judge accepted Mr Relf’s evidence as to Mr Royal’s speed and driving behaviour (Red, 48K). He also accepted Mr Hubbard’s account (which was consistent with Mr Relf, essentially to the effect that the appellant had been cutting the corner and braked too late to avoid the collision), noting that it accorded with all experts save for Mr Griffiths.  
     
      
    20 The expert evidence from Mr Hennessy (expert for Mr Smurthwaite), including his analysis of the skid marks on the road, confirmed the views of Mr Relf and Mr Hubbard as to the relevant events (Red, 55H). Only the expert, Mr Griffiths, (for the appellant) supported the appellant’s version of events (Red, 55J). The other experts were Mr Keirnan (for the second respondent) and Mr Stewart-Smith (for the appellant) and Mr Johnson (for the first respondent).  
     
      
    21 The trial judge found that the overwhelming evidence was that the appellant was the primary cause of the accident (Red, 55P). The respondent was held to be contributorily negligent to the extent of one-third (Red, 585).  
     
      
    22 The appellant was described by the trial judge as having repeatedly contradicted himself as to when he had first seen the first respondent, which lane he was in and how he had reacted (Red, 55Q). The key variations in the accounts went to whether the appellant had been “cutting the corner” by driving in the right-hand turning lane (as Mr Hubbard and Mr Relf suggested), whether he had swerved into that lane to avoid the first respondent, and when he had first braked.  
     
      
    23 Given these contradictions, the trial judge considered he could place almost no reliance on the appellant’s evidence (Red, 55S).  
     
      
    24 The trial judge held that the appellant could have avoided the accident in a number of different ways; in particular he should have deactivated cruise control earlier and applied his brakes (Red, 56C). The appellant also could have either gone behind or in front of the first respondent’s car (as suggested by Mr Relf, the driver travelling behind the appellant along the Highway) (Red, 56F).  
     
      
    25 The trial judge observed that it was consistent with the evidence of Mr Hubbard that when the first respondent took off from his stationary position the appellant’s car had not come into sight but was about to (Red, 56W). It may have been the case that there was nothing in his vision when the first respondent entered the intersection (Red, 57G).  
     
      
    26 The trial judge found that although the intersection was a known “black-spot” with a number of serious accidents including some fatalities and although the RTA had taken some (limited) steps to deal with the problem (Red, 58N), there was no negligence on its part which was causative of the accident (Red, 59H).  
     
      
    27 Significant issues as to damages were agreed between the parties (Red, 63 H). The trial judge accepted that the first respondent suffered from ongoing depression and required considerable ongoing nursing, as described by his wife (Red, 62H, P).  
     
      
    28 The trial judge made the following awards: · $280,000 damages (out of a maximum of $341,000) reflecting pain and suffering and reduced enjoyment of life (Red, 63K) (not challenged); · past economic loss for 172 weeks from 12 March 2001 as per Red, 63Q-Y; this is challenged as is future economic loss on the ground that the trial judge erred in wrongly allowing an increased amount for compensable earnings, based on the evidence of a Mrs Hoffman (who had acquired the tree falling business Bartletts which had, pre his accident, employed the first respondent); · domestic assistance for 195 weeks at 21 hours per week and continuing in the future at 21 hours per week (see Red, 64K) (not challenged); · past out of pocket expenses of $13,902.63 (Red, 64T) (challenged on the basis that these were wrongly allowed for amounts expended by a relation visiting and attending upon the first respondent when in hospital, on the basis that such an award was prohibited by Ch 5 and s83 of the MACA).  
     
      
    29 In dismissing the case against the RTA, the trial judge gave very limited reasons which I quote in full below:  
     
      
       
        
        “There remains the case against the second defendant. The evidence I think clearly establishes that this part of the roadway was seen by the RTA as a ‘black spot’. There had been a number of serious accidents, including some fatalities, over the period of time that the highway had been upgraded.  
         
         
        The RTA had taken steps from time to time to deal with the problem and the chief problem seem to have been the one that was demonstrated in Mr Griffith’s report and that is the difficulty of somebody stopped facing east at the Bago intersection being in a position of not being aware of traffic behind other cars proceeding north, particularly in the left-hand lane.  
         
         
        It is noteworthy that following the changes to which I made reference earlier there is said to have been fewer incidents of serious accidents at the intersection, that is by broadening the exit road for westbound traffic and bringing the median strip and the stop sign and line closer to the intersection.  
         
         
        Whilst I conclude that in a number of respects more could have been done by the RTA to improve this intersection, in the end result I am not satisfied that the accident represented a failure by the RTA in the circumstances of this case and thus there will be a verdict for the second defendant.”  
        
       
      
    30 To that brief statement of reasons I should refer briefly to the judgment on costs handed down 1 May 2006. Mr Harben, SC for the appellant submitted that this judgment, being in respect of costs only and following the judgment on liability, could not properly be resorted to as additional reasons with respect to denying RTA’s potential liability. I agree with that submission. In dealing with the case against the RTA I have not taken that part of the costs judgment into account.  
     
      
    31 The trial judge awarded costs in favour of the first respondent and in addition made a Bullock Order in favour of the first respondent against the appellant in respect of the costs of the RTA which is also the subject of the appellant’s appeal.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal  
      
    32 As to the first respondent’s claim against the appellant:  
     
      
      (1) The trial judge erred in not finding that the first respondent was the principal cause of the subject motor vehicle accident.  
      (2) The trial judge erred in finding that despite the first respondent entering onto a divided highway into the path of high-speed traffic including the appellant that he was only one third to blame for the subject motor vehicle accident.  
      (3) The trial judge erred in wrongly concluding that the expert Mr Griffiths was the “lone piper” with regard to the interpretation of skid marks on the highway and their significance and ignored the evidence given by other witnesses including the experts in the case.  
      (4) The trial judge erred in relying on the statements of witnesses Mr Rolf and Mr Hubbard which had been admitted for a limited purpose only and the trial judge failed to address in any way the difference between those statements and the witnesses’ oral evidence.  
      (5) The trial judge erred in allowing past out of pocket expenses in the amount of $13,902.63 (being the costs of a relative visiting the first respondent in hospital) which were prohibited by s83, MACA.  
      (6) The trial judge erred in allowing the wrong amount for comparable earnings in his calculation for past and future economic loss which produced an amount which was manifestly excessive in the circumstances.  
      (7) The trial judge erred in ordering the appellant to pay to the first respondent those costs which the first respondent was required to pay to the second respondent with respect to the trial.  
      
    33 As to the appellant’s cross-claim against the second respondent the trial judge erred in failing to find the second respondent liable:  
     
      
      (1) The trial judge failed to find that when the second respondent redesigned the subject intersection as a cross-intersection to enable traffic (including the first respondent) to directly cross the highway, that this made it foreseeably dangerous.  
      (2) The trial judge failed to find that the second respondent knew that such an intersection was dangerous and failed to act to remedy it.  
      (3) The trial judge failed to find that in view of the configuration of the subject intersection the second respondent should have redesigned the intersection to prevent persons such as the first respondent from attempting to directly cross the highway in the path of oncoming high speed traffic.  
      (4) The trial judge failed to find that the physical layout of the intersection designed and maintained by the second respondent led the first respondent and/or the appellant to misjudge their situations and caused or contributed to the subject collision.  
      
    34 Further, the trial judge erred in failing to give adequate reasons for dismissing the appellant’s cross claim against the first respondent.  
     
      
    35 In summary, the appellant also challenges the addition of $13,902.63 awarded for out of pocket expenses, seeks reduced earnings figures for the calculation of economic loss (with superannuation reduced accordingly), seeks a reassessment of contributory negligence by increasing it to 80%, seeks to render the RTA a joint tortfeasor to 80% and seeks modified costs orders.  
     
      
       
      DISPOSITION  
       
      Appellant’s appeal relating to contributory negligence  
      
    36 I consider that the principal issue in this appeal is not whether there is any basis for reapportioning liability as between Mr Royal and Mr Smurthwaite from the two-thirds/one-third determined by the trial judge. There is as I will explain, no basis for doing so as the evidence clearly enough reveals. I refer here first to the admissions of Mr Royal under cross-examination carefully recorded by the trial judge. These, coupled with the evidence of Mr Relf and Mr Hubbard, leave no basis for reapportionment in terms of the causal potency of the contributions of each of Messrs Royal and Smurthwaite to the accident. But in so concluding, I put to one side the RTA. It must be remembered that Mr Smurthwaite does not seek to challenge the attribution to him of one-third responsibility in contributory negligence. It is the appellant that seeks to do so, by increasing it to 80%. But because the appellant concentrates much of his attack upon the exoneration of the RTA from any causal responsibility for the accident, that issue must be squarely faced. However, before doing so, I need to consider more closely the role of Mr Royal in the accident.  
     
      
    37 I do so, bearing in mind the deference required to findings on apportionment (see, for example, Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (1985) 59 ALR 529) though a lesser deference is required to a finding of contributory negligence (Ghunaim v Bart [2004] NSWCA 28). The only real basis put forward by Mr Royal as appellant for disturbing the apportionment against him was his reliance on the submission that the maximum available time for him to act or react was only 2.8 to 3.5 seconds. Mr Royal relies on this to mitigate if not remove any criticism of his driving behaviour.  
     
      
    38 That submission was based upon Senior Constable Bentley timing vehicles crossing the intersection and obtaining a range of 2.8 to 3.5 seconds. The expert Mr Griffiths similarly timed the vehicles crossing the intersection and obtained a range of 3.0 to 3.5 seconds. From this, Mr Royal argues that with Mr Smurthwaite’s vehicle travelling much slower than his, the opportunity and ability to either stop, slow or swerve available to Mr Smurthwaite was much greater than to him. The appellant complains that the trial judge “did not seem to address that in his judgment either but simply concluded, on the basis of the Appellant’s inconsistencies in his evidence, his insistence of his right of way and his failure to de-activate cruise control earlier (within the time frame) that this driving behaviour meant that he was largely responsible for the accident”. It is said that “this with respect ignores the grossly negligent behaviour of the First Respondent which was the immediate source of the potential collision” (Orange, 26).  
     
      
    39 Based upon this time dimension, the appellant then seeks to refute the trial judge’s conclusions set out below, namely that the appellant:  
     
      
      (a) should have deactivated cruise control long before he did;  
      (b) should have applied the brakes;  
      (c) could have gone round behind Mr Smurthwaite; and  
      (d) could probably have gone round in front of Mr Smurthwaite if he had continued on.  
      
    40 The conclusion, quoted below, then introduces the RTA as the source of “the real culprit”, being “the road geometry”, though interestingly the focus seems to be on Mr Smurthwaite being misled by the road geometry; that hardly exculpates Mr Royal. No doubt this reflected the appellant’s forensic dilemma. Challenging the appellant’s responsibility at all suggested inconsistency. For how then could the appellant establish in the alternative a shared liability or responsibility between himself on the one hand and the RTA on the other?  
     
      
    41 I set out the relevant part of the submission below:  
     
      
       
        
        “The real culprit is the road geometry. The intersection being at a crest or gradient, with approaching highway traffic rounding a curve and also travelling through a dip, meant that the intersection's physical layout created a real potential for misjudgement to occur. Misjudgement is consistent with and explanatory of the First Respondent being an experienced driver but making the gross elementary mistake of driving across the face of high speed oncoming traffic. Causatively, some deception must have been in play and the road geometry is the culprit.”  
        
       
      
    42 The appellant’s challenge has to somehow overcome the concessions in cross-examination elicited from Mr Royal and the findings which result from those concessions. The appellant attempted to do so by hypothesising the timeframe limited to 2.8 to 3.5 seconds to which I have referred. The fundamental problem for the appellant is two-fold. First the findings against him were based upon what he conceded in cross-examination. Second, the timeframe was never reliably established to be no more than 3.5 seconds.  
     
      
    43 I shall start with the concessions made by Mr Royal after a lengthy cross-examination, parts of which are quoted by the trial judge; Red, 37-47. That cross-examination concedes that “had you not insisted upon your right of way and had you accepted that cruise control ought to be deactivated you could simply have pulled up before you got to the intersection” (Black T, 355N-P). That concession was preceded by Mr Royal accepting that doing the best he could, he saw Mr Smurthwaite’s vehicle move off (from the stop sign) when Mr Royal was about 150 metres back from the intersection (Black T, 355J-M).  
     
      
    44 He then concedes that he was at the critical time in the right-hand turn lane (Black T, 356I-J), being the turning lane for turning right into Boyds Road. That was in breach of the road rules since his intention was to cut the corner trying to straighten the curve in the road. This Mr Relf’s evidence confirmed, based upon his observation from his car just behind Mr Royal; Red, 50T and Mr Relf’s examination in chief Black T, 100U-Y, 101X-102V and 102Q-T (“I’d describe it as straightening the road, like I mean there’s bends in the road and to straighten the road out”). Mr Royal was all the time maintaining his speed at around 105 to 110 kph in an area where the speed limit was 100 kph and the recommended speed given the presence of the dangerous intersection was 80 kph. Mr Relf was some three to four seconds behind Mr Royal and had a clear view of him (Black T, 102C-E). Mr Relf estimated Mr Royal’s speed at around 110 kph; Red, 49M. As the trial judge observes, Mr Royal conceded he knew that to use the right-hand turn lane as if he was going to travel straight ahead was something he was not entitled to do (Red, 47L-N).  
     
      
    45 The earlier stated concession bore out his capacity to have pulled up before he arrived at the intersection and thus to have obviated the collision. This, coupled with his insistence on maintaining cruise control for fuel economy and insisting on his right-of-way, were at odds with any inference one might draw that the time available to him to avoid the accident precluded the very thing that he considered he could have done, namely pulling up before the intersection and before the collision.  
     
      
    46 But in any event, as the written submissions of the first respondent demonstrate, there was evidence in support of a longer period than 2.8 to 3.5 seconds to take avoidance action. Although there was some dispute about the expert Mr Johnson’s calculation of 4.6 seconds, based on the acceleration factor assumed by him, there was also evidence of the other driver Mr Hubbard who had observed Mr Smurthwaite and Mr Royal. Mr Hubbard, from his vehicle behind Mr Smurthwaite, gave evidence that Mr Royal travelled virtually the full length of the right-hand turning lane in the time it took Mr Smurthwaite to cross to where he was hit (Black T, 132D-F). Given that (i) the right-hand turning lane was some 180-200 metres in length, and (ii) Mr Royal was travelling at approximately 29 metres per second, this would result in a longer time of some 5 to 6.5 seconds.  
     
      
    47 Indeed Mr Royal agreed in cross-examination that if he assumed, as would be the case, that at 105 kph he would take 6.8 seconds to travel 200 metres at the time Mr Smurthwaite moved off it would have taken about 4.6 seconds “may be a little more” for him to reach the point of impact (Black T, 346U-W). The 200 metres was derived from the fact that approximately 200 metres south of the intersection the roadway widened to form the dedicated turn bay for right-turning traffic and 150 metres for the left-turning traffic. Mr Royal conceded that he overtook some vehicles some distance short of that left-turning point using up around 50 metres (Black T, 345U-346S). The upshot of that evidence was that he conceded that he was about 150 metres back from the intersection when he first saw Mr Smurthwaite’s vehicle (Black T, 355J-M).  
     
      
    48 The result is that there was evidence available to permit an inference that the appellant had 4.6 to 6.5 seconds to take action to avoid the collision, this being as the first respondent points out, implicit in the trial judge’s reasons that he accepted that period of time.  
     
      
    49 This combination of Mr Royal’s concessions and Mr Relf’s evidence, accepted as reliable, from his observations of Mr Royal, made inevitable a finding that Mr Royal was primarily at fault for the accident.  
     
      
    50 Then there was the evidence from Mr Hubbard, also described by the trial judge as a careful and accurate witness and one, moreover, familiar with the area. He was able to add his observations of Mr Smurthwaite from his position behind Mr Smurthwaite coming to the stop sign in Bago Road. He observed the following:  
     
      
      (a) As he was approaching the intersection he saw a green station-wagon (Mr Smurthwaite’s) stopped at the stop sign waiting to cross the Highway (Black T, 119R-S);  
      (b) Just after he could first see Mr Smurthwaite’s green station-wagon starting to move off (Black, T, 119T-U), he observed what he described as a “second white car”, identified as Mr Royal’s, in the right-hand turning lane (Black T, 120U-W);  
      (c) He then noticed the vehicle described as “a white vehicle”, being Mr Royal’s, “braking” and “the bonnet dipped under brakes”, which “then … locked up” (Black T, 121H-K);  
      (d) He observed the bonnet “dipped under brakes and it virtually immediately locked up and skidded virtually in a straight line and hit the green station-wagon” (Black T, 121P-R);  
      (e) That vehicle (Mr Royal’s) was not observed at any time to swerve or move to the left or right (Black T, 121R-T);  
      
    51 Against this, it was admitted that the trial judge quoted from Mr Hubbard’s statement (Red, 53V-54S), in circumstances where the statement was only admitted on a limited basis, namely insofar as it coincided with evidence given in court (Black T, 475H-476E). However, it will be apparent that, as in the case of Mr Relf, that Mr Hubbard’s oral evidence in court did coincide in the relevant respects with the parts of the statement relied upon against the appellant.  
     
      
    52 Mr Relf’s evidence on the absence of swerve or steer by Mr Royal’s car so far as relied upon by the trial judge (Red, 51L-Q, 51P, 51X and 52E), was first described in the statement of Mr Relf. But then it was elaborated in both his evidence in chief and in cross-examination (see in particular Black T, 104R). It was not disputed that Mr Relf was three to four seconds behind Mr Royal. Insofar as the trial judge at Red, 52M-53K gave a further synthesis of what was said by Mr Relf, this was not relevantly material since it dealt with what happened after the collision. Moreover there was independent evidence supporting Mr Relf’s opinion that the intersection was “bad” while Mr Royal asserted that the intersection was “dangerous”. Moreover Constable Bentley gave evidence to the effect that there was ample opportunity to cross the Highway from west to east if one observed the traffic properly (Black T, 84H-T).  
     
      
    53 I should refer here to the observations of the trial judge at Red, 57K-T:  
     
      
       
        
        “If a driver proceeding north was in the dip, the plaintiff said it was safe to move across. That is consistent with what took place and the explanation that I am examining.  
         
         
        The plaintiff, however, might have assumed that the defendant’s vehicle merging into the right-hand turning lane would have to slow down significantly before it could turn right. That scenario still posed, however, a risk of collision.  
         
         
        This view of the matter is reinforced by both Mr Hubbard’s evidence as well as Mr Relf, that the plaintiff gave no appearance of being in danger and took no evasive action.”  
        
       
       
      Conclusion  
      
    54 Ultimately, the trial judge attributed one-third contributory negligence against Mr Smurthwaite, essentially for failing to look again before departing from the stop sign in crossing an intersection he knew to be dangerous when there was oncoming traffic. That attribution of contributory negligence not being disputed by the first respondent and the appellant being unable to establish a maximum reaction time of no more than 3.5 seconds, means no basis exists for interfering with it. This is so, whatever be the outcome of the appellant’s cross-appeal seeking to attribute a proportion of his liability to the RTA. To this I now turn.  
     
      
       
      Appellant’s appeal against the dismissal of his cross-claim against the RTA  
      
    55 This aspect of the case concerns only Mr Royal and the RTA, as Mr Smurthwaite has not sought to disturb the trial judge’s decision in relation to the lack of liability on the RTA’s part. That affects the consequences of any finding against the RTA, being limited to so much of the liability as is ultimately to be apportioned to Mr Royal. I have earlier concluded that, as between Mr Royal and Mr Smurthwaite, the two thirds/one third liability attributed by the trial judge should not be disturbed. Thus the effect of any determination that the RTA must contribute as a joint tortfeasor has implications only as to the two-third’s liability earlier found against Mr Royal. It may also bear upon the making of the Bullock Order.  
     
      
    56 I have earlier quoted the only part of the judgment which deals with the RTA’s position. At a high level of generality, the evidence was to the effect that the RTA saw this area as a “black spot” and could be taken to be aware that there had been a number of serious accidents including some fatalities, over the period of time that the Highway had been upgraded (presumably from 1993). The RTA had taken some steps to deal with the problem based upon its perception of the problem being the difficulty of a driver stopped in Bago Road facing east at the intersection being aware of traffic to his or her right behind other cars proceeding north along the Highway, particularly in the left-hand lane. The trial judge concluded, presumably based upon what he saw as a failure to demonstrate causation, that he “was not satisfied that the accident represented a failure by the RTA in the circumstances of this case”. The reasons were thus conclusionary and extremely brief, leading to the appellant’s contention that they were inadequate. For reasons which I develop below, I conclude that the appellant’s submissions on this aspect should be accepted. This has a consequential effect so far as the two-thirds liability attributed to the appellant is concerned but does not affect the one-third liability attributed to Mr Smurthwaite.  
     
      
    57 I consider that the first proposition, though stated in conclusionary terms by the trial judge, was amply made out by the evidence, namely that this part of the roadway was seen by the RTA as a “black spot”. The accident statistics bore that out and include a number of serious accidents. The primary evidence for this can be found in the RTA’s own expert’s report, that by Mr Keirnan under the heading “Crash History” at para 6 of his report of 23 November 2003. That crash history deals with crashes recorded as occurring at the intersection of Pacific Highway and Bago Road between December 1993 and March 2001; that is, from the time of the dual carriageway construction to the date of the present accident. Drawing upon an RTA document included as appendix 9 to the report, that crash history is characterised as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “Details of crashes recorded as occurring at the intersection of Pacific Highway and Bago Road between December 1993 and March 2001, ie, since dual carriageway construction and this crash, are tabulated on an RTA document included as Appendix 9.  
         
         
        The following is a summary of the characteristics of these crashes:-  
        
       
      
    · There have been 20 recorded crashes that were either fatal, injury or tow away. · Two of these crashes resulted in a fatality and 14 resulted in one or more person being injured, ie, 16 casualty crashes – 2 per year. · 17 of the 20 crashes were the result of ‘cross traffic at the intersection’. · All 20 crashes were in dry weather conditions, and all but one were in daylight. · No identifiable hazardous features at the site were recorded. · One crash involved a motor cycle, one other a semi-trailer and the remainder were light passenger type vehicles. · Speed was recorded by police as a factor in one crash. · In 16 of the 20 crashes the unit at fault was identified as the eastbound driver.  
     
      
       
        
         
        Details of crashes recorded as occurring between April 2001 and March 2003 are attached as Appendix 10.  
         
         
        The following is a summary of characteristics of these crashes.  
        
       
      
    · There have been 6 crashes recorded in this 2 year period. · Two crashes resulted in a fatality and four resulted in injuries, ie, 3 casualty crashes per year. · All six crashes were cross traffic at the intersection. · Three crashes were in wet weather. · All six crashes were in daylight. · All six crashes were light passenger type vehicles. · No hazardous features were identified. · Speed was not identified by the police as a factor in all crashes.  
     
      
       
        
         
        Because of the significant number of casualty crashes over a period of 10 years, the RTA have examined possible improvements, and modifications to traffic control devices have been carried out at the intersection.” (Blue, 1117-8)  
        
       
      
    58 Under factors contributing to the crash, the analysis from the statistics was to the effect that “driver causes were most likely the dominating contributing factors to the crash”, with “driver error” being subdivided into “direct causes” and “indirect causes”. Under “direct causes” appears “improper lookout and/or inattention (unaware of the defendant’s vehicle)”, with also “improper driving technique (allegedly cutting the corner)” and “improper evasive action” and “speed above the 85 kph advisory speed”. This derives from a publication called “Aust Roads Publications” Part 4 ‘road crashes’ 1988. It describes casualty accident rates on rural roads as being a result of higher speeds and intersections in rural areas, exceeding those in urban areas. The resultant statistic was a casualty accident rate of 5.1 per 10 million entering vehicles (Blue, 1119-1120). This reflected some 20 crashes over 8 years, as borne out by the crash history in the separate report by Mr Griffiths (Blue, 1123).  
     
      
    59 Under the heading “Improvements at the Intersection” (Blue, 1121) reference is made to improvements falling short of any radical redesign, directed more to maximising the sight distance for eastbound drivers before they entered the intersection, recognising that eastbound drivers were most frequently at fault. The improvements included “to place the stop sign holding line closer to the Pacific Highway travel lanes, and thereby reduce the Highway crossing travel distance and exposure”; that step was however taken only after the date of this accident.  
     
      
    60 Mr Keirnan nevertheless concluded that, “irrespective of the circumstances of this accident, there was ample time for eastbound Bago Road drivers to view vehicles approaching from the right, wait for a suitable gap, and move the vehicle from the Bago Road Stop Sign and cross the north-bound lanes of the Pacific Highway with safety” (Blue, 1121O).  
     
      
    61 Under the heading “Intersection Design Assessment” Mr Keirnan notes that he was not provided with an accident history between 1981 and 1993 before the dual carriageway was completed. However, I would interpolate that making a dual carriageway out of a single carriageway must have increased the volume of traffic along Pacific Highway and thus have accentuated the risk of accidents. This is more especially so when you have, as here, a T-intersection between a rural road and a two-lane divided carriageway, with no significant improvements between 1993 and 2001 in the “high number of similar ‘crossing’ crashes because of highway speed ‘fatalities’” (Blue, 1122J-K).  
     
      
    62 Instead of constructing what Mr Keirnan described as “intersection design options” consisting of the much safer “left-right staggered ‘T’ treatment”, as described below, lesser improvements left the two-stage crossing as built and could be described as minor. A prime feature of these lesser improvements was a warning to “Bago Road traffic not to accidentally turn into oncoming traffic on each carriageway”, given “the long distance between the dual carriageways” (Blue, 1123F).  
     
      
    63 So far as the “staggered ‘T’ intersection” was concerned, this was recommended in the event there should be a “a relatively high volume of traffic at the intersection and/or … of the physical constraints to safe entry”. Under that option “eastbound traffic would make a left turn on to the north-bound carriageway and then merge across the travelling lanes to a right-turn lane some distance to the north” (Blue, 1123J-L).  
     
      
    64 No cost estimates are given in relation to the staggered “T” treatment. Mr Keirnan states as his conclusion, “On the information available to me it would appear that the two-stage crossing would have been adequate at the time when the design was carried out”; being 1993 (Blue, 1123K).  
     
      
    65 Importantly, Mr Keirnan in commenting on the report of Road Safety Solutions made by Mr Griffiths, cites the following from that report: “Michael Griffiths concluded that there were no obvious road environment reasons for these crashes. But he formed a view that eastbound drivers who do not carefully observe highway and traffic for a sufficient length of time, may not see vehicles that are obscured by vehicles in the adjoining lane because of the curved approach. I agree the curved approach is probably a factor.” (Blue, 1123P-S) [emphasis added]  
     
      
    66 Mr Griffiths also considered that a further warning was required for eastbound drivers to spell out that they are “about to cross a divided freeway where vehicles may be travelling at high speed” (Blue, 1124C).  
     
      
    67 He then refers to Mr Griffith’s recommendation of a modification of the intersection by stepping (staggered ‘T’) and then to provide slip lanes at highway speed for exit at a ‘T’ intersection. He states “this option was discussed earlier in the report and it is agreed that it is safer than a direct cross intersection” (Blue, 1124G-H). I consider that assessment of some importance, given the known character of that crossing to the RTA as a “black spot”.  
     
      
    68 While Mr Johnston’s report is then referred to, more relevant is the traffic engineering report of Mr Stuart-Smith, referred to at Blue, 1125. He too quotes the crash statistics and records as his conclusion “such a crash history is indicative of endemic problems at the site.” He then adds, “From a road safety perspective, this rate [of accidents] should be considered to be unacceptable for an intersection constructed in late 1993.”  
     
      
    69 In referring to visibility, Mr Stuart-Smith is quoted as setting out in his report “the published Austroads & RTA road design guidelines and records departures from these guidelines”. Relevantly this included “approach sight distance (ASD) and entry sight distance (ESD), but he agreed that safe intersection sight distance (SISD) satisfies the guidelines” (Blue, 1126N-O).  
     
      
    70 Mr Keirnan then refers to Mr Stuart-Smith’s conclusion that “the road alignment is not in accordance with current high speed design”, and states as Mr Keirnan’s own opinion that “these departures were not relevant to the crash”. Insofar as there was a suppressed premise, in the trial judge’s brief reasons I suspect that was it. However, as I later explain, that conclusion has to be re-assessed in light of the concessions Mr Keirnan later made in cross-examination.  
     
      
    71 In stating his observation of the scene at the site inspection, he made the following observation: “And if you ‘stop’ and ‘look’ there is a clear view of approaching vehicles. A four second gap was all that was required to cross safely. I do not agree that any additional signs were required particularly when vehicles are required to ‘stop’ and the plaintiff is said to have stopped”.  
     
      
    72 Mr Keirnan’s overall opinion is stated at Blue, 1127O as follows: “The RTA have upgraded the Pacific Highway and the intersection with Bago Road as traffic has increased over the past twenty years. With the information available to me, I consider that the upgrade process of road design, construction and traffic management has been sound, and in accordance with accepted practice.” He then states that “Analysis of the crash indicates it was driver inattention that was the most significant factor contributing to the crash. No typical road environment factor could be identified. But the curved highway approach may have reduced eastbound driver’s ability to anticipate safe gaps in the traffic.” (Blue, 1128F-G)  
     
      
    73 He then adds this, somewhat inconsistently with his earlier conclusion. “I consider that the most recent easterly movement of the stop sign holding line at Bago Road will reduce the crossing exposure time and probably reduce accidents”. This was because that most recent movement of the stop sign was an improvement albeit limited. It was an improvement readily capable of being made and had not been made before the accident. What was thereby recognised is that there was a visibility problem. It was not one that made any particular accident inevitable; rather it made accidents of the driver inattention type inevitable as a statistical probability, with the rate estimated at five in 10 million.  
     
      
    74 In Mr Keirnan’s earlier report of 7 April 2004 there is a concession that there were visual difficulties associated with the judgment of positions and speeds of north-bound vehicles on the Highway as they pass around the curve and approach the crest on which the intersection was situated. Mr Keirnan acknowledged that moving the stop signs and holding line in Bago Road to the east after the accident did improve visibility aspects for Bago Road east-bound drivers such as Mr Smurthwaite (Blue, 610-617). That bears directly on causation as does his evidence below in cross-examination.  
     
      
    75 The relevant cross-examination of Mr Kiernan appears at Black, 589E-640K.  
     
      
    76 That cross-examination culminates in these concessions finally made by Mr Keirnan:  
     
      
       
        
        Q. Well you say on page 18, in paragraph 1, ‘Similarly it is desirable to avoid cross intersections.’ That’s what you say?  
         
        A. Yes, well that’s an accepted fact.  
         
         
        Q. So if you were the design engineer, you would have started with the proposition that it was desirable to avoid cross intersections?  
         
        A. That’s a fact that is indisputable. When you’re-- 
         
         
        Q. So if-- 
         
        A. --when you’re duplicating an existing two lane rural highway into a divided carriageway, you can’t avoid – you can’t avoid local roads intersecting that highway. They all have to be redesigned, modified, looked at, but inevitably they end up as an at grade intersection to a fast traffic road. They even have residential gates come out onto that road. You can’t cut everyone off, you can’t put private roads leading away. But if – if it’s dangerous, some times they do.” (Black, 610P-W)  
        
       
      
    77 At Black, 613F-M severity of accidents and their higher rates was conceded:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I’m talking about in consideration of changing it from a T-intersection to a crossing intersection, the starting point would have been, it was desirable to avoid cross intersections?  
         
        A. Yes, that’s correct.  
         
         
        Q. And because he would have known, as you have told us, that intersections in rural areas usually have a higher casualty accident rates than those in urban areas?  
         
        A. Yes, severity, higher severity, yes.  
         
         
        Q. Significant and severe accidents?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. That would be the starting point, and that would, would it not, require whoever designed this intersection to be very careful on the driving task of east bound drivers?  
         
        A. Yes, it’s just automatic to take that into account.”  
        
       
      
    78 Mr Keirnan is then pressed about the staggered version of an intersection at Black, 615G-I:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And if this traffic had been diverted left out of Bago Road with a merging lane to make a right-hand turn on a link road 300 metres further north, there would have been no need for cross-intersection traffic, would there?  
         
        A. Yes, you could have done that, hmm.”  
        
       
      
    79 Finally, at Black, 630G-X appears to be the culminating concession, the reservation being only as to cost of the staggered ‘T’ intersection:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And where you have two options as provided by the guide as a guide if one of them has a statistical certainty of resulting in crossing traffic high speed collisions and the other doesn’t it would seem to have been more appropriate to choose the staggered intersection?  
         
        A. Well the staggered intersections in the Road Design Guide but its use is usually restricted to roads of some significance that are crossing a main road.  
         
         
        Q. That doesn’t mean you couldn’t have used it here does it Mr Kiernan?  
         
        A. That’s right, that’s correct. What I’m getting at is that if you have two roads intersection at right angles one is a main road and the other is what you might call a significant council road or it even could be a secondary road. To avoid that cross intersection with high traffic on the main road and also relatively high traffic on the side road a staggered t is one of the ways of avoiding that cross.  
         
         
        Q. But you see this intersection had for Pacific Highway travellers very high volumes of traffic didn’t it?  
         
        A. Yes, that’s right.  
         
         
        Q. Very high volumes of fast moving traffic?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. You’re not suggesting are you that this theoretical designer said ‘Well Bago Road wasn’t a main enough road to have a staggered intersection’. That’s not what you’re suggesting is it?  
         
        A. No, Bago Road was a t-intersection.  
         
         
        Q. So my previous question was in circumstances where on its face it appears that the cost of the staggered intersection would be less and there was a statistical certainty of high speed crossing crashes it would have been more prudent to choose the staggered t-intersection?  
         
        A. Well it may have been shall we say an option but here are other things to consider, one of them possibly is the inconvenience to residents being having to travel distances and then turn back. I don’t know. There’s acquisition costs and those sort of things.”  
        
       
      
    80 He then attempts to retreat from that concession at Black, 631D-F where he says, “I’m saying that if I was there in 1993 or 1990 when the design was done I wouldn’t have thought that a staggered t-intersection was appropriate here”. He makes the further assertion that the “intersection was built in accordance with normal requirements”. He conceded though that “a stop sign just isn’t going to always work”. Later, he concedes that in 1993 a decision was taken to retain the existing alignment. He is then pressed about what he says in his report to the effect that “the curved highway approach may have reduced eastbound drivers’ ability to anticipate safe gaps in traffic”. Here he concedes “yes, the curved roadway is, seems to be a factor which I didn’t consider it to be when I first went to the site” (Black, 637M).  
     
      
    81 He then concedes that judging the speed of approaching vehicles always has some difficulty and specifically at the subject intersection, a fact that existed prior to reconstruction in 1993 (Black, 637T-638B) when there was only one northbound lane and which, as a matter of common sense, would in my view have been exacerbated when there were two lanes carrying an increase in traffic volumes at high speed.  
     
      
    82 At Black, 638M-P he concedes in relation to Mr Stuart-Smith’s report, that the staggered T-intersections are a safer form of intersection, having earlier acknowledged the visual difficulties. He adds that making the traffic one-way rather than two-way would also have improved matters (Black, 638D-F).  
     
      
    83 Finally, at Black, 640E, he first states that he would not have considered it foreseeable in 1993 that the reconstruction of Bago Road intersection from a rural two-lane road would have been a safety problem and that he himself wouldn’t have picked it up. But then there is the following highly significant exchange (Black, 640I-K):  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Is this the case that you think that there was this massive project and along the way little intersections such as Bago Road was simply ignored in the process?  
         
        A. No, they weren’t ignored. It was just a case of a design was required for duplication. There was an opportunity to retain the existing carriageway and they took it.”  
        
       
      
    84 I need now to turn to look more closely at the history of the construction of this intersection. Prior to 1993, Bago Road met the Pacific Highway at a T-intersection. Traffic could turn left from Bago Road and head north in the left-bound lane of the Pacific Highway which was then a two-lane highway with one lane of travel in each direction. Traffic could also turn right from Bago Road and head south after having crossed only one lane of traffic. In 1993 as I have said, the RTA re-designed that intersection. It did not, however, change the geometry of the intersection. Bago Road met the Pacific Highway at a crest. For approaching Pacific Highway traffic travelling north, there was a right-hand curve and a dip in the highway south of the intersection. I would accept that this configuration, as the appellant contends, created a foreseeable problem for the observation of traffic travelling north by those vehicles exiting Bago Road. It can be taken too that those physical features must have been known to the RTA before the reconfiguration of the intersection in 1993, but neither the crest nor the curve were changed at all in the reconstruction.  
     
      
    85 The 1993 reconstruction saw the RTA, instead of choosing the staggered T-intersection, requiring traffic wishing to travel south from Bago Road to proceed across two fast moving lanes of traffic and then travelling 250 metres on the newly constructed Boyds Road to turn right onto the newly constructed south-bound carriageway. This required vehicles travelling east from Bago Road to cross the path of two lanes of high-speed through traffic. It gave rise to a statistical inevitability of a proportion of cross vehicle crashes, as demonstrated by the statistics to which I have earlier referred. While it does not make the present accident inevitable it did materially contribute to its occurrence, by creating a heightened risk of such an accident.  
     
      
    86 As to cost, further north from the Bago Road intersection, the distance between the north-bound carriageway and the new south-bound carriageway was considerably less. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the cost of the connecting roadway would likely have been correspondingly less; that is to say it is at least plausible that constructing the safer staggered T-intersection would have cost less than what was constructed. Concededly this conclusion remains contestable. But the evidentiary onus as to lesser cost had shifted to the RTA, who provided no evidence to the contrary. Nor was there any evidence from the RTA to establish that, even were it to cost less for this intersection to set up a staggered T-intersection, there would be other crossings of similar kind scattered throughout the state that would have made the cost much more expensive cumulatively. Absent such evidence, it is not a proposition that is self-evident. Clearly, in 1993 the RTA had the two options to which Mr Keirnan referred. There is no suggestion to substantiate in any way that the cost would have been significantly greater to have chosen the staggered T-intersection as against the less safe option that was adopted.  
     
      
    87 The adverse traffic history started to manifest itself almost immediately after 1993 in accidents. These by 2003 amounted to 20 vehicle crashes or more. Yet response by the RTA was minimal. “Stop ahead” and “Stop” signs had been installed in or after 1997 as also painted transfer pavement bars. These were installed in 1997 in Bago Road. They were to slow and warn traffic coming up the rise in Bago Road heading towards the intersection. But those changes did not really grapple with the danger of vehicles exiting Bago Road and crossing the path of several lanes of fast moving oncoming traffic to get to Boyds Road on the other side.  
     
      
    88 In addition, in February 1999 the north-bound right-hand turn lane had been constructed and some trees cleared on the eastern side of the north-bound carriageway. This again did little if anything to alleviate the safety problems faced by vehicles exiting Bago Road to cross the Highway in the face of oncoming traffic. Indeed it made it, on one view, more dangerous. This is because once the north-bound right-hand turn lane was constructed, the Bago Road vehicles had to cross that lane as well to reach the other side of the Pacific Highway. So despite the RTA being alive to the problem with sight distances in 1997, nothing further was done until after the present accident and then only to move the stop sign further forward.  
     
      
    89 The relevant principles applicable to authorities such as the RTA in relation to the design and construction of roads are set out by Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Brodie v Singleton Shire Council (2001) 106 CLR 512 in the paragraphs below:  
     
      
       
        
        “[150] Authorities having statutory powers of the nature of those conferred... upon the present respondents to design or construct roads, or carry out works or repairs upon them, are obliged to take reasonable care that their exercise of or failure to exercise those powers does not create a foreseeable risk of harm to a class of persons (road users) which includes the plaintiff. Where the state of a roadway, whether from design, construction, works or non-repair, poses a risk to that class of persons, then, to discharge its duty of care, an authority with power to remedy the risk is obliged to take reasonable steps by the exercise of its powers within a reasonable time to address the risk. If the risk be unknown to the authority or latent and only discoverable by inspection, then to discharge its duty of care an authority having power to inspect is obliged to take reasonable steps to ascertain the existence of latent dangers which might reasonably be suspected to exist.""  
         
         
        [151] The perception of the response by the authority calls for, to adapt the statement by Mason J in  
        Wyong Shire Council v Shirt 
         (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48, a consideration of various matters; in particular, the magnitude of the risk and the degree of probability that it will occur, the expense, difficulty and inconvenience to the authority in taking the steps described above to alleviate the danger, and any other competing or conflicting responsibility or commitments of the authority. The duty does not extend to ensuring the safety of road users in all circumstances. In the application of principle, much thus will turn upon the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence in each particular case.  
         
         
        [162] The formulation of the duty of care includes consideration of competing or conflicting responsibilities of the authorities. In the circumstances of a given case, it may be shown that it was reasonable for an authority to deal in a particular priority with repairs in various locations. The resources available to a road authority, including the availability of material and skilled labour, may dictate the pace at which repairs may be made and affect the order of priority in which they are to be made. It may be reasonable in the circumstances not to perform repairs at a certain site until a certain date, or to perform them after more pressing dangers are first addressed. Even so, it may well be reasonable for the authority to exercise other powers including, for example, by erecting warning signs, by restricting road usage or, in extreme cases, by closing the road in question.”  
        
       
      
    90 In Commissioner of Main Roads v Jones (2005) 215 ALR 418 at [40] the High Court confirmed that where the state of a highway or main road created a foreseeable risk of harm to road users, the Commissioner was obliged to take reasonable steps to alleviate the danger. On the question of reasonableness their Honours referred to Brodie at [151]. Particular emphasis had been placed during argument by the Commissioner in Jones on the concluding part of [151] in Brodie, which articulated that the duty of entities responsible for highways did not extend to ensuring the safety of road users in all circumstances, but rather depended upon the circumstances of each case. The High Court, in looking to the circumstances in Jones, held ultimately that the Commissioner was not required to take the steps of erecting signage and reducing speed limits in an effort to prevent the high-speed collision between Mr Jones’ vehicle and a wild horse crossing the highway in question. Certainly, the dangers of stray animals along that highway were known to the Commissioner, yet the risk was also an obvious one to motorists and nothing distinguished that part of the highway where the accident occurred as being especially attended by such risk. As Callinan J observed at [78]-[79]:  
     
      
       
        
        [78] The truth is that the risk that animals would stray onto the highway, the types of animals that would do so, where they would stray, and their behaviour when they did, depended upon the weather, the time of year, the time of day, and any propensities peculiar to them. These variables would necessarily complicate the making of decisions where signs should be placed, and the contents of them. Logically, the fact that these variables existed would require the appellant to shift the signs from time to time, a requirement that in the circumstances of the length and location of this long highway, and the terrain through which it passed, would be unreasonable. The alternative, that more signs should have been erected and kept in place at all times, overlooks, as did the majority in the Full Court, that a multiplicity of warning signs would detract from their effectiveness. 
         
         
        [79] An allied problem is that the majority did not say what any warning sign should contain or depict. Having regard again to the variables to which I have referred, the contents of the signs might themselves have to vary, as otherwise they might be irrelevant, or indeed perhaps even misleading on different occasions and in different places. 
        
       
      
    91 The situation here is different. Applying the principles from Jones and Brodie, the RTA was obliged to take reasonable steps to alleviate what was a known danger at a specific location and with specific options available for seeking to remedy it. That duty was owed to users of the road including, relevantly here, Mr Royal and Mr Smurthwaite. It was stated in Brodie at [153] that road design was a relevant factor when considering discharge of duty:  
     
      
       
        
        “[153] Issues may arise as to whether there was a foreseeable risk of harm arising from the design or the method of construction employed and whether, in choosing or performing the design and construction or in failing to take preventative measures or to put into place warning signs, the authority responsible failed to exercise reasonable care.”  
        
       
      
    92 In my view, the RTA failed to take the steps that would have been reasonable in this case, not just to move the stop sign as it did only after the accident but more fundamentally to have constructed a staggered T-intersection and not a cross-intersection which was pregnant with avoidable risk. It thus breached its duty of care in that regard. The remaining question is whether the supervening conduct of Mr Royal represented an intervening cause that could be said to have broken the chain of causation from the RTA’s original negligent design of the crossing so as to obviate any liability on its part in causal terms. For reasons I explain, I consider that it does not have that supervening effect.  
     
      
    93 The RTA contended that the actions of the appellant constituted an intervening cause being “the free deliberate and informed act or omission of a human being, intended to exploit the situation created by the defendant” so negativing causal connection, citing Hart and Honoré “Causation in the Law” (Oxford, 1985) at 136.  
     
      
    94 Here, however, the party A (the RTA) could readily foresee that accidents of the very kind that here occurred were highly probable. The accidents statistics at cross intersections in rural areas should have brought home to the RTA that inattention, even negligence, of the kind manifested by Mr Royal, as well as the contributory negligence of Mr Smurthwaite were features of a crossing of this kind, avoidable by the adoption of a different design which would have been reasonable in the circumstances. There is considerable authority for the proposition that where an act was reasonably foreseeable by the initial tortfeasor, the chain is not broken when that action brings about injury, so that the initial tortfeasor remains responsible for the consequences of the intervening act (see, for example, Watts v Turpin (1999) 21 WAR 402). It follows that the initial tortfeasor remains responsible for the consequences to the extent it has materially contributed to them. See also Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112 at 122, 124-5 and Haber v Walker [1963] VR 339 at 356 and the discussion in “The Law of Torts in Australia” by Trindade, Cane and Lunney (Oxford, 2006) at 559-563.  
     
      
    95 Moreover, where an intervening intentional act is the very type of act against which the defendant, being the RTA here, was obliged to take precautions, such an act does not break the chain of causation for that reason also; Reeves v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1999] 3 All ER 897 in relation to the suiciding prisoner under care of prison authorities.  
     
      
    96 However, in Bennett v Minister of Community Welfare (1992) 176 CLR 408 Gaudron J at 421 observed that  
     
      
       
        
        “the question whether some supervening event broke a chain of causation which began with or which relates back to an omission or a failure to perform a positive duty, is one that can only be answered by having regard to what would or would not have happened if the duty had been performed. It is only by undertaking that exercise that it is possible to say whether the breach was ‘still operating’ or continued to be causally significant when the harm was suffered.”  
        
       
      
    97 Applying that test here and assuming the duty was performed, one is required to hypothesise that a staggered T-intersection had been designed rather than the cross intersection. This is in order to answer the question, what would have or would not have happened in that event? If the accident would have happened anyway, the appellant must lose. When one relates that here to the very different circumstances so hypothesised, it is impossible to answer with an affirmative the question, would the accident have occurred in any event. We may start again by assuming the existence of a driver like Mr Royal, his cruise control engaged at a speed of around 105 kph who insists on his right-of-way while cutting the corner by placing himself in the right-hand lane. But then the facts to be hypothesised are of a staggered T-intersection with Mr Smurthwaite gradually entering the left-hand lane, doing so well to the left of Mr Royal whose supervening conduct is in question. It is not possible to assume that the vehicles so positioned would then have collided. In a “but for” sense, the defective design therefore materially contributed to the accident.  
     
      
    98 I consider that the supervening conduct of Mr Royal so understood did not render the antecedent breach of duty of the RTA as no longer operative. Nor did it cause that breach to cease to be causally significant so as to break the chain of causation.  
     
      
    99 The remaining question is, what proportionate responsibility should the RTA bear in relation to the 66-2/3 per cent liability attributable to Mr Royal as between Mr Royal and Mr Smurthwaite. While these matters are intrinsically not susceptible of any mathematical precision but are rather matters of impression, I would attribute a one-third responsibility to the RTA for the 66-2/3 per cent liability earlier apportioned as between Mr Royal and Mr Smurthwaite to Mr Royal. I should add that while the trial judge dealt comprehensively and clearly with the factors leading to his apportionment of damage as between Mr Royal and Mr Smurthwaite, I would respectfully conclude that he did not sufficiently engage with the issue of the RTA’s liability in terms of the sufficiency of his reasons.  
     
      
       
      Damages  
      
    100 On this issue I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Basten JA in draft. While I respectfully differ from his conclusion in regard to the position of the RTA, I would gratefully adopt both his conclusions and reasons on the question of the two appeal grounds on damages raised by the appellant. I would therefore not disturb the conclusion reached by the trial judge as regards either  
     
      
      (a) the allowance by the trial judge of expenses incurred by the plaintiff’s wife travelling to Sydney and for accommodation in Sydney whilst her husband was in hospital, nor  
      (b) the calculation of economic loss based, not on Mr Smurthwaite’s pre-accident earnings but on evidence of earnings of two comparable workers operating as tree-fallers by the company that would most likely have employed him, but for the accident. Cost Order in relation to RTA  
      
    101 In light of my earlier conclusion regarding the proportion of liability of the RTA, the Bullock Order should not stand. Rather, I consider that costs should be paid by the RTA proportionate to its liability overall.  
     
      
       
      OVERALL CONCLUSION  
      
    102 The appellant has been entirely unsuccessful in his appeal as against the first respondent but successful in his appeal against the rejection of his cross-claim for contribution against the RTA, though to the extent only of reducing his proportionate liability by one-third of the 66-2/3 per cent attributable to the appellant vis-à-vis Mr Smurthwaite. The first respondent has been wholly successful in regard to the appellant’s challenge as to the apportionment of liability between he and the appellant and first respondent and as regards the two items of damages earlier referred to. Therefore the first respondent should have his costs of the appeal paid for by the unsuccessful appellant vis-à-vis the first respondent and by the RTA, proportionate to their respective liability for the first respondent’s damages.  
     
      
    103 I would therefore propose the following orders:  
     
      
      (1) Appeal allowed in part.  
      (2) (a) Set aside the order of the trial judge dismissing the appellant’s cross-claim against the RTA, and  
       
        
        (b) In lieu thereof, order that the RTA pay the appellant one-third of the judgment entered against him in favour of the first respondent.  
        
       
      (3) Set aside the costs order made in the District Court and in lieu thereof order that:  
       
        
        (a) the appellant pay the first respondent’s costs of the trial and of the appeal;  
         
        (b) the RTA pay to the appellant:  
         
          
          (i) one-third of the costs payable by the appellant under para (a) above;  
           
          (ii) the appellant’s costs of the trial relating to his cross-claim against the RTA.  
          
         
        
       
      (4) Order that - 
       
        
        (a) the appellant pay two-thirds of the first respondent’s costs of the appeal, and  
         
        (b) the RTA pay one-third of the first respondent’s costs of the appeal. 
        
       
      
    104 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Santow JA.  
     
      
    105 BASTEN JA: On the morning of 12 March 2001, Mr George Smurthwaite (“the plaintiff”) was driving in a south-easterly direction on Bago Road, between Wauchope and Laurieton on the north coast of the State. Bago Road intersected with the northbound lanes of the Pacific Highway. For the plaintiff, crossing from west to east, the intersection was controlled by a Stop sign. At that point, the highway had two lanes for through traffic proceeding north, a left turn lane for traffic turning into Bago Road, and a right turn lane for traffic turning off the highway to the east down Boyd Road, which was the extension of Bago Road on the east side of the highway. 
     
      
    106 The plaintiff stopped his vehicle on Bago Road, then proceeded to cross. There appear to have been four vehicles on the highway in the vicinity of the intersection when Mr Smurthwaite arrived at it. Two were in the left-hand turn lane and turned into Bago Road; a third was a vehicle driven by Mr Grant Royal (“the defendant”) and the fourth a Telstra van, which was a little distance behind the defendant. The plaintiff crossed the through lanes, but was then hit by the defendant’s vehicle which collided head on with the right-hand centre of the plaintiff’s vehicle. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries.  
     
      
    107 On 3 May 2002 he commenced proceedings against the defendant in the District Court. On 15 August 2002, the defendant filed a defence denying that it was negligent and alleging contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. On 25 October 2002 the defendant cross-claimed against the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales (“the RTA”) claiming contribution in relation to the plaintiff’s claim. On 10 December 2002, the plaintiff amended his claim so as to join the RTA as a second defendant, making similar allegations of breach of duty as those contained in the cross-claim.  
     
      
    108 The trial was conducted by Phelan DCJ and ran for a period of 12 days. His Honour found that the defendant was negligent, a conclusion which is not challenged on this appeal. He also found that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent to an extent of one-third. He assessed the plaintiff’s damages at a fraction over $1.3 million. The judgment in favour of the plaintiff, after allowing for contributory negligence, was $871,019.50. His Honour found that the RTA was not liable and ordered the defendant to bear the costs payable by the plaintiff to the RTA.  
     
      
       
      Issues on appeal 
      
    109 This appeal was brought by the defendant: there is no cross-appeal. The primary issue sought to be agitated on the appeal was the dismissal of the defendant’s case against the RTA. In addition, the defendant challenged the assessment of contributory negligence. He sought, in effect, to reduce his liability to 4%, by claiming that the plaintiff should bear 80% of the responsibility for the accident and that the RTA should contribute 80% of his (the defendant’s) proportion. 
     
      
    110 In addition, the defendant challenged the award of damages in two respects. First, he challenged the inclusion in the damages of expenses incurred by the plaintiff’s wife, being travel and accommodation costs incurred by her to allow her to be with her husband whilst he was in hospital in Sydney. The second challenge concerned the assessment of economic loss, which his Honour based on comparable earnings of tree fallers employed by the company which would probably have taken over the plaintiff’s employment shortly after the accident, had he not been injured, instead of using the actual earnings of the plaintiff in the year prior to the accident. 
     
      
       
      Issues of liability 
      
    111 In order to assess the complaints in relation to the assessment of liability of the respective parties, it is necessary to consider some further aspects of the circumstances in which the accident occurred. The first aspect concerns the physical features of the roadways in the vicinity of the intersection; the second concerns the behaviour of the plaintiff and the third the behaviour of the defendant. 
     
      
    112 In relation to the first matter, the intersection was set in a State forest, on what has been described as a crest of a hill. For drivers coming from the direction of Wauchope on Bago Road, there was a reasonably steep inclination, approaching the Stop sign at the highway. For drivers going north on the Pacific Highway, the inclination was gentle and although the dip in the highway to the south of the intersection meant that a driver at the Bago Road Stop sign could not see the road surface at all points, there was no interference with vision of traffic approaching along the highway. 
     
      
    113 Of greater relevance was the fact that the Pacific Highway curved to the east on either side of the intersection. As Bago Road approached from the west, as the plaintiff looked to his right, the highway curved away from his side of the road and he was required to look across a grassy shoulder in order to see traffic approaching from a distance of more than about 200 metres. He would have had a reasonably unrestricted sightline of traffic which was no more than 280 metres or so from the intersection. On the other hand, because of the curvature of the highway, there may have been some difficulty in determining in which lane an approaching vehicle was situated, until it was within 150 metres.  
     
      
    114 The speed limit on the highway was 100 kilometres per hour, but there was an advisory speed sign some 300 metres before the intersection which showed 85 kilometres per hour as the appropriate speed for negotiating the bend. 
     
      
    115 As already mentioned, there was a right turn lane on the highway for traffic wishing to take Boyd Road in an easterly direction. That lane commenced some 210 metres before the intersection with Bago and Boyd Roads. The left turn lane for traffic leaving the highway and travelling to the west along Bago Road commenced approximately 150 metres before the intersection. 
     
      
    116 Each of the lanes on the highway was marked with arrows. Thus each of the turn lanes had arrows indicating that they were for turning traffic only and the two through lanes had arrows indicating that they were through lanes only. 
     
      
    117 Prior to 1993, the Pacific Highway had been one lane in each direction at this point, but, with the construction in that year of a separate southbound carriageway to the east, the two lanes had become northbound lanes only. Further, prior to 1993, the Bago Road point of entry to the highway from the west had been a T-intersection, with no cross-traffic. The Boyd Road extension had been built at the same time as the separate southbound carriageway, primarily, one would infer, to allow traffic coming out of Bago Road to reach the southbound carriageway. It therefore became a cross-intersection at that time. 
     
      
    118 It was the creation of a cross-intersection which lay at the heart of the defendant’s case against the RTA. He asserted that it would have been considerably safer to adopt a “staggered T-intersection” configuration rather than a direct cross-intersection. This would have required traffic coming out of Bago Road which wished to go south rather than north to turn into the left-hand of the northbound lanes, cross to the right-hand lane and then turn right at some distance north of the point of entry to the highway so as to reach a new connecting road to the southbound carriageway. 
     
      
    119 The particulars of breach of duty on the part of the RTA, as first provided in the cross-claim, and adopted by the plaintiff, were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Provision of an intersection of unsafe design. 
         
        (b) Failure to provide an intersection that was safe for use by motorists such as the Plaintiff. 
         
        (c) Provision of inadequate signage warning of the potentially dangerous nature of the intersection. 
         
        (d) Failure to take appropriate steps for the safety of motorists such as the Plaintiff following previous collisions at the said intersection. 
         
        (e) Failure to warn the Plaintiff and Defendant of the dangers to which they were exposed. 
        
       
       
      A final particular alleged breach of statutory duty, which had been separately pleaded by reference generally to “the provisions of” the  
      Transport Administration Act 
       1988 (NSW) and of the  
      Roads Act 
       1993 (NSW). These matters were not pursued on appeal. 
       
      
    120 Particulars (c) and (e) complained of inadequate signage and failure to warn of dangers, presumably by signs, rumble strips or other measures (not identified) which might be taken by a road authority. In substance, these particulars were not pursued on the appeal. Particular (d) was concerned with steps which might have been taken after construction of the intersection, following previous accidents, but which had not been taken prior to the accident in March 2001. Again, these steps were not identified in the evidence and may be put to one side for present purposes. It was certainly not suggested that significant additional expense would not have been incurred had it been considered necessary to change the configuration after the construction work was undertaken in 1993. No evidence was led to that effect and the course of argument on the appeal assumed that the relevant breach of duty occurred whenever the design was adopted by the RTA at some unknown date prior to construction in 1993. 
     
      
    121 That leaves the first two particulars which may each be treated as a complaint in relation to unsafe design. They were supported by evidence that a staggered T-intersection would have been safer. Although no one gave evidence as to the particular circumstances of the present topography and land ownership, there was evidence of a general kind which might have supported the view that a staggered T-intersection would have been cheaper, or at least no more expensive, than the cross-intersection adopted by the RTA at some date prior to construction in 1993. That evidence assumed that the same turn lanes would have been required, but that the cross-road to the southbound carriageway, would have been further to the north and would actually have been shorter and therefore cheaper, because the carriageways converged towards the north. 
     
      
    122 Reference will be made to this evidence below, but it was not entirely persuasive. Thus, no consideration was given in any evidence to which the Court was taken as to how a staggered T-intersection would have been mirrored on the southbound carriageway, nor was there consideration to the specific topography of the land to the north, nor as to the possible confusion which might have been caused in the minds of motorists approaching along Bago Road who were required to go north before turning south into the southbound carriageway. Other questions might have been identified by appropriately briefed professionals. The defendant criticised the lack of evidence provided by the RTA, either by way of officers to explain the choice, or documents revealing the decision-making process undertaken prior to 1993. It will be necessary to return to these criticisms shortly. 
     
      
    123 The defendant obtained two expert reports from consulting engineers in relation to the cause of the accident. The first, dated 11 April 2003 was prepared by Mr Stuart-Smith, a consulting traffic engineer. With respect to the type of intersection, he expressed the following view (Report, 11 April 2003, p 23): 
     
      
       
        
        “In this case, the minor road traffic (from Bago Road) was limited by a Stop sign; nonetheless, the characteristics of this type of intersection make it less desirable, in general, than alternative designs. 
        
       
       
        
        The specific alternative treatment that would have been applicable at Bago Road would have been a ‘staggered T’ treatment (the Guide, section 5.5.2). This type of intersection does not involve traffic crossing directly across the carriageway, but requires a merge into the left lane of the major road, followed by a merge into lane 2 and a subsequent right turn. This sequence of events exposes vehicles from both approaches to substantially lower risks of serious crashes.” 
        
       
       
      The reference to “the Guide” was a reference to a document identified as “Guide to Traffic Engineering Practice”, (Austroads, 1988). Although Mr Stuart-Smith thought that the essential design elements were only just complied with, he did not suggest that the Guide was breached by the characteristics of the Bago Road intersection. 
       
      
    124 A second expert called by the defendant was Mr Michael Griffiths, a consultant with degrees in bio-medical and mechanical engineering. Mr Griffiths restricted his comments to the issues which arose from the configuration of the intersection, as relevant to the actual accident which occurred. As will be noted below, the significant features of the accident in this respect were that the plaintiff stopped at the Stop sign, before starting across the highway; there was no traffic which was likely to have obscured his view of the defendant’s vehicle and the intersection was well-known to both drivers. Mr Griffiths noted (Report, 20 September 2002, p 17): 
     
      
       
        
        “In terms of sight distances, there was good visibility at the intersection for eastbound motorists undertaking the task of crossing the northbound lanes of the Pacific Highway, provided they gave more than a quick appraisal, and continued observing approach vehicles until those in the foreground had passed the intersection. 
        
       
       
        
        Approaching vehicles could be seen from a distance of 250 metres. A vehicle travelling at a speed of 105 kilometres per hour, that is 29.17 metres/second, would have taken 8.57 seconds to reach the intersection from when they first became visible. 
        
       
       
        
        The Police observed that it took typical vehicles in the range of 2.8 to 3.5 seconds to cross the northbound lanes from a stationery position at the ‘Stop’ in Bago Road. At my site visit, I made observations which confirm that it took typical vehicles in the order of 3 to 3 1/2 seconds to cross the northbound lanes from the holding line at the ‘Stop’ sign in Bago Road.  
        
       
       
        
        From the above, it is obvious that there was plenty of time for eastbound motorists to safely cross.” 
        
       
      
    125 Although Mr Griffiths considered that various warnings might have been given to eastbound motorists on Bago Road, given that the plaintiff was an experienced driver, who had used the road frequently, it seems unlikely that these would have had any causative relevance to the accident in question. 
     
      
    126 A third expert was called by the plaintiff. He was Mr Grant Johnston, a chartered professional engineer. His first report was dated 9 September 2002, before the plaintiff joined the RTA, and it suggested no defect in the design of the intersection. A second report, dated September 2003, filed well after the amendment to the statement of claim, again made no comment on the design of the intersection. 
     
      
    127 The fourth expert called was Mr Kiernan, a consulting civil engineer instructed by the RTA. Mr Kiernan expressly commented on the possibility of the cross-intersection as built and the possible alternative of a staggered T-intersection. His conclusion, in his first report of 24 November 2003 was as follows (p 22): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Two Stage Crossing  
        – this option was chosen by the RTA, and it is typical of many intersections with low local road traffic on this and other dual carriageway highways. I would not have expected a ‘cross-intersection’ safety problem at this location. But because of the long distance between the dual carriageways, a prime consideration with this option would have been to warn Bago Road traffic not to accidentally turn into oncoming traffic on each carriageway. I understand this has happened, but accidents have not occurred. Given that similar intersections with dual carriageway roads are common through the road system, its choice by RTA seems reasonable. 
        
       
       
        
        Staggered ‘T’ Intersection 
         – If there is relatively high volume of traffic at the intersection and/or there are obvious physical constraints to safe entry, the staggered ‘T’ intersection is an alternative treatment. In this option, eastbound traffic would make a left turn onto the northbound carriageway and then merge across the travelling lanes to a right turn lane some distance to the north. 
        
       
       
        
        A detailed analysis of these options would be required including costs estimates to decide if the usually more costly staggered ‘T’ treatment was warranted. On the information available to me it would appear that the two stage crossing would have been adequate at the time when the design was carried out.” 
        
       
      
    128 Mr Kiernan noted Mr Stuart-Smith’s view that a staggered T-intersection should have been built and agreed that it was “an option”: p 26. He continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no information available to critically examine the basis for the decision to retain Bago Road intersection rather than construct a staggered ‘T’. And it cannot be fairly assessed in hindsight.” 
        
       
      
    129 The defendant sought to turn this last comment to his advantage, noting that the RTA had apparently failed to supply either the Court or its own expert with the necessary information to assess the decision to adopt a cross-intersection rather than the alternative safer model before the construction was undertaken in 1993. There was further evidence, which it will be necessary to consider, in relation to this question, but it is convenient at this stage to refer to the basis of this complaint. Thus, the defendant appears to have issued a Freedom of Information request and two subpoenas to the RTA. The Freedom of Information request, which was contained in the material supplied by the RTA, sought information relating to “any roadworks carried out in the 5 years prior to the accident” and, relevantly, all information regarding “design considerations in relation to the intersection of the Pacific Highway and Bago Road (‘the intersection’) including but not limited to all information regarding the compliance of the intersection with normal freeway guidelines”. Other matters sought related to reviews, apparently subsequent to the construction of the intersection. As this was not a “freeway” reference to freeway guidelines was somewhat misconceived; further, the request for information “regarding” design considerations, may not have been understood as requiring reference to any decision-making process undertaken prior to 1993. 
     
      
    130 A subpoena for early production, dated 22 January 2004, contained a schedule seeking information, including information regarding design considerations in relation to the intersection, in similar terms to the Freedom of Information request, but limited to the period from 1 January 2003 to the date of the subpoena. A second subpoena apparently issued on 24 January 2005, related to documents with respect to the occupation, ownership, purchase or resumption of land in the vicinity of the intersection, together with certain other documents created in 1996 and later. No reference was made to documents with respect to the planning and design of the intersection, and related areas of the Pacific Highway, prior to its construction in 1993. In my view, neither the request nor the subpoenas specifically sought material directly relevant to the decision-making of the RTA in designing the intersection prior to its construction in 1993. 
     
      
    131 The one item which was known to exist and was provided as an attachment to Mr Kiernan’s report was a survey of casualty accident rates per million vehicles entering various kinds of intersection, apparently produced by the Road Construction Authority of Victoria and quoted in the 1991 RTA Road Design Guide. The figures were broken down according the type of intersection, but the two specific figures relied upon by the defendant were the casualty rate for rural cross-intersections without signals, which was 5.2, as compared with staggered T rural intersections, the figure for was 2.9. (The figure for rural T-intersections without signals was 3.3). The comment in the Guide accompanying the table was that “on rural roads staggered ‘T’ intersections are preferred over cross intersections”.  
     
      
    132 The “crash history”, at least in relation to accidents involving casualties, was provided with respect to this intersection, since its construction in 1993. According to calculations based on estimates of vehicle movements on both roads, a casualty rate of 5.1 was established. This was almost identical with the figures quoted above and apparently available to the RTA before construction commenced. One inference which may be drawn from this information is that the casualty accident rate at this intersection was precisely what was to be expected. This suggests that the intersection in question was no more dangerous than others of a similar design and, as Mr Kiernan suggested, there are many such intersections on similar roads around the State and it is therefore difficult to draw the inference that the construction of a particular intersection on this design involved a breach of the RTA’s duty of care, without more information as to the views of relevant experts in, say, 1992; specific considerations relevant to this intersection, and the broader consequences of such a conclusion in relation to the cost of road construction across rural New South Wales. 
     
      
    133 Beyond this material, it is necessary to give consideration to the cross-examination of Mr Kiernan at trial. Mr Kiernan was cross-examined, for example, in relation to his evidence that the intersection did not comply with guidelines concerning a measurement identified as “entering sight distance” but did comply with the guidelines in relation to a measurement known as “safe intersection sight distance”. In relation to the thinking of the designer of the intersection, it was put to him that that person had reasoned as follows (Tcpt, 5 May 2005, p 23): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. … I know we’ll comply with the minimum and will comply with the SISD and not only that, we’ll now make it a crossing of the highway, is that what you’re suggesting the designer did? 
         
        A. That’s right, that would have been my decision. 
         
        … 
         
        Q. So what you’re saying is look, so long as we scrape in to some part of the guidelines, that’s OK? 
         
        A. Well before the guidelines were written we probably had sight distances that refer to visibility between vehicles and as long as you can see a vehicle at the intersection and vice versa and there is sufficient time for either driver to take action, depending on the circumstance, then that’s acceptable. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. There’s a lot of variables in that before you get to acceptable aren’t there? 
         
        A. Well I think putting it another way, the ASD and entry sight distance are not relevant to this incident. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The ASD and the entry sight distance certainly affect visual perception of the site? 
         
        A. Not relevant to this incident. 
        
       
       
      That view was consistent with a view he had expressed in his first report (p 19) in following terms: 
       
       
        
        “Irrespective of the circumstances of this accident, there was ample time for eastbound Bago Road drivers to view vehicles approaching from the right, wait for a suitable gap, and move the vehicle from the Bago Road Stop sign and cross the northbound lanes of the Pacific Highway with safety.” 
        
       
      
    134 He was then cross-examined at some length to achieve agreement that accidents at intersections were inevitable and that there was a higher rate of accidents at cross-intersections than at T-intersections. He was cross-examined as to the possibility of a staggered T-intersection, declined to comment on the cost (Tcpt, p 42) but agreed that the cost of a paved link road of 30 or 40 metres would have been less than the cost for 250 metres. While accepting that there were alternatives, he remained of the view that he would not change the Bago Road alignment: p 42(48). After the interposition of another witness, counsel for the defendant returned to the cross-examination, and sought a number of concessions (Tcpt, p 57-58): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. So my previous question was in circumstances where on its face it appears that the cost of the staggered intersection would be less and there was a statistical certainty of high speed crossing crashes it would have been more prudent to choose the staggered T-intersection? 
         
        A. Well it may have been shall we say an option but there are other things to consider, one of them possibly is the inconvenience to resident being having to travel distances and then turn back. I don’t know. There’s acquisition costs and those sort of things. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So the benefit cost analysis would say ‘Well we might have to divert them 300 metres up the road and bring them 300 metres back. We can’t do that. We’ll opt for the statistical certainty of the crashes.’ You’re not suggesting that are you? 
         
        A. No, the statistical certainty is a very difficult to sort of put into context with this intersection and a staggered T. I’m saying that if I was there in 1993 or 1990 when the design was done I wouldn’t have thought that a staggered T intersection was appropriate here. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Mr Kiernan my question was if you regard the modifications since as appropriate from a safety perspective are you seriously suggesting that you, if you were the designer at the time prior to 1993 wouldn’t have thought of those? 
         
        A. Wouldn’t have thought of those. I think the intersection was built in accordance with normal requirements. 
        
       
      
    135 The plaintiff’s expert, Mr Johnston, was also cross-examined by counsel for the defendant. He gave evidence in the following terms (Tcpt, 28 April 2005, pp 24-25): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. … In terms of accessing highways, would you agree with the proposition that it’s not really acceptable to have an incoming road such as Bago Road completely crossing the highway as it did in this circumstance? 
         
        A. I wouldn’t say that it’s not acceptable, there’s nothing in the design standards that says you can’t do it. If it’s a freeway you can’t do it, and this is a divided carriageway, but it’s not a freeway, it does have graded intersections. We don’t have many where we do that in New South Wales as many, Victoria do it quite a bit. It’s not a great intersection – the best way of doing it at an intersection, and if you have significant exit volumes, then often you need just to allow them to turn left and provide a further U-turn facility upstream. But I wouldn’t say it’s not acceptable, there’s nothing that says you can’t do it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well when you say ‘not acceptable’ you mean within the guidelines …  
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. … that are applicable for example to the RTA? 
         
        A. That’s right, there’s nothing that says they can’t build an intersection of that type. So I wouldn’t say it’s not acceptable. 
        
       
       
      Analysis of expert opinions 
      
    136 In the course of the expert evidence, various options for dealing with traffic coming out of Bago Road and wishing to proceed to the south were discussed. Reference has been made to the staggered T-intersection as an available alternative to the cross-intersection, because that was the option which appeared to be preferred by Mr Stuart-Smith. However, no expert said that it would have been unreasonable for a traffic design engineer at the RTA in 1990-1992 to select the cross-intersection. That some engineers would have preferred the alternative does not establish the defendant’s case that it was negligent not to adopt that alternative. 
     
      
    137 Further, the defendant placed significant emphasis on the inevitability of accidents and the higher rate of accidents at a cross-intersection. The statistics available in 1992 may have given a general indication of safety factors and various sorts of intersections, but require some care in determining whether a breach of duty is established by the adoption of cross-intersections as a solution in a particular instance. 
     
      
    138 The kind of risks that may be involved can be illustrated by other material in the evidence. For example, Senior Constable Bentley was one source of information as to the time it took for vehicles coming out of Bago Road to cross the highway. In a statement dated 23 March 2001, he reported (par 26): 
     
      
       
        
        “I timed the vehicles which stopped at the intersection prior to crossing (less than half of the traffic did not stop at the signs or lines before crossing the Highway).” 
        
       
       
      The phrase “less than half” is somewhat imprecise, but presumably means that a significant number of vehicles, perhaps approaching 50%, failed to comply with the Stop sign. That conduct, whether deliberate or accidental, must have materially increased the risk of accidents at the intersection, but it was a risk which was irrelevant to the present case. In addition, there was file note in the RTA papers (Exhibit X) dated 31 October 2002 which reported: 
       
       
        
        “Whilst performing roadwork at the intersection of Bago Road [and] Pacific Highway, I have seen on numerous occasion vehicles exiting Bago turn south into the northbound traffic lane. The vehicles travel until they get to the Wrong Way Go Back sign by which time they have travelled 150 metres against the northbound traffic flow. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        As a separate issue I have observed cars turning left from Bago Road into the northbound lane and travelling along this for some distance before realising they are headed in the wrong direction. Some drivers perform a U-turn manoeuvre others reverse their vehicles and travel south in the northbound lane to return to the Bago intersection and cross to the southbound lanes. 
        
       
       
        
        I have serious safety concerns as these incidents occur on a regular basis and it is only a matter of time before a major accident occurs with loss of life.” 
        
       
      
    139 Again, the dangers identified in this memorandum were not relevant to the accident which occurred in the present case. They do, however, illustrate the point that there may be numerous risks associated with the particular intersection, which may in turn affect the statistics as to accidents, but which are irrelevant in the present case. 
     
      
    140 Whether there was a breach of duty on the part of the RTA in the design of the intersection can only be answered by identifying, as best one can, the cause of the accident in the present case. To argue that the intersection involved avoidable risks and, in some other respects, breaches of duty of care in its design, which could reasonably have been rectified by adopting a different design, is not to the point. To say that, for reasons irrelevant to the present circumstances, there should have been no cross-intersection and that if there had been no cross-intersection the accident would not have occurred, is not a permissible means of demonstrating that the conduct of the RTA materially contributed to the accident, in the sense that rendered it a joint tortfeasor. Causation will only be satisfied if a risk negligently created by the RTA materially contributed to the collision. Whether that was so can only be answered after identifying particular causal features of this accident. As the trial judge appears to have concluded, identified inadequacies in the design of the intersection did not contribute to the accident in a causative sense. 
     
      
       
      Conduct of plaintiff and defendant 
      
    141 Given the severity of his injuries, the defendant was, unsurprisingly, unable to recall what had happened immediately prior to the collision. However, it is clear from other evidence that he had stopped at the Stop sign and, being familiar with the intersection, one would infer that he looked to the south, in which case he would have seen the defendant’s vehicle. The defendant gave evidence that he saw the plaintiff’s vehicle stationary at the Stop sign. If the plaintiff had accelerated across the intersection in a normal manner, he would have taken no more than 3.5 seconds to cross the highway. He had actually crossed the two through lanes and was in the right-hand turn lane for traffic coming north on the highway when the collision occurred. 
     
      
    142 Evidence of what did happen was provided by the defendant, two other drivers, and an analysis of the defendant’s skid-marks. One of the witnesses was a Telstra technician, Mr Relf, who was driving north on the Pacific Highway a little behind the defendant’s vehicle when it reached the intersection. Mr Relf gave evidence as to the conduct of the defendant’s vehicle referred to as “the VL” as it approached the right-hand curve at the Bago Road intersection. Mr Relf noted that the curve was preceded by a short left-hand curve. In his statement of 20 March 2001, he described the behaviour as follows (par 14 ff): 
     
      
       
        
        “14. I saw the VL in the left hand lane on the left hand corner. It stayed in that lane until the start the right hand curve. As the VL approached the right hand curve, it started to move from the left hand lane and into the right hand lane. The VL indicated to move right and because there was no traffic in front of it, it looked like the VL was cutting the corner trying to straighten the curve. 
        
       
       
        
        15. It kept travelling in the right hand lane. There’s a turning lane on the right and a turning lane on the left approaching Bago Road. The VL didn’t indicate, but it moved over into the right hand turning lane. I was about three or four seconds, at that speed, behind the VL. … 
        
       
       
        
        16. I watched the VL wondering what it was doing in the right hand turning lane and not slowing down. … Halfway between when I could first see the intersection and where the intersection is, I saw a green coloured station wagon coming from my left on Bago Road across the highway. 
        
       
       
        
        17. The VL was still in the right hand turning lane.” 
        
       
      
    143 A second witness to the accident was Mr George Hubbard, a forest supervisor, who was travelling along Bago Road and approached the intersection behind the plaintiff. In his statement of 31 March 2001 he described the circumstances as follows (at par 7 ff): 
     
      
       
        
        “7. As I was coming to the intersection, I saw a green station wagon stopped at the stop sign waiting to cross the Highway. Just after I could first see the green car, it started to move off. I started to pull up at the stop sign where it had been stopped. As I was pulling up, I was looking to the right along the Highway. … 
        
       
       
        
        8. I saw there was one car that had turned left off the Highway into Bago Road and there were another two in the turning lane with their blinkers on, moving up to Bago Road to turn off the Highway. I came to a complete stop at the stop sign. I saw a Telecom vehicle and another vehicle, both of them were white. … 
        
       
       
        
        9. The second white car was in the right hand turning lane cutting the corner. I couldn’t tell what speed either of the cars were doing because of the curve on the highway, the second white car was going faster than the white Telecom vehicle. While I was watching the two cars on my right, I saw the front of the car cutting the corner dip under brakes and start to lock-up. … The white car hadn’t swerved at all – it was cutting the corner, then instantly started braking. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … When it was braking, it made me look back to the green station wagon. I saw that the back half of it was still in the right hand overtaking lane. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        10. The green car didn’t speed up or slow down – to me it looked like there was no reaction by the driver to the fact that the white car was under brakes and coming straight for him.” 
        
       
      
    144 Mr Relf gave evidence on 21 April 2005, in similar terms to his statement: Tcpt, 21 April 2005. Mr Hubbard also gave evidence in similar terms, on the same day. 
     
      
    145 The defendant declined to give a statement to police, but his conduct, as revealed in his oral evidence to the trial judge, was remarkable. He agreed with the proposition that he had travelled the road on many occasions and drove with the vehicle on cruise control set at 105 kilometres per hour (Tcpt, 29 April 2005, p 2). At the beginning of his cross-examination, the following exchange occurred (p 8): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. You’ve told us … that your system involved essentially travelling this road on cruise control? 
         
        A. Yes it did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s what you did invariably? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In dry weather and in wet? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Bald tyres and all? 
         
        A. Pardon me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You see your vehicle had bald tyres didn’t it? 
         
        A. No it didn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you present in court when the court was told that your front tyres … were devoid of legal tread? 
         
        … 
         
        A. I didn’t hear him say anything about the legal tread. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you suggest your front tyres were not devoid of legal tread? 
         
        A. Yes I do. 
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. … So if the officer suggests they did, he were wrong? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And if various experts have suggested to this court they did they were wrong as well? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
    146 In a statement given to the investigator, quoted by his Honour (Judgment, p 10) the defendant, on 2 August 2001, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I approached the Bago Road intersection I was doing 105 kph, dead on. I had the cruise control set. As I came up I was in the left lane, there were two cars in front of me and I moved out to the right to overtake them. … I used my blinker. … By the time I overtook the two cars I was just at the start of the corner immediately before the Bago Road intersection. … As I came up the hill I saw Mr Smurthwaite’s car at the intersection on the left. When I first saw him he was rolling up to the stop sign. I saw him actually stop and then kept coming through. When I saw him coming through I thought I might have an accident with him. I looked in my mirrors and didn’t see anything all, I then hit my brakes and steered to my right. I thought that by doing that I would miss his car. When I first saw his car I was in the right hand traffic lane, there was a right turn lane still on my right. My car skidded and moved to the right, I consciously steered the car to the right to avoid him.” 
        
       
      
    147 The aspect of this statement which concerned the time at which he entered the right-hand turn lane was challenged in cross-examination. The skid marks left by the defendant, the right-hand mark being some 25 metres long, indicated that he was already wholly within the right-hand turn lane prior to “hitting the brakes”. 
     
      
    148 He was cross-examined as to his speed and said that he would have gone through a known speed camera near Heron’s Creek at 105 kilometres per hour, even though the speed limit was 100 kilometres per hour. He was asked (Tcpt, 29 April 2005, p 13): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. I suppose you would do that because you reckon you’d be able to get away with it? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You think that is responsible driving, do you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        … 
         
        Q. I take it from that that you regard the 100 kilometre per hour speed limit as a token? 
         
        A. As a token, sorry? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just a token, a guide is that correct? 
         
        A. As long as you’re within a certain distance of that, yes. 
        
       
      
    149 He was asked if he totally ignored the advisory 85 kilometre per hour speed sign and he denied that but said that he would slow down “if the conditions call for it”. The following exchange then occurred (Tcpt, p 15): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. There’s a reluctance to come off cruise control isn’t there? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why is that? 
         
        A. Because I don’t like coming off cruise control. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is that? 
         
        A. I prefer to drive on cruise control. That way you get better fuel economy and you – your speed’s not fluctuating. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It’s important to stay on cruise control as long you can? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. So you know a fair bit about that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are there some inherent dangers associated with cruise control? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What are they? 
         
        A. Just braking distances, things like that. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It comprises the braking distances doesn’t it? 
         
        A. It does because if you don’t touch the brakes to turn it off it keeps going at the speed you’re going. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. So it comprises reaction time? 
         
        A. I wouldn’t say reaction time. I’d say braking distances. If you don’t turn it off when you see something. 
        
       
      
    150 He was cross-examined at some length about the point at which he had commenced to brake and his position on the road when he first saw the plaintiff move off. At p 28, the following evidence was given: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Mr Royal, … I want you to accept as fact that the left hand turning lane is 150 metres south of the intersection, and you have told us that you proceeded to overtaken those vehicles that were going to turn left some distance south of the left hand turning lane? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So given that, those facts, doing the best you can you saw Smurthwaite’s vehicle move off when you were about 150 metres back from the intersection. That’s correct isn’t it? 
         
        A. I still can’t be certain on how far back I was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Doing the best you can about that distance? 
         
        A. Give or take, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On reflection now, the plain simple fact is that, had you not insisted on your right of way and had you accepted that cruise control ought to be deactivated you could simply have pulled up before you got to the intersection couldn’t you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
    151 The cross-examination continued: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. By the way, of course you had some form if you understand that description, for utilising a right hand turn bay, yet travelling straight ahead? 
         
        A. Pardon me? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You see, a little earlier on this morning you simply used a right hand turn bay in a setting where you were going straight ahead along the Pacific Highway, didn’t you? 
         
        A. That section’s actually the overtaking lane. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I beg yours? 
         
        A. That’s actually an overtaking lane. It’s marked as a right hand turning lane as well but it is an overtaking lane. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And in that lane so created there were right hand turn arrows? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you suggesting that that was nevertheless to be utilised for a driver travelling and continuing to travel north? 
         
        A. Yes. When it was first built, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So that you accept that there were right hand turn arrows there? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. There was no arrow indicating one straight ahead was there? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And yet your understanding of the rules of the road was such that you could use that lane where right hand turn arrows existed, you’re entitled to use it go straight ahead? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
    152 He then sought to distinguish his view of the right-hand turn lane at the Bago Road intersection, but on the basis that it did not continue far through the intersection. 
     
      
    153 Accepting the defendant’s evidence that he was travelling at 105 kilometres per hour when he saw the plaintiff move off from the Stop sign, that speed equated with 29.2 metres per second so that, even if the plaintiff had taken 4 seconds to reach the right-hand turn lane across the highway, which seems generous, and assuming that the defendant had remained in the through lanes, he would have been able to travel 116 metres before colliding with the plaintiff. Two inferences can be drawn from this fact. The first is that if, as the trial judge accepted, he was 150 metres back when he saw the plaintiff move off, he had ample time to slow down sufficiently to avoid the plaintiff’s vehicle. The other inference is that he was well within view of the plaintiff when the plaintiff commenced to cross the highway, but was really too close for the plaintiff to safely undertake the crossing at that stage. If the defendant was in the right-hand lane, there is no reasonable explanation for the failure of the plaintiff to see him, if that had occurred. In my view the probable explanation for the plaintiff’s conduct is that he observed the defendant in the right-hand turn lane and, without realising his speed, or that he was not slowing down, assumed that he intended to turn right. To do that he would have had to dramatically reduce his speed before reaching the Boyd Road turning and the plaintiff would no doubt have crossed the highway comfortably in front of him. It is possible that the plaintiff had seen him indicate when he moved into the right-hand lane, and thought he was indicating an intention to turn right. 
     
      
    154 The inference that he went into the right-hand turn lane near its commencement is consistent with the evidence of Mr Relf, is consistent with his view that he could use a right-hand lane as an overtaking lane even though he was travelling through the intersection and was consistent with his intention to keep on cruise control at 105 kilometres per hour through a curve which had an 85 kilometre per hour advisory speed sign. In other words, his action in seeking ‘to cut the corner’ probably mislead the plaintiff. The plaintiff was undoubtedly partly responsible for the accident, in failing to keep a better lookout and observing that the defendant was not reducing his speed. On the other hand, the defendant had every opportunity to avoid the plaintiff, but took no evasive action until it was far too late. As the trial judge found, he must bear the bulk of the responsibility for the accident. The trial judge assessed their respective responsibilities at one-third and two-thirds, which are figures with which I would not interfere. 
     
      
    155 However, an understanding of the circumstances within which the accident occurred demonstrates, in my view, that whatever the faults of the design of the intersection, they did not materially contribute to the accident in any relevant sense. Both parties knew the intersection well; each knew it was a cross-intersection and that it had turn lanes; indeed, the only mistakes which were made related to the conduct of the other driver, based on common knowledge of the design features of the intersection. 
     
      
    156 The trial judge was criticised for dealing with the liability of the RTA in cursory terms, without giving due consideration to the evidence of the experts. For the reasons set out above, in my view his Honour came to the correct conclusion. The opinions of the experts were of little relevance in making that assessment. The conclusion was primarily based upon the particular circumstances of the accident and the errors on the part of the plaintiff and the defendant. Even if I held doubts as to his Honour’s assessment of these matters (which I do not) I would have been reluctant to interfere given that his Honour had a view of the intersection, and was able to make an assessment of the defendant, in particular in the witness box, which may have allowed him to form a view as to his explanations of his own conduct which may not be readily inferred from the somewhat surprising attitudes revealed by parts of the cross-examination. The appeal with respect to issues of liability should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Damages: 
      
    157 The first issue in relation to damages concerns the allowance by his Honour of expenses incurred by the plaintiff’s wife in travelling to Sydney and for accommodation in Sydney, whilst her husband was in hospital. As the trial judge noted, after the accident the plaintiff was airlifted to Port Macquarie Base Hospital and then transferred to St George Hospital where he remained from 12 March until 15 May 2001: Judgment, p 35. 
     
      
    158 The defendant’s complaint in relation to this amount is not that it was an illegitimate item of damage in accordance with general law principles, but that its recovery was precluded by s 83 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) (“the MAC Act”). It was said to constitute expenses for attendant care services, for the purposes of s 83(1)(d). 
     
      
    159 The relevance of s 83 in this regard is somewhat obscure. Chapter 5 of the MAC Act applies to awards of damages and s 123 states that a court cannot award damages to a person in respect of a motor accident “contrary to this Chapter”. Section 83 is not to be found in Chapter 5: it appears in Part 4.3 of Chapter 4. It is headed “Duty of insurer to make hospital, medical and other payments”. Chapter 4 generally deals with motor accident claims and how they are to be made, assessed and otherwise considered, prior to court proceedings. Section 83(1) reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        83 Duty of insurer to make hospital, medical and other payments 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) Once liability has been admitted (wholly or in part) or determined (wholly or in part) against the person against whom the claim is made, it is the duty of an insurer to make payments to or on behalf of the claimant in respect of: 
           
            
            (a) hospital, medical and pharmaceutical expenses, and  
             
            (b) rehabilitation expenses, and 
             
            (c) respite care expenses in respect of a claimant who is seriously injured and in need of constant care over a long term, and 
             
            (d) attendant care services expenses in respect of a claimant who is seriously injured and in need of constant care over a long term (being services provided by a person with appropriate training to provide those services, but not including services provided by a person who is related to the claimant or any services for which the claimant has not paid and is not liable to pay), 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            as incurred. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    160 The purpose and intent of this provision is reasonably clear: it imposes a duty on an insurer, in a case where liability has been admitted or determined, to meet certain expenses of a claimant, “as incurred”. It is in similar terms to s 45(2) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988 (NSW). Section 45(1) of the latter Act imposes a duty on an insurer to endeavour to resolve a claim as expeditiously as possible: the equivalent provision in the MAC Act is to be found in s 80(1). A payment made pursuant to s 83 “before the claimant obtains judgment for damages against the defendant”, is a defence to the proceedings to the extent of the amount so paid: see s 83(5). 
     
      
    161 If this provision is to operate in the sense contended for by the defendant, it must, by implication, impose a limit on the matters with respect to which damages can be awarded by a court. However, the structure of the Act is inconsistent with any such implication. Furthermore, Chapter 5 makes separate and different provision in relation to recovery of amounts for attendant care services. Thus, s 128 provides, in part: 
     
      
       
        
        128 Damages for economic loss – maximum amount for provision of certain attendant care services 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) Compensation, included in an award of damages, for the value of attendant care services: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) which have been or are to be provided by another person to the person in whose favour the award is made, and 
             
            (b) for which the person in whose favour the award is made has not paid and is not liable to pay, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            must not exceed the amount determined in accordance with this section. 
            
           
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) No compensation is to be awarded if the services are provided, or are to be provided: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) for less than 6 hours per week, and 
             
            (b) for less than 6 months. 
            
           
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (7) Except as provided by this section, nothing in this section affects any other law relating to the value of attendant care services. 
          
         
        
       
      
    162 The differences in language between this provision and s 83(1)(d) make it unlikely that the terms found in the latter provision are intended as an additional constraint on the award of such damages. On the other hand, s 129, dealing with respite care, is in very similar terms to s 83(1)(c), taken together with 83(2)(a), but the fact that the provision is repeated in Chapter 5 is again an indication that the constraints on awards of damages by courts are to be found solely in Chapter 5, and not by implication to be derived from other parts of the Act. 
     
      
    163 In these circumstances, it is not necessary to inquire whether the expenses incurred by the plaintiff’s wife were expenses for attendant care services, although the plaintiff argued that they were not. The term “attendant care services” is defined in s 3 of the MAC Act to mean “services that aim to provide assistance to people with everyday tasks, and includes (for example) personal assistance, nursing, home maintenance and domestic services”. The precise scope of this definition should remain for a case in which it needs to be determined. 
     
      
    164 Similarly, it is not necessary for present purposes to consider the scope and operation of Wilson v McLeay (1961) 106 CLR 523 (in which Taylor J allowed for the expenses of visits by parents to a daughter seriously ill in hospital, as an element of general damages) in the light of more recent cases, including Griffiths v Kerkemeyer (1977) 139 CLR 161 at 173-178 (Stephen J). This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
    165 The second question in relation to damages concerned the calculation of economic loss based, not on the plaintiff’s pre-accident earnings, but on evidence of earnings of two comparable workers operating as tree fallers. 
     
      
    166 His Honour’s calculation of economic loss was based on the average weekly earnings of the comparable workers, being $893 per week net. This figure was adopted for the period from the date of the accident, 12 March 2001, until 30 June 2004. The agreed figure for the plaintiff’s income at the date of the accident was $798 per week net. 
     
      
    167 Prior to the accident, the plaintiff was working for Bartlett Haulage Co Pty Ltd on a piecework basis. He was employed as a log faller felling timber with a chainsaw. Various payment records indicated that the plaintiff was paid in accordance with a federal timber industry award and that the amounts calculated by reference to the timber cut varied quite significantly, as it would appear, between $3.15 and $4 per tonne. An item entitled “Koppers” was at a different rate of $9 but that may have been a rate per metre rather than a rate per tonne. There may have been some variation dependent upon the forest in which timber was being felled. A second variable was no doubt the hours worked, but the plaintiff’s wife gave evidence that he worked from early morning until dark.  
     
      
    168 Although the evidence is not precise, it appears that Bartlett Haulage went out of operation during 2002 and that its business and employees were taken over by a company known as Haulers and Fallers Pty Ltd, of which Ms Christine Hoffman was a director. She knew the plaintiff, and described him as “a very experienced and very good worker in the timber industry. He was a really good manual faller”: Tcpt, 5 May 2005, p 45. She gave evidence that someone with his experience was highly sought after in the industry and that her company would have taken him on when they took over the timber falling aspect of Bartlett Haulage in 2002. It was her view that the plaintiff would have been earning the same money as the two comparable fallers whose group certificates for the financial year ending 30 June 2004 she produced and which were relied on by the trial judge. 
     
      
    169 No date was given for the changeover from Bartlett Haulage to Ms Hoffman’s business, but in broad terms it may be reasonable to assume that the plaintiff would have continued to work for Bartlett Haulage for a year after the accident. The difference in earnings may also have been partly accounted for by inflation over the ensuing two years.  
     
      
    170 Accepting that the figures adopted in calculating loss of earning capacity cannot be refined with too much precision, it would nevertheless have been appropriate, in my view, for the trial judge to have adopted the earning rate disclosed for the plaintiff immediately prior to the accident as the rate which would have continued until his change of employment. This would involve a reduction of the award of approximately $5,000. Given that total damages were in excess of $1.3 million, this is a trivial variation of less than 0.5%. To interfere on this basis would imply that the calculation of damages has a degree of precision which, speaking generally, is not remotely approached. I would not interfere with the assessment undertaken by the trial judge. 
     
      
       
      Costs order in relation to RTA 
      
    171 It is somewhat regrettable that neither of the parties reduced the orders proposed by his Honour in his reasons into written form. I infer that, had that been done, the orders would have been along the following lines: 
     
      
       
      1. Judgment for the plaintiff against the first defendant in the amount of $871,019.50. 
       
       
      2. Dismiss the plaintiff’s claim against the second defendant (the RTA). 
       
       
      3. Dismiss the defendant’s cross-claim against the RTA. 
       
      
    172 His Honour appears to have ordered that, subject to one qualification, costs should follow the event. That would have required that the RTA’s costs would need to be divided between its resistance to the plaintiff’s claim and its resistance to the cross-claim for contribution filed by the defendant. The qualification to the general order was achieved by ordering the defendant to pay the RTA’s costs for which the plaintiff was liable. That appeared in a subsequent judgment by his Honour, following further written submissions, given in chambers on 1 May 2006, in which his Honour held: 
     
      
       
        
        “In those circumstances I conclude that a  
        Bullock 
         order should be made in favour of the plaintiff against the first defendant in respect of the costs of the second defendant. Otherwise costs to follow the event.” 
        
       
      
    173 The defendant challenges this order. He says, in effect, that the conditions for transferring the plaintiff’s liability in relation to the costs of the successful defendant to the unsuccessful defendant were not made out. 
     
      
    174 The reasons given by his Honour for the order were in substance that: 
     
      
       
      (1) it was the defendant who joined the RTA by way of cross-claim for contribution; 
       
       
      (2) the plaintiff’s amended statement of claim merely reflected the same allegations against the RTA and was a reasonable step for the plaintiff to take in the circumstances; 
       
       
      (3) the refusal of the defendant to give a statement to the police left the plaintiff, who had no memory of the circumstances prior to the accident, “very much in the dark as to what had caused the accident”; 
       
       
      (4) the strength of the plaintiff’s case against the defendant did not fully appear until the defendant had been cross-examined; 
       
       
      (5) there was a reasonable case of neglect of duty on the part of the RTA, which ultimately failed because it was not causative of the accident. 
       
      
    175 In addition to these considerations, the plaintiff sought to rely on correspondence in the course of which, shortly prior to the hearing, it had sought to withdraw its claim against the RTA on the basis that each party bore his or its own costs, an offer which fell through, because the RTA was not willing to accept unless the defendant also withdrew his claim against the RTA. Accordingly, the plaintiff argued, it was the defendant’s conduct, not only in commencing proceedings against the RTA, but in refusing to settle them, which led to the plaintiff continuing against the RTA. 
     
      
    176 The relevant principles to be applied in determining this question may be derived from the well-known statement in the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Gould v Vaggelas (1983-85) 157 CLR 215 at 229-230, referring in turn to Sanderson v Blyth Theatre Co [1903] 2 KB 533 at 539; see also Sved v Council of the Municipality of Woollahra (1998) NSW Conv R 55-842 at 56, 605 (Giles J) relied on in Almeida v Universal Dye Works Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2001] NSWCA 156 at [7]-[8] (Priestley JA) and at [32]-[39] (Santow AJA) and see Herning v GWS Machinery Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 263 at [40]-[41] and Herning v GWS Machinery Pty Ltd [No. 2] [2005] NSWCA 375 at [2]. 
     
      
    177 Because the defendant must bear the costs of the unsuccessful cross-claim, the question is in reality whether it should bear the whole of the costs of the RTA, or only part thereof. As noted above, the primary expert evidence in support of the view that the RTA bore at least part of the responsibility for the accident was that led from Mr Stuart-Smith, a consulting traffic engineer called by the defendant. The defendant also obtained the report from Mr Michael Griffiths of Road Safety Solutions. It is clear from the supplementary report of Mr Kiernan for the RTA, dated 7 April 2004, that the RTA was primarily concerned to rebut the evidence of Mr Stuart-Smith. Although Mr Kiernan provided a second supplementary report addressed to the report of Mr Johnston, called on behalf of the plaintiff, as noted above, Mr Johnston did not sheet home responsibility for the accident to the RTA. Accordingly, the substance of the case against the RTA was provided by the defendant and the primary issue addressed by Mr Kiernan was the road design faults identified by Mr Stuart-Smith for the defendant. The cross-examination of Mr Kiernan by counsel for the plaintiff covered 1.5 pages of transcript, whereas the cross-examination on behalf of the defendant covered almost 50 pages. 
     
      
    178 The bulk of the costs incurred by the RTA were therefore in response to the defendant and he should bear those costs as a result of failing in his cross-claim. As between it and the plaintiff, it is fair that, because of the other factors noted above, it should bear the remaining small proportion of the RTA’s costs which would otherwise have fallen to be paid by the plaintiff, because of the failure of his claim against the RTA. To avoid complexity in accounting, it would be preferable to make an order that the defendant pay directly the RTA’s costs of the trial. 
     
      
       
      Costs of appeal 
      
    179 The defendant (Appellant) has been entirely unsuccessful in its appeal: accordingly, it should pay both the plaintiff’s and the RTA’s costs of the appeal. 
     
      
    180 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Subject to the variation with respect to the costs order noted below, dismiss the appeal. 
       
       
      2. Vary the costs order made by the trial judge so that it provides: 
       
       
        
        (a) the defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs of the trial other than the plaintiff’s costs as against the RTA; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the defendant pay the RTA’s costs of the trial being those incurred as against the plaintiff and in relation to the cross-claim brought by the defendant. 
        
       
       
      3. The Appellant pay the costs of the First and Second Respondents of the appeal.

      2006/646 REGINA v HELENA JANE ROWE 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 23 October 2006 the offender was arraigned before a jury on a charge of murdering her son, an infant aged 7 months. The child died on 16 January 2004 as a result of the ingestion of methadone. The offender pleaded not guilty and was subsequently convicted by the jury of manslaughter. It now falls to this Court to sentence her for this crime, the maximum penalty for which is 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The offender was a long-term drug addict who had been taking methadone for some time before conceiving the child. The child was born methadone-dependent on 20 July 2004. He remained in hospital, being treated for his drug dependency, for six weeks until 31 August. The offender and her child then lived in a unit at Kingswood. They were supported by numerous agencies in the community including the Department of Community Services (DOCS) and the Probation and Parole Service. The offender was receiving methadone under a programme run by the Gateway Clinic. 
     
      
    3 The offender was in a relationship with the child’s father, Brendon Galwey, who resided in a unit at Mortdale. On occasions Mr Galwey would visit the offender in Kingswood and sometimes stay the night. The relationship however was a stormy one but it seems that the father was as loving to the child as was the offender. Mr Galway was addicted to amphetamine and on occasions the offender would use this drug in his company after the birth of the child. 
     
      
    4 The offender was unreliable in attendance at the Gateway Clinic and on occasions was refused methadone for various reasons. She would then purchase the drug from a source she had in the community. Therefore, at times she had methadone available in the unit. On at least two occasions the offender had been given information about the drug methadone and the dangers of its misuse when enrolling in methadone programmes. 
     
      
    5 There was a large amount of evidence placed before the jury as to the offender’s care of the child. Generally she was coping well although there were examples of insufficient concern for the child’s safety. For example, there was evidence of her driving a motor vehicle with the child lying unprotected in the well of the front passenger’s side of the vehicle. She delayed having the child immunised. There was also evidence of her leaving the child in the care of an acquaintance and failing to return when expected. However, there was no evidence of the offender ever mistreating the child and to the best of her ability she was a caring and loving mother. 
     
      
    6 Unfortunately the child was difficult to settle, probably as a result of his earlier drug dependency. There was evidence from neighbours of the child crying for lengthy periods of time during the day and night and occasionally the offender yelling for him to stop. The offender had mentioned to members of DOCS that she was having difficulty coping with the child and getting sufficient sleep. Over the period leading up to the child’s death the offender fell out with one of her best friends and supporters. The relationship with the child’s father became more difficult because she believed he was not doing enough to assist her. He was manipulative of the offender and saw her and the child largely when it suited him. 
     
      
    7 Much of the evidence about the days leading to the death of the child came from Mr Galwey. He had for a period after the death of the child lived with the offender in his unit. It is clear that his parents were not supportive of the relationship. Eventually, as the police investigation proceeded, Mr Galwey asked her to leave. He was a most unreliable witness and has given many inconsistent versions to the police and in evidence at the committal. Unless supported by other evidence, his account could not be relied upon to any degree. This was perhaps due in measure to his frequent use of amphetamine, he was unwell at the time of the trial, and to self-interest. However, I do not believe that he was trying to give false accounts intentionally to prejudice the offender. There was no suggestion in his evidence of her in anyway mistreating the child rather his evidence was supportive of her so far as her general relationship with the child was concerned. There was a suggestion that he might have given the child the methadone from which he died, but I do not believe this is a reasonable possibility for reasons I shall give later. 
     
      
    8 Nor was the offender a particularly reliable witness. She did not give evidence at the trial but had engaged in a lengthy formal interview with police. She had also participated in a videoed interview in a police vehicle retracing her steps on the night the child died and later back at the unit. She told at least one lie in her account of the circumstances leading up to the child’s death: she said that she was driven to premises where she sought help for the child when it was clear that she was the driver. This may have been because she was concerned about driving a motor vehicle without a licence, but she persisted in the lie and embellished it in a way that destroys her general credit. She denied giving any illegal drugs to the child but I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she did. 
     
      
    9 It is not clear what occurred on 16 January, the day of the child’s death. This is chiefly because the persons who can give evidence about that day are the offender and Mr Galwey and I have noted their unreliability. On the morning of 16 January the offender attended at the Gateway Clinic and was administered methadone that she ingested on the premises. Thereafter her movements are unclear. Mr Galwey has given various conflicting accounts of his movements on that day and the condition of the child at various times during the day. 
     
      
    10 However it seems to me that the following is probably what occurred. At about 3pm, Mr Galwey went to the offender’s unit, but she was not home. She returned about half an hour later. The child immediately appeared unwell to Mr Galwey, being lethargic and hot, and he suggested to the offender that he needed medical attention. The offender stated that the child was simply overheated, it being a very hot day. She refused to take the child to hospital even though it was a very short distance from the unit. 
     
      
    11 In an attempt to lower the child’s temperature, the offender administered to him some Panadol and a naturopathic medication called Infants’ Friend. She removed his clothes and positioned a fan to circulate air over his body. Mr Galwey continued to insist that the child be taken to hospital, but the offender continued to refuse to do so. At about this time a neighbour overheard an argument between Mr Galwey and the offender about taking the child to hospital. At some time after 3.30 pm she left the child in Mr Galwey’s care at the unit while she tried to purchase some drugs for Mr Galwey. 
     
      
    12 Approximately 20 minutes after she left the unit, Mr Galwey telephoned her and insisted that she return, as he was concerned about the child’s health. The offender returned to the unit 15 to 20 minutes later. At 6.40pm the offender telephoned an acquaintance, Michelle Sava, who resided in the suburb of Londonderry. She said that she was going to visit her to deliver some Christmas presents for Ms Sava’s children. The offender asked if Ms Sava knew anyone who could sell her some ‘speed’. Ms Sava said she could not help her. 
     
      
    13 Later that evening the offender visited the residence of Jacqueline Conroy, a friend who resided in the Blacktown area. She asked Ms Conroy to baby-sit the child while she attempted to obtain drugs. Ms Conroy declined but saw that the child, who was in the vehicle, appeared unwell. She thought that he should be taken to hospital. 
     
      
    14 At 8.15pm the offender again called Ms Sava indicating that she had become lost in the Londonderry area. Ordinarily the trip from the unit at Kingswood to Londonderry would have taken about 20 minutes but the offender took well in excess of this time to travel that distance. Shortly before 8.30pm, she arrived at the home of Ms Sava. When the child was brought inside the house, it was immediately apparent to both Ms Sava and her partner that he was gravely ill. They insisted on calling an ambulance but the offender said that she would take the child to hospital herself. At this stage it appeared that the child had stopped breathing and Ms Sava formed the view that he was deceased. 
     
      
    15 Shortly after 8.30pm Ms Sava called triple 0. The operator gave instructions for CPR to Ms Sava who in turn relayed them to the offender. At 8.46pm an ambulance arrived but the child was not exhibiting any signs of life. The ambulance officers attempted to resuscitate him and continued to do so until arriving at hospital. Before leaving Ms Sava, the offender asked her to say that a female had driven her to her home. The offender then followed the ambulance. The child failed to respond to the resuscitation attempts and was pronounced dead at the Nepean hospital at 9.44pm. 
     
      
    16 Later toxicology examination of the child’s blood and urine indicated that methadone, methamphetamine and paracetamol were present in his blood at the time of death. His urine contained traces of a number of drugs including, amphetamine, methadone, methamphetamine, oxazepam, pseudoephedrine and temazepan. Some of these drugs would have been the breakdown of other substances, so for example the amphetamine and pseudoephedrine were probably related to the methamphetamine. Dr Hulewicz, who carried out the post mortem examination, determined that the cause of death was “methadone and benzodiazepine toxicity with methamphetamine a possible contributory factor”. Dr Judith Perl was of the view that the principal cause of death was methadone toxicity. It was the Crown case that the offender had given the child a small amount of methadone to assist him to settle and sleep. 
     
      
    17 The jury’s finding that the offender was guilty of manslaughter could have been based upon one of two findings. The jury could have determined that the offender caused the child’s death by the commission of an unlawful and dangerous act, that is giving the child methadone. Alternatively they could have found that the offender caused the child’s death by gross criminal negligence, in that knowing that her son had been given methadone, presumably by Mr Galwey, she did not seek timely medical assistance for him. I have no doubt that I should sentence her on the former basis. 
     
      
    18 The Crown case that the offender gave the child methadone was in my view overwhelming. The Crown asserted to the jury that she was the only person with opportunity and motive to do so. It is highly likely that the methamphetamine in the child was not given to him intentionally but was the residue in a container or on a spoon used to administer the methadone to the child. Other drugs found in the child were drugs chiefly used by the offender and are consistent with her administering those drugs as well as the methadone in an attempt to settle him. Mr Galwey in my view had no motive to give the child methadone. It was not his drug of choice. But in any event he had relatively little on-going contact with the child. He seemed more interested in playing an electronic game than in the child when he was at the unit. I doubt that he had been too disturbed by the child’s restlessness as he was not with him long enough. 
     
      
    19 Yet the offender was having difficulty coping in the period immediately before the child’s death and a principal reason was that the child’s constant crying was preventing her from getting sufficient sleep. Methadone was a drug used by her and she had it in the unit. Although Mr Galwey may have had the opportunity to give the child the drug on the morning of 16 January that seems to be inconsistent with the child being so ill at 3.30pm that Mr Galwey was insisting that he be taken to hospital in a conversation overheard by a neighbour. Mr Galwey’s insistence that the child receive medical assistance seems inconsistent with him having caused his illness. It is not clear how long before the child’s death he was given the drug, but it seems to be most likely that it was on the day before his death. If that is so Mr Galwey had no opportunity to do it. The other drugs found in the child’s body must have been administered many hours before the child’s death when Mr Galwey could not have done so. It is highly unlikely in my opinion that the offender gave the child those drugs but Mr Galwey gave him methadone. 
     
      
    20 Further, as part of the lies told to the police concerning the fictitious person who had driven her and the child to the home of Ms Sava, the offender told police that this person had a child. She suggested that the child might have given something to the child. This was in my view a lie told because she knew that she had given the child the substance that might have killed him and she was attempting to shift the blame. 
     
      
    21 The refusal of the offender to seek medical assistance for the child may be explained by her lack of confidence in the medical profession but it is also consistent with her fear of losing the child if she was found to have mistreated him by administering drugs to him. She was also vehemently opposed to a post mortem examination being carried out on the child suggesting a consciousness of guilt in relation to what she had done. I am satisfied that the only reasonable explanation for all of the evidence is that the offender gave the child methadone in an attempt to settle him when driven to desperation by his insistent crying and her inability to obtain the sleep she required. 
     
      
    22 The offence is clearly a serious one. The child was in the offender’s care and so young that any use of drugs carried with it a very significant risk of grave injury to him. The offender must have known that fact but I am prepared to accept that she thought that the relatively small dose given to him would assist him to settle and was driven to this course because of the numerous stressors under which she suffered in the days leading up to the death. She was generally unsuited to care for the child because of her use of drugs apart from methadone from time to time. In hindsight it should have been apparent to those with care and control of the offender and the child that he was at risk due to the offender’s drug taking. She received little real support from her mother, who unfortunately added to her problems by her attitude to the DOCS officers. I have already commented on the loss of a supporting friendship and difficulties in the relationship with the child’s father shortly before the child’s death. 
     
      
    23 Some of her behaviour might suggest that she had little real regard for the child but that is not true. At times she lived with a sense of unreality no doubt cause by her drug usage. She simply was not conscious that her behaviour or conduct might harm the child. I do not believe that she was aware of the risks that she sometimes took with his wellbeing. To some extent I think her refusal to take the child to hospital rather than to seek the assistance of Ms Sava was a lack of realisation of the serious plight of the child. Even when the ambulance officers were trying to resuscitate the child, the offender was speaking of her concerns that DOCS would take him, rather than an acceptance that he was unlikely to survive. Her wish to have a cigarette when she should have been attempting resuscitation herself was part of the same failure to appreciate the reality of the situation that she faced. 
     
      
    24 There is no doubt that the offender has suffered grievously over the death of her son. Some of her behaviour, if taken out of context, might indicate a degree of callousness, such as the cigarette incident and asking Ms Sava to lie about who was driving the motor vehicle at the very time the child was being rushed to hospital. But the evidence is all one way that she loved the child and was distraught at his death. It is difficult to find that there is any contrition for causing his death because she does not accept that she did. But it seems to me to be a situation where lack of contrition does not have any real relevance to sentencing. It may simply be the case that she cannot accept the fact that she was responsible. 
     
      
    25 The offender is aged 26 years. She has a criminal record dating from 1997 for offences of dishonesty and drug offences. She was placed on good behaviour bonds in 2003 with a condition for drug rehabilitation for various dishonest and drug offences. She was sentenced to imprisonment in 2004 for similar offences and was released to parole in July 2004. 
     
      
    26 There is a psychological report in evidence. It indicates that the offender believes that she was hyperactive as a youth and her mother could not cope bringing her up. She was made a State Ward as being “uncontrollable”. She spent times with foster families and in an institution until being returned to her mother at the age of 15. She soon entered into a relationship and was introduced to drugs. That relationship concluded and she married another person in March 2003. They separated a short time later. She then entered into a relationship with Mr Galwey. She fell pregnant in October 2003 and Mr Galwey wanted her to have a termination. She refused and they separated. She then went into custody and was released shortly before the child was born. 
     
      
    27 There are conflicting views about the offender’s relationship with and treatment by her mother throughout her life. There is some suggestion that her mother may have suffered from a personality disorder and mistreated her but the offender does not accept that this was so. Yet it is clear that her early life was disturbed and disrupted as a result of her involvement with DOCS whatever be the cause. However, she has a strong attachment and commitment to her mother, who is in ill health, and the offender hopes to live with her when she is released. 
     
      
    28 The psychologist found that the offender was suffering anxiety and major depression over the death of her child, then being charged and ultimately incarcerated. She has a dependent personality that accounts for her relationships with her mother and Mr Galwey. There is some suggestion that she may have been suffering from Post Natal Depression. She expressed the view to the psychologist that various agencies were “harassing her” at the same time she was trying to cope with her relationship with the child’s father and her fears of failing as a mother. Many of the deleterious aspects of her personality can be addressed by specific counselling and personality development programmes. 
     
      
    29 There was a letter from the chaplain at the Mulawa Correctional Centre tendered. She has visited the offender a number of times and has spoken with her about her problems. She feels that the offender has over time gained insights that will assist her when she is released into the community. 
     
      
    30 The offender gave evidence before me. She has been a protected inmate while on remand for a period of 21 months. At one time she was a limited association inmate that meant she was confined in her cell for nearly the entire day. She spent 14 months in this type of custody. Her present custody seems to be not very different from the general prison population except that the prisoners in her classification tend to get locked down more often because of the lack of staff and there are less opportunities and amenities. She has worked in custody when she can and has been a sweeper and presently covers books. She has reduced her methadone intake over the period on remand so that she was no longer receiving methadone about 3 weeks before the sentencing hearing on 1 February this year. She has received drug and alcohol counselling. The offender has spoken to a psychiatrist while in custody and has been taking an antidepressant. She hopes to undertake further education when released and eventually find some form of employment. 
     
      
    31 It seems to me that there is a need for the sentence to include an aspect of general deterrence in respect of other persons who may resort to illegal drugs or other noxious substances in order to gain temporary relief from a difficult child. Dr Perl gave evidence that it was not unusual for a person to give methadone to a child to calm it. However, there is in my opinion no call for specific deterrence. It is a matter for the offender what she does about drug use in the future. Clearly it is unlikely that she will find herself in a similar situation to that in which she found herself at the time of the child’s death. In any event the loss of the child and her consequential grief will do more to restrain her from any similar conduct in the future than any sentence I might impose upon her. 
     
      
    32 As with all manslaughters the sentence must reflect the fact that a life has been taken by the offender’s conduct. Here the conduct was purposeful and intentional although of course she did not foresee the death of her child as a result. That would have been the last thing that she wanted or imagined. It was an act arising out of a period of stress on a person who was quite unable to cope with it and the added responsibility and care of a difficult child. There is no history of abuse of the child, although of course he was very young and had not been long in the offender’s sole custody. 
     
      
    33 It is difficult to find a range of sentences for manslaughter of this type as it is a relatively infrequent occurrence: see R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184. There was no violence here and no anger. Rather the offender did an act that was intended to give the child some comfort as well as some relief for herself. That is an unusual circumstance and reduces the culpability of the offender. A case of some similarity is R v Blakeney (NSWCCA, unreported, 15 December 1994) but that was worst factually because of the extended period of abuse of the child. However that accused pleaded guilty to an offence not involving the death of the child and so the offence here, encompassing as it does the child’s death is more serious. The sentence in that case was 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 3 months. In R v Marshall [2003] NSWSC 448 a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months was imposed for the manslaughter of a 9 months old child by shaking. There was no history of abuse and the offence was committed in momentary anger and without thinking. The accused had a stronger subjective case than does the offender. 
     
      
    34 There are special circumstances relating to continual assistance for the offender in relation to drug dependency and more fundamental personality issues that no doubt have been responsible for her use of drugs over a long period of her life. Although she has had bonds with conditions for drug counselling in the past, there may now be a commitment that has not existed before given the tragedy she has suffered principally because of her use of illegal drugs. 
     
      
    35 I have reduced the sentence and the non-parole period by about six months because of the period on remand she served in harsher conditions and I have generally taken into account that she will probably serve the whole of the period of her sentence on protection with some loss of amenities. The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months. The sentence is to commence on 5 May 2005 and the offender is eligible to be released to parole on 4 May 2008.

    JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: As to the sentencing of Jennifer Mary Milich.1 The offender is Jennifer Mary Milich. She was born on 4 February 1962. Accordingly, she was aged forty-three years five months when she committed the subject offence, to which I will refer in due course, and she is aged forty-five years two months now.2 The offender is the eldest of her parent's five children. Her father died about fifteen years ago when he was aged fifty-eight years, as a result of lung cancer. Her mother, who is aged sixty-four years, is alive. Notwithstanding some difficulty in her relationship with her mother, she and her mother are attempting to mend their relationship and her mother is supportive of her. I do not see any relationship between her background and her commission of the subject offence.3 The offender’s upbringing was less than perfect. Her upbringing is described in the report (exhibit 9) of Mr Borenstein, psychologist, and need not be recited. I do not see any relationship between her upbringing and her commission of the subject offence.4 The offender attended Wodonga West Primary School from kindergarten to Year 6, and Wodonga High School from Year 7 to Year 10, leaving high school at the end of 1978. She commenced Year 11 at Wodonga Technical College but she did not complete the year.5 After ceasing to attend Wodonga Technical College, the offender commenced employment with the Australian Taxation Office and she had that employment until 1997. During 1995 she was seconded to the Commonwealth Employment Service. As a result of this secondment, she suffered a nervous breakdown and was unable to continue her employment. She accepted voluntary redundancy in 1997. She has held some casual employments, some paid, most unpaid, since 1997. She was placed on a disability pension in 2001.6 The offender met her future husband shortly after she commenced employment with the Australian Taxation Office. She kept company with him for four or five years before they married when she was aged twenty-one years. They are the parents of two children, a daughter aged twenty-one years and a son aged sixteen years. She suffered post- natal depression following the births of her daughter and her son, and took anti depressant medication for twelve months after the birth of her daughter and for one month after the birth of her son. Unfortunately, her marriage started to unravel when she suffered the nervous breakdown and she and her husband separated during 1997. After her separation from her husband, her children continued to live with her husband. Now her daughter lives in Melbourne and is self supporting, and her son lives with her former husband in Wodonga and he is in Year 11 at Wodonga High School. She has a good relationship with both her children.7 The offender enjoys good physical health, albeit that she is overweight and that she smokes cigarettes. However, she does not enjoy good mental health. She is anxious and depressed, for which she takes anti depressant medication. I suspect that her pre offence state of depression has been exacerbated by her present situation. I do not see any relationship between her depression and her commission of the subject offence.8 The offender has not abused intoxicating liquor or any prohibited drug, although occasionally she has smoked cannabis.9 The offender had an unblemished character before her commission of the subject offence. Moreover, she was well liked and well respected by those who knew her. I find it difficult to understand why she committed the subject offence and, without that understanding, I accept that she was besotted by her co-offender who used the name of Thomas.10 The circumstances in which the offender committed the subject offence are as follows.11 During 2002 the offender “met”, if that is the correct word, a man who, as I have said, called himself Thomas, on an internet “chat line”. About two weeks after this “meeting”, Thomas travelled from Sydney to Albury for a face to face meeting with the offender. Thomas was a Nigerian national by birth and, he claimed, an Australian citizen by naturalisation. The offender and Thomas commenced a relationship, in which they “talked” on the “chat line” and met in Albury where the offender lived, or in Strathfield where Thomas lived “a couple of times a year”.12 Some time during 2004, Thomas asked the offender to “help him out” by receiving “packages”, which, she claimed, he said “contained documents”, which, she claimed, she believed were to be used to “help Africans to have a better life in Australia”.13 Consequently, during 2004 and early 2005, three packages arrived at the offender’s home and one package arrived at the offender’s neighbour’s home, of which the offender was caring, which package was collected by the offender, and, of these four packages, two were collected by Thomas from the offender at her home at Albury and two were forwarded by the offender to addresses nominated by Thomas.14 On 3 July 2005 a package addressed to “Kylie Fox”, a name used by the offender, arrived in Australia from Brazil. This package was opened and its contents were found to be 408.1 grams gross, 296.9 grams net of cocaine. The cocaine was removed from the package and replaced with another powder and the package was re-assembled to appear as if it had not been opened, to be delivered by an Australian Federal Police officer posing as an Australia Post officer, to the addressee, that is Kylie Fox.15 Between 3 July 2005 and 13 July 2005 a number of email transmissions passed between the offender posing as Kylie Fox, and UPS and Ms K Edelman of UPS related to the movement of the package in the UPS system.16 On 8 July 2005 a man who used the name “M Badah”, and who probably was Thomas, arranged with Ms J Barlow of Albury Wodonga Apartments to rent premises at 534 Young Street in Albury for the period from 8 July 2005 to 14 July 2005.17 On the morning of 13 July 2005 the offender placed a note on the front door of premises at 534 Young Street in Albury, for the Australia Post officer, related to the delivery of the package.18 At about 1.30 pm on 13 July 2005 Federal Agent Ian Perisa, posing as an Australia Post officer, attended the premises at 534 Young Street in Albury to deliver the reassembled package containing the substituted powder. He found the premises to be unoccupied and he placed an Australia Post “postal item to be collected” card on the front door of the premises alongside the note placed on the door earlier that day by the offender.19 At about 2.25 pm on 13 July 2005 Federal Agent Perisa returned to the premises at 534 Young Street in Albury and he spoke there with the offender and he handed over the reassembled package to her, for which she signed.20 The offender took the package into the premises at 534 Young Street in Albury and, after removing the shipping labels with a pair of scissors, she left the premises, taking the note that she had placed on the front door, the card that Federal Agent Perisa had placed on the front door and the shipping labels that she had removed from the package with her, but leaving the package and the pair of scissors inside the premises.21 At about 2.30 pm on 13 July 2005 the offender left the premises at 534 Young Street in Albury and she entered her car and drove it into the shopping centre of Albury at where, after she had parked her car, she was arrested by Federal Agent S King. Her note, the Australia Post card, the shipping labels and other personal documents were found inside her car and they were seized by Federal Agent King.22 At about 2.56 pm on 13 July 2005 Federal Agent Perisa returned to the premises at 534 Young Street in Albury and, after entering the premises, he found the reassembled package and the pair of scissors lying on top of it. The package and the pair of scissors were seized by Federal Agent Perisa.23 After being arrested, the offender was taken to Albury Police Station, at where between 2.50 pm and 4.26 pm, she was interviewed by Federal Agent A Nolan. During this interview, the offender told Federal Agent Nolan the “story” that she and Thomas had concocted to tell if asked questions about the package.24 After being interviewed, the offender was charged with the subject offence, that of attempting to possess goods that had been imported into Australia which were prohibited goods, namely cocaine, contrary to section 233B subsection 1 of the Customs Act, and, after being charged, she was refused bail and remanded in custody.25 On 18 July 2005 the offender appeared before a Magistrate in the Local Court at Albury on an application for bail, and she was granted conditional bail.26 On 21 July 2005 the offender was released from prison on conditional bail. She had spent nine days in prison between her arrest on 13 July 2005 and her release on bail on 21 July 2005.27 On 10 February 2006 the offender appeared before a Magistrate in the Local Court at Albury for a committal hearing. The solicitor representing the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the solicitor representing the offender, had agreed that a witness, a Mr C Towers, of the Australian Federal Police, was to be examined and cross examined on his examination of data recovered from the offender’s computer. After this was done, the offender was committed to appear in this Court in Albury on a date to be fixed for her trial.28 On 18 October 2006 the offender appeared before me in the Court in Albury to stand her trial. The Crown Prosecutor presented an indictment which charged the offender with attempting on about 13 July 2005, to possess goods that had been imported into Australia, which were prohibited goods, namely a quantity of cocaine, being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to cocaine, contrary to section 233B subsection 1 of the Customs Act. The offender pleaded not guilty to the charge. A jury was empanelled. The jury heard evidence from seven witnesses, including the offender, and it received 25 exhibits, 21 presented by the Crown Prosecutor and four presented by the offender’s counsel, over the first three days, counsel’s addresses and my summing up over the fourth day and it returned its verdict of guilty on the fifth day of the trial. After taking the jury’s verdict, I remanded the offender in prison bail refused pending sentencing.29 On 25 January 2007 the offender appeared before me in the Court in the Downing Centre in Sydney on the sentencing proceedings. After receiving documentary material from the Crown Prosecutor and the offender’s counsel, and after hearing evidence from the offender and submissions as to sentence from counsel, I stood over the sentencing of the offender to 4 April 2007.30 Today, 5 April 2007, the offender has appeared before me in the Court at Gosford for sentence.31 The offence committed by the offender is, as I have said already, an offence contrary to section 233B of the Customs Act, for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of twenty-five years or a fine of a maximum of $550,000 or both.32 It is beyond argument that the offence is a very serious one. The prescribed penalty is an indication of the seriousness with which Parliament, representing the will of the community, regards the offence. It is an offence for which the only appropriate sentence, except perhaps in very exceptional circumstances, is one of imprisonment to be served on a full time basis.33 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the offender’s role in the importation of the cocaine was greater than that of a courier, whereas the offender’s counsel submitted that, however the offender’s role is described, it was at the bottom of the ladder of the hierarchy of drug importation. I agree with the Crown Prosecutor. I consider, having regard to the content of her email transmissions and to what she did, that the offender was more involved in the importation of the cocaine than a courier, with her involvement being determined by what she did.34 Although the evidence does not allow me to say what the offender was to receive for her participation in the importation of the cocaine, I suspect that her reward would have been greater than the amounts of money that she received from Thomas.35 The offender’s counsel submitted that, although she did not plead guilty, the offender assisted in the speedy trial by admitting many facts thereby saving some time in costs, for which she is entitled to a discount in penalty. I agree with this submission. The course taken by the offender was a sensible one, which considerably reduced the length of the trial thereby saving time and costs.36 The offender’s counsel submitted that the onerous conditions of the offender’s bail greatly restricted her movements and life style between 21 July 2005 when she was released from prison on bail and 18 October 2006 when she appeared before me to stand her trial, for which she is entitled to a discount in penalty. I agree with this submission. Although the offender’s movements and lifestyle were not as restricted on bail as they would have been had she been in prison, she is entitled to have the onerous conditions of her bail taken into account in her favour in the determination of an appropriate sentence.37 The offender’s counsel submitted that the offender has learned a salutary lesson from doing what she did and that, having regard to her past and what she has done in prison, she has excellent prospects for rehabilitation and she is unlikely to re-offend. I agree with this submission. The offender had a previously unblemished character. She has made good use of her time in prison. She has her family support. I accept that she has excellent prospects for rehabilitation and that she is unlikely to re-offend.38 One matter which must not be overlooked or undervalued is deterrence. Although personal deterrence is not as important in this case as it might be in another case, because, as I have said, I think that the offender is unlikely to re-offend, general deterrence is important. People who import prohibited drugs, whatever be the drug, whatever be the amount of the drug, and whatever be the method of importation, must be made aware by sentences imposed upon people caught importing prohibited drugs that a prison sentence is the consequence of being caught, and must thereby be deterred from importing drugs.39 What, then, having regard to what I have said about the offence and the offender, is an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for the offence of which the jury found her to be guilty?40 The Crown Prosecutor drew my attention to R v Wong and Leung (1999) NSWCCA 420, R v Mas Rividavia (2004) NSWCCA 284, and R v Paliwala (2005) NSWCCA 221, amongst others, and the offender’s counsel drew my attention to R v Haidar (2004) NSWCCA 350. There are many decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to appeals from sentences imposed on offenders who import prohibited drugs into Australia. Often each decision turns on its particular facts. However, having said that, I have considered the underlying principles stated in the decisions to which I have been referred.41 Balancing as best I can what I have said about the offence and the offender, I have determined that the appropriate sentence is imprisonment for ten years, with a non-parole period of six years and a parole period of four years. The sentence will commence nine days before 23 October 2006, that is on 14 October 2006.42 Accordingly, Jennifer Mary Milich for the offence of attempting to possess a quantity of cocaine imported into Australia, contrary to the Customs Act, of which the jury found you to be guilty, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for ten years. I fix a non-parole period of six years, from 14 October 2006 to 13 October 2012, and a parole period of four years, from 14 October 2012 to 13 October 2016. I order that you be subject to supervision whilst on parole during the parole period by the Probation and Parole Service. I order that if not already destroyed, the drug be destroyed. You may return Miss Milich to custody.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Bethany Gill appears for sentence today. She has pleaded guilty on an earlier occasion to two counts on an indictment, one of assaulting Mr James Owens thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm and one of breaking and entering Mr Owen’s home and committing a serious indictable offence namely, assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Mr Owens. Those two offences were related to separate acts of violence committed about an hour apart. 2 In addition, Ms Gill ask that I take into account an offence of malicious damage, and finally there are related charges of contravening an apprehended violence order, one relating to each of the occasions that form the basis of the two counts on the indictment. 3 The offences were a gross overreaction to an argument that Ms Gill had with Mr Owens. It is apparent from the psychiatric report provided by Dr Westmore that the appellant has a number of psychiatric problems but they principally relate to her drug and alcohol use. Tendered before me today was material from Guthrie House indicating that the appellant has been able to live a drug free lifestyle. The report from Guthrie House tells me that regular urine analysis was conducted on the offender and no evidence of any drug use was detected. Also at Guthrie House she was regularly breathalysed and there was no evidence of any intoxication. 4 These reports related to a period leading up to a most tragic event. Ms Gill’s brother was murdered and it is clear for very understandable reasons that Ms Gill is grieving at the loss of her brother. In those circumstances there is a risk that Ms Gill will relapse but with appropriate treatment and support there is a very good prospect that Ms Gill will remain drug free and will not abuse alcohol. 5 As I read the material before me, if that is the case then she is unlikely to commit further offences. This is a matter where I consider that there needs to be some further time before I sentence Ms Gill in order that I can assess her capacity and prospects for rehabilitation and in order that I allow Ms Gill to demonstrate that she can remain drug free and that she can cease her abuse of alcohol. 6 I note at present that Ms Gill is not suitable for either periodic detention or community service due to what are described as anger management and substance abuse issues. I expect that in the period of remand Ms Gill will be able to deal with those matters and if she does it may well be the case that a further presentence report identifies her as being suitable for both of those alternatives to full time custody. 7 The result is therefore that I propose to adjourn this matter under s11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 8 I will list the matter at 2 o'clock on 19 October 2007. During the period of remand Ms Gill is to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. She is to report to the city district office within seven days of today’s date. She is to be subject to regular urine analysis. Any indication that Ms Gill has been using illegal drugs would be regarded as a breach of this bail. 9 She is to live at 139 Boundary Street Clovelly or such other address approved by the Probation and Parole Service. She is not to approach, contact or attempt to contact directly or indirectly Mr James Owens. One acceptable person is to enter into an agreement or agreements and deposit security to forfeit One thousand dollars if Ms Gill fails to comply with her bail undertaking. For the avoidance of any confusion that does not represent a further deposit of One thousand dollars but the security already deposited will be sufficient. 10 A failure to provide a urine sample upon request from the Probation and Parole Service will also be considered a breach of this bail. I order a pre-sentence report for 19 October 2007.11 Ms Gill, you have been listening to what I have been saying to your lawyer and Mr Crown. What I have given you is the opportunity to demonstrate to me that the good work you were doing at Guthrie House can continue. The reason I have not sentenced you today is because things are a bit at an early stage in your rehabilitation. I expect that you will be able to continue that good work and come back in October and show me that you have continued that rehabilitation. If you do not, however, I am going to be very disappointed. Judges tend to get disappointed when we give people like you an opportunity. So it is obviously in your interests to comply with conditions of bail.

    2 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Campbell JA. 
     
      
    3 CAMPBELL JA: The main topic in this application concerns the adequacy of a court attendance notice (“CAN”), used to initiate summary criminal proceedings in the Local Court, and the effect of an inadequacy in that CAN upon the validity of a conviction in those proceedings. 
     
      
       
      Proceedings Leading to This Application 
       
      
    4 The claimant was served with a CAN dated 5 July 2005. That notice stated that a matter in which he was the defendant was listed before the Downing Centre Local Court at a particular date and time. It had a box setting out certain identifying details of the claimant, a box setting out details of the prosecutor and police involved in the charge, and also had a box headed “details of offence/s”. The content of that box was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Crimes Act 1900, Section 59(1) – T2 Law Part Code 243 
        
       
       
        
        Assault occasioning actual bodily harm 
        
       
       
        
        Between 8:00 am and 5:30 pm on 24/03/2005 at Potts Point. 
        
       
       
        
        did assault Ann TEESE thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to her.” 
        
       
      
    5 The charge was heard before Magistrate Freund at the Downing Centre Local Court on 27 and 28 February 2006, when the matter was adjourned to obtain a pre-sentence report. On 11 April 2006 the claimant was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was placed on a bond.  
     
      
    6 On 9 May 2006 the claimant filed an appeal to the District Court against his conviction.  
     
      
    7 The appeal from the Local Court to the District Court was pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Section 11 of that Act enables any person who has been convicted or sentenced by a Local Court to appeal to the District Court against the conviction or sentence. 
     
      
    8 Pursuant to section 9 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, the Director of Public Prosecutions took over as respondent to the claimant’s conviction appeal. Notice of that fact was given to the District Court on 16 June 2006.  
     
      
    9 The appeal to the District Court was heard on 26 June 2006 by his Honour Judge Hosking SC. On 3 July 2006 the learned Judge dismissed the appeal, and confirmed both the conviction of the appellant, and the sentence imposed by the Magistrate. 
     
      
    10 On 21 July 2006 the claimant filed a summons in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of NSW that joined six defendants –Freund LCM, the Commissioner of Police, Judge Hosking SC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the District Court of New South Wales, and the Local Court at the Downing Centre in Sydney. That summons sought: 
     
      
       
        
        “O1. Orders in the nature of Certiorari and Prohibition quashing the purported conviction and orders made by the first defendant Magistrate Feund LCM, sitting in the Local Court Downing Centre Sydney on 27 and 28 February 2006, convicting the plaintiff of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm and sentencing him (‘the Local Court Orders’). 
        
       
       
        
        O2. Orders in the nature of Certiorari and Prohibition quashing the purported conviction and orders made by the third defendant his Honour Judge Hosking SC DCJ, sitting in Sydney on 3 July 2006, (which Orders confirmed the Local Court Orders). (‘The District Court Orders’) 
        
       
       
        
        O3. In the alternative to O1 and O2, Order in the nature of Mandamus under S 65 and/or S 69 of the Supreme Court Act ordering the Fifth Defendant, the District Court, to rehear the Plaintiff’s appeal from the Local Court Orders. 
        
       
       
        
        O4. Declaration that the Local Court Orders were ultra vires and without jurisdiction and so invalid and vitiated. 
        
       
       
        
        O5. Declaration that, further, the District Court Orders were: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          O5.1 ultra vires and without jurisdiction and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          O5.2 biased or gave rise to an apprehension of bias 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          and so invalid and vitiated. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        PARTICULARS: ULTRA VIRES AND WITHOUT JURISDICTION 
        
       
       
        
        The proceedings and orders are invalid because the purported Court Attendance Notice is defective and invalid in that it does not comply with Ss 172 and 175 of the Criminal Procedure Act, failing to  
        briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence. 
         Nor does it follow the prescribed form in this regard.” 
        
       
      
    11 On 15 September 2006 the Honourable Mr Justice Sully made an order under section 51 Supreme Court Act, removing the summons into the Court of Appeal.  
     
      
       
      Relevant Legislation 
       
      
    12 The offence with which the claimant was charged is created by section 59(1) Crimes Act 1900, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whosoever assaults any person, and thereby occasions actual bodily harm, shall be liable to imprisonment for five years.” 
        
       
      
    13 The following provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 are relevant: 
     
      
       
        
        “11. The description of any offence in the words of an Act … creating the offence, or in similar words, is sufficient in law. 
        
       
       
        
        12(1) For the purposes of this or any other Act, a summary offence, or an indictable offence that may be dealt with summarily, is taken to be sufficiently stated or described if it is stated or described by the use of a short expression that describes the offence in general terms. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) This section applies to a statement or description of an offence in any court attendance notice … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Nothing in this section affects any other method of stating or describing an offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) Nothing in this section affects any requirement made by or under this Act in relation to the form of a court attendance notice …” 
        
       
      
    14 Part 2 of Chapter 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 extends from section 15 to section 27 inclusive. Section 15(2) says: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this Part:  
        indictment 
         includes a court attendance notice …” 
        
       
      
    15 Relevant provisions of Part 2 of Chapter 2 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 are: 
     
      
       
        
        “16(2) No objection may be taken, or allowed, to any indictment by which criminal proceedings … in a local court … are commenced …, on the grounds of: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any alleged defect in it in substance or in form, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) any variance between it and the evidence adduced at the proceedings for the offence charged in the indictment ...” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        20 
          
        Amendment of Indictment 
        
       
       
        
        (1) An indictment may not be amended after it is presented, except by the prosecutor:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) with the leave of the court, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) with the consent of the accused. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) This section does not affect the powers of the court under section 21. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) For the purposes of this section, an amendment of an indictment includes the substitution of an indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial 
        
       
       
        
        (1) If of the opinion that an indictment is defective but, having regard to the merits of the case, can be amended without injustice, the court may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case.” 
        
       
      
    16 Part 2 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 runs from section 172 to section 219 inclusive. Pursuant to section 170 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, Part 2 of Chapter 4 applies to proceedings before a Local Court. 
     
      
    17 The following provisions in Part 2 of Chapter 4 are of present relevance: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        172 
          
        Commencement of proceedings by court attendance notice 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Proceedings for an offence are to be commenced in a court by the issue and filing of a court attendance notice in accordance with this Division. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        175 Form of court attendance notice 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A court attendance notice must be in writing and be in the form prescribed by the rules. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The rules may prescribe one or more forms of court attendance notice. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A court attendance notice must do the following:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) describe the offence, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) contain the name of the prosecutor, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) require the accused person to appear before the court at a specified date, time and place, unless a warrant is issued for the arrest of the person or the person is refused bail, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) state, unless a warrant is issued for the arrest of the person or the person is refused bail, that failure to appear may result in the arrest of the person or in the matter being dealt with in the absence of the person. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) The rules may prescribe additional matters to be included in court attendance notices. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) A court attendance notice may describe an offence, act or other thing in a way that is sufficient under this Act for the purposes of an indictment or an averment in an indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        183 Brief of evidence to be served on accused person where not guilty plea 
        
       
       
        
        (1) If an accused person pleads not guilty to an offence, the prosecutor must, subject to section 187, serve or cause to be served on the accused person a copy of the brief of evidence relating to the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The brief of evidence is to consist of documents regarding the evidence that the prosecutor intends to adduce in order to prove the commission of the offence and is to include:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) written statements taken from the persons the prosecutor intends to call to give evidence in proceedings for the offence, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) copies of any document or any other thing, identified in such a written statement as a proposed exhibit. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The copy of the brief of evidence is to be served at least 14 days before the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The Magistrate may set a later date for service with the consent of the accused person or if of the opinion that the circumstances of the case require it.” 
        
       
      
    18 The court can sometimes, under section 187, dispense with the requirement for service of the brief of evidence, but that possibility is not relevant in this case. 
     
      
    19 Section 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 defines “rules” as meaning: 
     
      
       
        
        “rules made for the purposes of a court to which the relevant provision applies.” 
        
       
       
      Thus, for the purpose of section 175  
      Criminal Procedure Act  
      as applied in the Local Court, the relevant  
      “rules” 
       were those under the  
      Local Courts (Criminal and Applications Procedure) Rule 2003 
      .  
       
      
    20 Clause 3 of that Rule defined “approved form” as meaning, in relation to a document: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the form approved for that document by the Chief Magistrate under clause 59 from time to time.” 
        
       
      
    21 Rule 59 of those Rules provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The Chief Magistrate may from time to time cause to be published in the Gazette approved forms for the purpose of this Rule. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) If there is no approved form for a document required to be filed in any proceedings in a Court, the registrar of the Court may approve the form of the document.” 
        
       
      
    22 No approved form of a CAN has been published in the Gazette. A form of CAN had been approved by the Chief Magistrate at some time prior to 13 June 2003 (the date on which the Rules were made), has been published on the Local Court’s official website, and has been in use throughout Local Courts since July 2003. That form includes the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “DETAILS OF OFFENCE  
         
          
           
           Description of OffenceTime & Date of Offence:Place of Offence:Short Particulars:Statutory Provision Describing Offence:Law Part Code: 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    23 There is no evidence that that form has been approved by the registrar (as opposed to the Chief Magistrate) of the Local Court. I conclude that the permission given by section 175(2) for the rules to prescribe one or more forms of CAN has not been acted upon, and that the requirement in section 175(1) that the CAN ""be in the form prescribed by the rules"" does not presently have any content. 
     
      
    24 The only “additional matters” that have been prescribed within the meaning of section 175(4) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 are those contained in Clause 17(2) Local Courts (Criminal and Applications Procedure) Rule 2003: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the purposes of section 175(4) of the Act, the court attendance notice must include the following matters: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the time and date of the alleged offence or, if the exact time and date are not known, the period of time in which the offence is alleged to have occurred, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the place where the offence is alleged to have occurred.” 
        
       
       
      The Claimant’s Contentions 
       
      
    25 The claimant accepts that the CAN with which he was served complies with the requirements of section 175(3)(a), and (c)-(e) Criminal Procedure Act, and also with section 175(4). However, he contends that it does not “briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence”, as is required by section 175(3)(b). In consequence, he submits, it is a nullity, it is ineffective to commence any proceedings, and his conviction is likewise a nullity. Hence, he submits, his conviction should be quashed. 
     
      
    26 There are many different ways, the claimant submits, in which an assault occasioning actual bodily harm can be committed. An assault can be committed by a medical operation performed without consent of the patient or other proper legal authority (Secretary, Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB; Marion's Case (1992) 175 CLR 218 at 232-235), by a punch or other blow (R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734), by intending to shoot someone’s hat off as a joke and accidentally shooting the person (at least when the victim of the joke is fearful for his or her safety) (R v Kingston (1884) 18 SALR 76) and in myriad other ways. As well, there are different types of actual bodily harm that can be sustained, and different parts of the body that can sustain the bodily harm. Thus, the claimant submits, to provide “the particulars of the alleged offence”, a CAN would need to state not only the person alleged to have been injured, but also the manner in which the assault was alleged to have occurred, and the type and location of the bodily injury alleged to have been caused by the assault. An example that the claimant gives of a CAN which would provide the particulars that section 175(3)(b) requires, concerning the offence with which he was charged, is one that stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The accused threw a television set at the face of the said Ann Teese in the accused’s office, which struck her on her raised arms, and he then seized her just below both elbows and pushed her against a wall of the office, causing bruising and contusions to her arms and head.” 
        
       
      
    27 The claimant presented various arguments why we should conclude that the CAN did not comply with section 175(3)(b). Rather than consider the detail of those arguments, I shall assume, without deciding, that the CAN with which the claimant was served did not “briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence”, and thus contravened section 175(3)(b) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. On that assumption, the question then concerns what the effect of such a contravention is. There are two different routes leading to the answer to that question. 
     
      
       
      The First Route – Direct Construction of the Statute 
       
      
    28 Section 175 is not the provision that confers upon the Local Court what might be called the general jurisdiction to decide summary prosecutions for a breach of section 59 Crimes Act. That jurisdiction arises as a result of the combined operation of three provisions. The first is section 7(2) Local Courts Act 1982, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Courts shall have the jurisdiction conferred or imposed on them by or under any Act or other law.” 
        
       
      
    29 The second is section 260(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “An indictable offence listed in Table 2 to Schedule 1 is to be dealt with summarily by a Local Court unless the prosecutor elects in accordance with this Chapter to have the offence dealt with on indictment.” 
        
       
      
    30 The third is clause 1 of Table 2 in Schedule 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That clause is a list that includes section 59 Crimes Act 1900, thereby giving content to section 260(2).  
     
      
    31 Section 175 is concerned with the manner of invoking, in a particular case, the general jurisdiction that the Local Court has to decide summary prosecutions for a breach of section 59 Crimes Act.  
     
      
    32 The fact that a statute that prescribes a mode of carrying out some action has been contravened does not necessarily mean that, in the eyes of the law, that action has not been carried out or is a nullity. In Project Blue Sky Inc & Others v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ considered the validity of a purported decision by an administrative body that was arrived at in contravention of a particular legislative requirement. At 388-389, [91] their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “An act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect. Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition. The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition.” 
        
       
      
    33 Their Honours went on, at 389-390, [92]-[93] to disapprove the distinction that had traditionally been made between mandatory and directory provisions in statutes, concluding, at 390-391, [93]: 
     
      
       
        
        “A better test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid. … In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to “the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute”:  
        Tasker v Fulwood

    34 While Project Blue Sky shows that failure to comply with a legislative requirement that some act must be done in a particular way does not always result in a failure, in the eyes of the law, to perform that act, there are particular considerations that relate to legislative provisions concerning the manner in which the jurisdiction of courts (as opposed to administrative bodies) is exercised or invoked. In Berowra Holdings Pty Ltd v Gordon [2006] HCA 32; (2006) 228 ALR 387 the majority judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ at [10], 389, pointed out that saying that an administrative decision reached without compliance with a statutory requirement was ""invalid"" or a ""nullity"" involved ""statements of conclusion which are not necessarily helpful in resolving the rights of parties"", and that ""Dangers are equally present in the context of proceedings in, and acts and orders of, courts."" 
     
      
    35 In Berowra Holdings at [13]-[16], 390-391 their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[13] 
          
        There also is a very real difficulty in characterising proceedings as “invalid”. The institution of an action or other proceeding is the exercise by the litigant of the freedom to invoke the jurisdiction of the judicial arm of government to determine a dispute. That step engages the procedural law appurtenant to the relevant court, which in modern times is found primarily in the Rules. 
         
         
        [14] 
          
        Professor Jolowicz describes procedural law as creating choices or a sequence of choices in the sense that each procedural step taken by a litigant requires the other party or the court to take some action, so affecting the path which the proceedings take towards ultimate disposition. This is the case even where a procedural rule is expressed in mandatory form; if the party to whom it is addressed chooses to disregard it, the normal outcome is that a choice accrues to the other party either to do nothing or to seek an appropriate order from the court. 
         
         
        [15]  
        In the adversarial system of justice, choice rests primarily with the parties and it is generally the case that the court’s power of decision or order is exercised upon the application of a party. Generally there is, in law, no restriction upon a person’s right to start an action and to carry it to the point at which a choice is cast upon the defendant to make some response in order to avoid judgment in default. Once the procedural law has been engaged, all parties to the litigation are subject to it. 
         
         
        [16]  
        None of the above denies the possibility of a defendant denying the plaintiff’s right to invoke the jurisdiction of the court, for example where the plaintiff’s right is conditional upon there being an action cognisable within that jurisdiction. However, the material point is that that denial must be made within the structure of the relevantly engaged procedural law, and not outside it. Accordingly, the defendant may challenge at an interlocutory level the strength of the plaintiff’s alleged case by seeking to have a plaintiff’s action struck out for failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action, or dismissed as incompetent.  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Alternatively, the defendant may have recourse to judicial review by a superior court, challenging the right of an inferior court to adjudicate the plaintiff’s claim and seeking orders to prevent the inferior court continuing to hear the claim. However, the invocation of jurisdiction ordinarily enlivens the authority of the court in question at least in the first instance to decide whether it has jurisdiction.” (footnotes omitted)  
          
         
        
       
      
    36 Berowra Holdings involved a civil case. Section 151C Workers Compensation Act 1987 provided that a person to whom compensation was payable under that Act was not entitled to commence court proceedings for damages in respect of the injury concerned, against the employer liable to pay the compensation, until six months had elapsed since notice of the injury was given to the employer. In Berowra Holdings, a worker had commenced proceedings in the District Court before the six months specified by section 151C had elapsed. The question at issue concerned whether the worker was free to accept, in the proceedings thereby begun, an offer of compromise that the employer had made, in in accordance with the District Court Rules. The employer argued that the proceedings were a nullity because of the contravention of section 151C, and in consequence the District Court Rules could not operate in respect of them. The High Court held that that argument was mistaken. Notwithstanding the clear differences between the factual circumstances in which Berowra Holdings arose and the present case, the remarks from the majority judgment in Berowra Holdings that I have set out above are in quite general terms, and are not dependent on any aspect of the particular facts in Berowra Holdings. In my view, they are also applicable in summary criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    37 As well, when a particular statutory provision relates to the exercising by a court of jurisdiction, particular principles of construction of legislation come into play. In Berowra Holdings at [31], 394, the majority said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        [31]  
        In the joint judgment of five members of this court in  
        Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth 
         (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 505 [72], reference was made to a “basic rule” that a legislature does not intend to cut down the jurisdiction of the courts “save to the extent that the legislation in question expressly so states or necessarily implies”. Earlier, in  
        Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte 
         (1938) 59 CLR 369 at 391; [1938] ALR 119 at 128, Dixon J said:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            [I]f the legislature does make the jurisdiction of a court contingent upon the actual existence of a state of facts, as distinguished from the court’s opinion or determination that the facts do exist, then the validity of the proceedings and orders must always remain an outstanding question until some other court or tribunal, possessing power to determine that question, decides that the requisite state of facts in truth existed and the proceedings of the court were valid. Conceding the abstract possibility of the legislature adopting such a course, nevertheless it produces so inconvenient a result that no enactment dealing with proceedings in any of the ordinary courts of justice should receive such an interpretation unless the intention is clearly expressed.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    38 Because of the special considerations relating to statutory provisions concerning the jurisdiction of courts that I have quoted so far from Berowra Holdings, it seems to me that when the majority judges, at [28], 393 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Project Blue Sky 
         was not concerned with questions relating to the jurisdiction of courts.” 
        
       
       
      they were making a more general point than one limited to the particular subject matter in dispute in that case. 
       
      
    39 The requirement created by section 175(3)(b) is an imperfect obligation, in the sense that it does not make express provision for the consequences of failure to comply with it. Nothing in the statute states that proceedings purportedly commenced without complying with section 175(3)(b) will be invalid or a nullity or in any other way of no effect. Thus, it is only if there is a necessary implication to that effect that such a consequence will arise. 
     
      
    40 In a situation like the present, where it is not alleged that the CAN fails to identify all the elements of an offence, I do not find in the statute any necessary implication that any failure of the CAN to “briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence” should result in either the CAN, or a conviction in proceedings begun by the CAN, being void.  
     
      
    41 Indeed, there are several indications in the statute and in the manner in which it operates that indicate that a failure to comply with section 175(3)(b) when issuing a CAN does not result in the invalidity of a conviction obtained in proceedings purportedly begun by that CAN. 
     
      
    42 First, if it were the case that a prosecutor were to file in the Local Court a CAN that did not comply with section 175(3)(b), it would have to be the case that the Local Court had at least the power to decide whether any valid proceedings had been commenced by that document, and whether (regardless of the outcome of the dispute) a costs order should be made against one party or the other concerning that dispute. In those circumstances, it could not be the case that the CAN was a total nullity, otherwise there would be no proceedings before the court within which those disputes could occur. 
     
      
    43 Second, section 175 makes three different types of requirement for a CAN. The first is that it be in writing. The second relates to the form that the CAN should have. The third (and it is this that is dealt with by section 175(3), and might also be affected by section 175(4)) is not concerned with mere matters of form, but matters of substance, concerning the information that is to be contained in the CAN. Thus, because section 175(3) does not merely relate to matters of form, section 12(4) does not have the effect that section 12 is irrelevant to it.  
     
      
    44 Each of section 12(1), (2) and (3) uses (through differing grammatical cognates) two different notions – that of stating the offence, and that of describing the offence. Those verbs are precisely the ones used in section 175(3)(a) and (b). As well, section 12(1) and section 175(3)(b) both contain the notion of brevity or shortness. In section 175(3)(b), “briefly” is an adverb that qualifies the requirement to “state the particulars of the alleged offence”. I recognise that section 12(1) is concerned with stating or describing the offence itself, while section 175(3)(b) creates an obligation to state “the particulars of” the offence. Even so, it seems to me that section 12(1) can cast light upon the degree of specificity with which an offence needs to be described and particularised in the CAN. That light is cast in an imprecise way, through creating an impression that the shade of meaning to be attributed to the general words of section 175(3)(a) and (b) is at the less elaborate rather than the more elaborate end of the spectrum of meanings that those general words can bear. The way one gains this sort of impression about shades of meaning falls well short of a rigorous logical process. However, alertness to nuances of meaning and shades of language is a legitimate part of the task of construing the statute as a whole, and having regard to the scope and object of the whole statute. It is one part, though in the present case is not a sufficient part, of deciding whether there is any necessary intendment in the Criminal Procedure Act that a CAN that does not comply with section 175(3)(b) is invalid. 
     
      
    45 I accept that, because it deals only with the description of the offence, section 11 Criminal Procedure Act bears only on section 175(3)(a), and does not have any bearing on section 175(3)(b). 
     
      
    46 Third, the nature of the obligation created by section 175(3)(b) is also relevant. The obligation it creates is nowhere near as precise as, for example, the obligations contained in section 175(3)(c), (d) and (e). It is possible to say with certainty whether the CAN, for example, contains the name of the prosecutor, or does not. But it is not as though there is a catalogue that lists “the particulars” for any offence, by reference to which one can decide with comparable certainty whether there has been compliance with section 175(3)(b). Rather, the particulars of an offence are a statement of the way in which, in the circumstances of the particular case, the prosecutor alleges that the general standard of conduct imposed by the provision of the law that creates the offence has been breached. Because particulars are dependent on the circumstances of the individual case in this way, the particulars of an offence are not formulaic, and are likely to differ from one CAN to another, even where one is comparing CANs that all charge the same offence. Another consequence of particulars being dependent on the circumstances of the individual case is that there can be legitimate differences of opinion about whether proper particulars have been provided. It is possible to state the manner in which a case is proposed to be put at higher, or lower, degrees of particularity. It is ultimately a matter of judgment, not a simple matter of fact, as to whether adequate particulars have been supplied of the allegation that a CAN makes of commission of an identified offence. That judgment is one that must be formed bearing in mind the purpose of particulars, as well as the specific offence that is alleged. Though originally stated in the context of civil litigation, the remarks of Hunt J in Sims v Wran [1984] 1 NSWLR 317 at 321-322 are applicable to the purpose of providing particulars of a criminal offence: 
     
      
       
        
        The fundamental principle in relation to particulars in defamation, as in any other case, is that a party must be made aware of the nature of the case he is called upon to meet:

        Dare v Pulham 
          
        (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664. The object of particulars is to save expense in preparing to meet a case which may never be put:

        (1964) 81 WN (Pt 1) (N.S.W.) 553 at 557, 558;  
        Ellis v Grant 
          
        (1970) 91 WN (NSW) 920 at 924, 925. It is not a question of whether one party has adequate knowledge of the actual facts; it is a question of whether he has adequate knowledge of what the other party alleges are the facts, for that is the case which he must meet:  
        Turner v Dalgety & Co Ltd 
         (at 229);  
        Philliponi v Leithead 
         (at 359; 152);  
        Emmerton v University of Sydney 
         [1970] 2 NSWR 633 at 635;  
        Bailey v Federal Commission of Taxation 
         (at 219, 220, 221).  
        
       
       
        
        There is often a fine line between giving particulars of the case which a party proposes to make and disclosing the evidence by which that case is to be proved. It all depends upon what is necessary to guard the other party against surprise. If the other party cannot otherwise be so guarded, it may sometimes be necessary for a party to disclose his evidence, or at least a broad outline of it. The starting point is what is necessary to guard the other party against surprise; the starting point is not what can be said without disclosing the evidence to be led.” 
        
       
       
      Whether a set of particulars that has been provided fulfils that purpose is a matter that involves judgment, and is not a simple matter of fact. 
       
      
    47 That the standard of conduct created by section 175(3)(b) is imprecise in these ways is one factor against there being any necessary intendment that, if section 175(3)(b) was breached, that would invalidate the entire proceeding begun by the CAN. 
     
      
    48 Fourth, by reason of the extended meaning of “indictment” given by section 15(2), section 16(2) applies to a CAN. The wording of section 16(2) is broad, and its reference to a defect in a CAN “in substance or in form” is capable of applying, as a matter of language, to a failure to state the particulars of the alleged offence. It may be that, in some circumstances, there are deficiencies in a CAN so gross that as a matter of construction section 16(2)(a) would be read as not applying to them: cf The King v Hickman & Others; ex parte Fox & Clinton (1945) 70 CLR 598. There is no need to decide whether that is so, as the argument we are asked to consider in this application is whether, when the CAN identified all the elements of the offence, any failure to comply with section 175(3)(b) has the effect that the proceedings purportedly commenced by the CAN that breaches that requirement are void. 
     
      
    49 The claimant argued that section 16(2) had no application in the present circumstances, because it applies only to “any indictment” (including in that expression the extended meaning of “any CAN”) and, because section 175(3) sets out what a CAN “must” do, any CAN that fails to comply with section 175(3) was not the type of entity to which section 16(2) could apply. I do not accept the correctness of that process of reasoning. The exercise I am presently engaged in is one of deciding whether a failure to comply with one or other of the requirements of section 175(3) renders void the CAN and any resultant proceedings. The argument that the claimant advances already presumes the answer to that question by asserting that section 16(2) applies only to valid CANs, and hence not to a CAN that breaches any of the requirements of section 175(3). Rather, the task of construction that should be performed is one that involves construing the whole statute. 
     
      
    50 Fifth, the express power of amendment of a CAN that is conferred by section 21 is, in its terms, capable of applying to a CAN that is defective by reason of a failure to comply with section 175(3)(b). As section 21 is wide enough to permit an amendment of any particulars that were originally contained in a CAN, it would be strange if the legislature intended that a failure to fully state particulars in the CAN at the outset made that CAN void. 
     
      
    51 Sixth, one of the purposes of the legislature in enacting section 175(3)(b) was that a person who was subject to a charge should have sufficient information about the allegations that were to be made against him or her to be able to prepare a defence. Requiring particulars to be given at the earliest stage of the proceedings, in a CAN, is an aid to the fair and efficient conduct of the proceedings. However, those purposes of the legislature are not ones that can be put into effect only if the invalidity of proceedings is a consequence of a failure to comply with section 175(3)(b). The provisions of section 183, requiring the service on the accused of a copy of the brief of evidence, also give effect to the legislature’s intention that a defendant be well informed about the nature of the case proposed to be advanced against him or her. If the CAN provided the only information that an accused would receive about the case he or she was required to answer, one can see that there could be good practical sense in requiring the CAN itself to contain, at the risk of invalidity if it did not, all the information that an accused should fairly be given to prepare a defence. However, when section 183 makes provision for the accused receiving much more information about the case he or she is required to meet than is written in the CAN itself, there is not the same practical point in the legislature intending invalidity of the CAN to be the consequence of failure to comply with every detail of section 175(3).  
     
      
    52 I recognise that while provision of the brief of evidence goes some way towards informing a defendant of the case he or she is called on to meet, its provision is not the same as, and is not a full substitute for, the provision of particulars. However, it is in courts that existed before section 175 was introduced that the procedure it established comes to be applied. As will be seen at paras [69]-[71] below, there is a well established power for courts exercising criminal jurisdiction to require, without need for any express grant of power, extra particulars to be given concerning any criminal proceeding that is pending in that court. Section 175(3) should be construed, it seems to me, bearing in mind that that power already exists. That power provides a means whereby a defendant can obtain proper particulars of a criminal charge if they are not contained in the CAN. This provides another reason why there is no practical need to construe each of the requirements of section 175 as one that, if not met, will result in the invalidity of the CAN and any resulting proceedings. 
     
      
    53 Seventh, another aid to construction is that the word ""must"" appears in both section 175(1) and in section 175(3). Section 175(1) states that a CAN ""must"" be in the form prescribed by the rules – yet section 175(2) confers a mere permission for the rules to prescribe court forms, rather than a positive requirement. The form of the legislation therefore left open the possibility, which has in fact happened, that there is no prescribed form. It would be strange if a failure to comply with section 175(1), through not using ""the form prescribed by the rules"" for a CAN, made that CAN void. Indeed, if that were so, every CAN that the Local Court has issued since the commencement of section 175 would be void, all convictions obtained pursuant to proceedings commenced by such a CAN would be void, and all acquittals obtained in proceedings commenced by such a CAN would be likewise void and so would not give rise to a defence of autrefois acquit. I doubt that the legislature is likely to have intended those consequences. If a failure to comply with what section 175(1) says ""must"" be done does not necessarily result in invalidity of the CAN, that suggests that failure to comply with what section 175(3) says ""must"" be done does not necessarily result in invalidity of the CAN either. 
     
      
    54 Eighth, there are some circumstances in which a CAN being void if it breached section 175(3)(b) would be an interference with the fair and efficient dealing with allegations of criminal conduct. If a defendant was anxious to get to court and obtain a decision on the merits, but the particulars in the CAN breached section 175(3)(b), there would be no valid proceedings in which he could obtain proper particulars, and no valid proceedings in which he could clear his name. I doubt that the legislature would intend such a situation to arise. 
     
      
    55 Ninth and finally, I mention some facts concerning the present case. 
     
      
    56 Even before the CAN was filed with the Local Court, the claimant was served with a copy of the CAN and also a police facts sheet, comprising four pages of typing. Approximately three of those pages of typing were a prose description of the events that the police proposed to contend were involved in the incident that was the subject of the charge. The full police brief of evidence was served on 6 October 2005. It included a statement by Ms Teese that included her account of the incident. No compliant has been made that it did not include all the information that section 183 requires be included. 
     
      
    57 The claimant made no application for better particulars of the charge, either prior to the hearing in the Local Court, or at the Local Court hearing itself. He made no submission to the Magistrate that the CAN was void and that hence, the Magistrate had no jurisdiction. 
     
      
    58 The appeal to the District Court was an “all grounds” appeal. The Notice of Appeal stated the grounds of appeal to be “because I am not guilty”. No complaint was made to his Honour Judge Hosking about the inadequacy of the particulars that had been supplied, nor was any argument advanced in the District Court appeal, that the conviction was void by reason of the inadequacy of the particulars contained in the CAN.  
     
      
    59 One does not construe legislation by reference to the facts of an individual case. However, the general type of situation that I have just set out concerning the facts of this case – where a person served with a CAN contests on the merits the allegations made against him both before a magistrate, and in the District Court on appeal, loses on both occasions, and then seeks to argue in the Court of Appeal, in proceedings in the nature of ones seeking a prerogative writ, that the entire course of proceedings in both the Local Court and the District Court is a nullity – is one that could readily be predicted to arise, if it were correct that a failure to comply with section 175(3)(b) made the CAN void. While this is nothing like the most powerful of the arguments concerning construction of section 175 that I have here set out, it seems unlikely that the legislature would have intended to pass a law that operated in this wasteful fashion. 
     
      
    60 In all these circumstances, and purely as a matter of construction of the legislation, I do not conclude that the legislature intended that a contravention of section 175(3)(b) would result in the invalidity of the CAN, and of any convictions that result in proceedings commenced by such a CAN.

            (ii) if the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the Act or statutory rule and the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule and, in the case of a statutory rule, the purpose or object underlying the Act under which the rule was made) leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    62 Section 34(2)(f) includes in the extrinsic material that is permitted to be looked at: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “the speech made to a House of Parliament by a Minister or other member of Parliament on the occasion of the moving by that Minister or member of a motion that the Bill for the Act be read a second time in that House,” 
          
         
        
       
      
    63 The Justices Act 1902 governed the procedure for summary trial of criminal offences before magistrates until it was repealed with effect from 7 July 2003. One of the Acts that replaced it is the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Courts) Act 2001. That legislation introduced into the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 procedural provisions, including section 175. Before the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Courts) Act 2001 came into operation, the provisions of section 175 were amended by the Courts Legislation Miscellaneous Amendments Act 2002. The section 175(3)(b) that had been legislated for by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Courts) Act 2001, but never commenced operation, had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) identify the essential factual elements of the alleged offence” 
        
       
       
      The  
      Courts Legislation Miscellaneous Amendments Act 2002 
       replaced those words with the present wording: 
       
       
        
        “(b) briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence” 
        
       
      
    64 In the course of making the second reading speech in the Legislative Assembly of the Bill for that last-mentioned Act on 23 October 2002, Mr Moss, the Parliamentary Secretary for the Attorney General, said that, as then enacted, sections 50 and 175 of the Criminal Procedure Act 
     
      
       
        
        "" … make references to new terminology which may be ambiguous. It was not intended that the Justices Act reform package change the law in relation to the contents of the initiating process. Therefore sections 50 and 175 will be amended to more closely reflect the language of the current law."" 
        
       
      
    65 In the course of making the second reading speech in the Legislative Council on 21 November 2001 the Parliamentary Secretary introducing the Bill, Mr McDonald, used virtually identical words to those that Mr Moss had used. 
     
      
    66 Thus, it was the legislature’s apparent intention that section 175 be construed in a way that does not alter the previous law concerning the contents of the initiating process for a summary offence. I turn to consider that previous law, as an aid to construction of section 175. 
     
      
    67 Under the Justices Act 1902, a summary criminal procedure for which the consent of the defendant was not required was generally commenced by a prosecutor laying an information before a justice of the peace. There was no necessity for that information to be in writing or sworn unless the statute creating the offence so required, or unless a warrant for the arrest of the defendant was sought. Once the information was laid, the justice could issue a summons for the appearance of the defendant. If the defendant failed to appear in answer to the summons then, once service of the summons had been proved, a warrant for the arrest of the defendant could be issued, and the hearing adjourned. Alternatively, the case could be proceeded with in the absence of the defendant: section 52–60, 74–77 Justices Act 1902. 
     
      
    68 In Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 153 at 165-167 Jordan CJ traced the history of supervisory control in England over the exercise of summary jurisdiction by justices. By 1848 the situation had been reached where (167) ""large numbers of delinquents escaped punishment upon grounds some of which were highly technical."" In 1848 the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1848 (Imp) (11 & 12 Vic c 43), also known as Jervis’ Act, was passed in England, containing various provisions aimed at rendering summary convictions less open to attack. Other procedural legislation with a similar objective, discussed by Jordan CJ in Lovell at 168-170, was also introduced in England during the 19th century. Legislation on these English models was also passed in New South Wales. Two provisions are of particular relevance to the present case. One is section 65 Justices Act 1902, which provided that no objection should be taken or allowed to any information in respect of any alleged defects therein in substance or in form. The other is 145A Justices Act 1902, introduced in 1909, that permitted an information to specify the offence in the same terms as the statute that created it.  
     
      
    69 Because an information was, in essence, a complaint or allegation made to a justice, there was some doubt about whether the court (as opposed to the person who had made it in the first place) had any power to amend it: Phillips v The Corporate Affairs Commission [1974] 2 NSWLR 489 at 495-496; Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill and another (1993) 32 NSWLR 501 at 516. That doubt included doubt about whether the court could order that particulars be added to an information, if the prosecutor did not add them voluntarily. (The doubt has now been removed by section 21 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.) However, notwithstanding statutory provisions such as those found in section 145A Justices Act 1902 that permitted an information to specify the offence in the same terms as the statute that created it, all courts hearing summary criminal matters had jurisdiction to order that further particulars be given of the information, and in default of them being given, to order that the information be dismissed: Smith v Moody [1903] 1 KB 56 at 60, 61, 63; Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 486; Ex parte Graham; Re Dowling and another (1968) 88 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 270 at 280. The situation was stated succinctly by Jordan CJ in Ex parte Ryan; Re Johnson (1944) 44 SR (NSW) 12, at 16: 
     
      
       
        
        "" … it is quite clear that the accused is entitled to have sufficient particulars of what is charged against him to enable him to prepare his defence, and if these be not supplied by the information and are not otherwise communicated to him, the magistrate may and should direct him to be supplied with particulars, and grant any adjournment necessary to enable him to meet them."" 
        
       
      
    70 Though that power to order particulars has sometimes been described as an ""inherent"" power of the court (e.g. Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 497 per Evatt J.; Ex parte Graham; Re Dowling and another (1968) 88 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 270 at 280 per Asprey JA, with whom Wallace P agreed), the terminology of ""inherent"" power could be confusing in relation to inferior courts, and the power is better described as an ""implied"" power: Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 at 671 per Gleeson CJ (with whom Priestley and Meagher JJA agreed) .  
     
      
    71 The basis for the practice of ordering particulars of an information when there was no specific statutory power enabling it to be done, and for regarding the ability to order such particulars as being an implied power of all courts possessing summary criminal jurisdiction, lay in natural justice – if a body called a court was given power to impose criminal sanctions on a person, it was a necessary part of that power that it be administered in accordance with natural justice, part of which is that anyone charged with an offence is entitled to know what is the charge he or she is called upon to meet (Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 479 per Latham CJ (diss), 490 per Dixon J (“if … the interests of justice make it necessary""), 497-498 per Evatt J; Lovell at 173; Ex parte Graham; Re Dowling and another (1968) 88 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 270 at 280.  
     
      
    72 In Lovell at 169-170 Jordan CJ referred to certain English cases that appeared to have held that it was necessary for an information to not only describe the offence, but also to accompany the description with particulars of the act relied on as constituting the offence. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""These authorities seem to be based on the view that it is essential that the accused should have sufficient particulars to prepare his defence. No exception can be taken to this view; but the object, as is pointed out by Evatt J. in  
        Davies v Ryan  
        (1933) 50 CLR 379 at 386, can be secured otherwise than by insisting upon a retention of the old rule that these particulars must necessarily be given upon the face of the information itself. In view of the decision last quoted, it is open to question how far the earlier authorities should be treated as binding: cf  
        Preston v Donohoe  
        (1906) 3 CLR 1089 at 1091, 1096;  
        Ex parte Parkinson  
        (1909) 9 SR 174 ."" 
        
       
      
    73 I respectfully agree with this view of Jordan CJ, save in one respect – in my view the last sentence quoted did not go far enough and the “earlier authorities” are incorrect to the extent to which they required (or appeared to require) that the particulars actually accompany the information. Preston v Donohoe involved an application for prohibition of a NSW magistrate, who had convicted the masters of two ships on charges of being the master of a vessel from which a prohibited immigrant entered the Commonwealth contrary to the Immigration Restriction Acts of 1901 and 1905. Those Acts created various different classes of prohibited immigrants. The information did not specify the particular class of prohibited immigrant within which the immigrant in question was alleged to fall. Griffith CJ, delivering the judgment of the Court, stated, at 1096: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The next objection was that the particular class of prohibited immigrant within which Mahomet Mithoo was alleged to fall was not specified in the information. It may be convenient, but we doubt whether it is necessary, that this should be stated in the information. Assuming that it is strictly speaking necessary, which we do not decide, this objection also is cured by the sections of the  
        Justices Act 1902  
        already mentioned.""  
        
       
      
    74 The “sections already mentioned” were section 65 and section 115 Justices Act 1902. It seems to me that in the passage I have quoted above from Lovell, Jordan CJ was not recognising the full force of the High Court decision to which he referred. The upholding of the convictions in Preston v Donohoe seems to me to necessarily carry with it a consequence that failure to provide full particulars of an offence in the information did not result in the invalidity of a conviction based on that information. 
     
      
    75 Indeed, Jordan CJ's own view was not consistent with those ""earlier authorities"" being correct. In Lovell at 173-174 Jordan CJ said that section 65 
     
      
       
        
        ""… does not enable a magistrate to convict of an offence upon an information which discloses no offence, or to convict of an offence alleged in the information if the evidence does not support that offence, or to convict of an offence established by the evidence if it is a different offence from that charged in the information. … If, however, the information and summons charge all ingredients of the offence, the fact that particulars which should have been given have been omitted is a matter covered by s 65…"" 
        
       
      
    76 The law as so laid down by Jordan CJ did not change in the period between 1938 and the time the Justices Act was repealed in 2003. In Boral Gas at 515 Mahoney JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is, I think, no exhaustive and definitive statement of what is necessary and sufficient to be contained in an information: see generally,  
        John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) 
         (1987) 163 CLR 508;  
        De Romanis v Sibraa 
         [1977] 2 NSWLR 264. Ordinarily, the information must state, and state correctly, the essential elements in law of the offence charged, the time of its commission, the place and manner of its occurrence and such other details as are necessary to allow the defendant to know that which he must meet. And the information must state only one offence: it will otherwise be objectionable as for duplicity. If the information is not, in this regard, in proper form, it is defective.  
         
         
        Where an information is defective, at least three questions may arise: may the information be amended to cure the defect?; may the defect be ignored or put aside?; and (if it may not be amended or ignored) is the defect such that proceedings upon it will be stayed or a conviction quashed? It is to informations which are defective in this third sense that I use the term ""void"".” 
        
       
      
    77 Concerning defective informations, Mahoney JA considered, at 517, the effect of section 65 Justices Act 1902: 
     
      
       
        
        “It allows proceedings to continue where the defect is such that it may be cured in other ways. Thus, if the defect consists of insufficient particulars to allow the defendant to know the case to be met, those particulars may be supplied. If the defect be one as to details of time, place or perhaps name of the defendant, the correct details may be provided in evidence and the variance between what is in the information and what is in the evidence can be ignored: see s 65(3).  
         
         
        But on a literal approach, s 65 would offer no assistance if the defect lay in, for example, a mis-statement of the offence such that it could be corrected only by the deletion of the existing statement of it and the substitution of a corrected statement. In  
        Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckley  
        (at 168) 
        , Jordan CJ saw the English decisions of the equivalent legislation as establishing that it did not apply ""if it appears that the information does not allege all the ingredients of the statutory offence"" or that the evidence did not prove it.  
        
       
       
        
        Accordingly, absent power in the lower court to amend the information to remove the particular defects, statutory provisions such as s 65 do not remove all of the defects for which proceedings on the information may be restrained or convictions quashed. It is, in general, to informations defective in this way that the term ""void"" has ordinarily been applied. I have in the present case used it in this sense.” 
        
       
      
    78 In other words, under the Justices Act 1902, if an information alleged all the essential elements of an offence, but was inadequately particularised, a resulting conviction was not void.  
     
      
    79 The tendency of the reasoning in Stanton v Abernathy is in the same direction. Though Stanton concerned a committal hearing rather than a summary trial, section 30 Justices Act 1902 applied to committal hearings, and was in terms not materially different to those of section 65. The Court of Appeal held that, through the combined operation of section 145A and section 30, a charge that was deficient should be supplemented by particulars, rather than simply dismissed. In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v David Alderman (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 8 August 1997, unreported) Sperling J considered a summary charge (not a committal) that was lacking in particulars. He held there was no relevant distinction to be drawn from Stanton. Thus, in consequence of section 65 and section 145A, he concluded that further particulars should be supplied, but that it would be wrong to dismiss the charge on the basis that the particulars were insufficient. 
     
      
    80 In Taylor v Environment Protection Authority [2000] NSWCCA 71; (2000) 50 NSWLR 48, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Sperling J (with whom Meagher JA and James J agreed) said, at [26], 57: 
     
      
       
        
        “A distinction is drawn between informations which fail to specify the legal elements of the offence and those where essential factual particulars have not been given. Where an information fails to specify the essential legal elements of the offence, the information is not saved by a Lord Jervis provision:  
        Ex parte Price 
         (1899) 20 LR (NSW) 343;  
        Ex parte Bartlett 
         (1896) 17 LR (NSW) 108;  
        Ex parte Thomas; Re Otzen

        Ex parte Burnett; Re Wicks 
         [1968] 2 NSWR 119;  
        Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill 
         (1993) 32 NSWLR 501 at 517, per Mahoney JA. Where, however, the legal elements of the offence are specified and the defect lies only in a failure to specify essential factual particulars — such as the time, place, or the manner of the offence — a Lord Jervis provision will operate:  
        John L Pty Ltd 
          
        (at 529 and 530), per Brennan J;  
        Stanton v Abernathy 
         (at 667), per Gleeson CJ;  
        R v Cassell  
        (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 July 1996, unreported);  
        R v Duff 
         (1924) 41 WN (NSW) 23.” 
        
       
      
    81 The claimant placed some reliance on John L Proprietary Ltd v The Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales (1987) 163 CLR 508. In John L  the High Court held invalid a summary conviction on an information that alleged, in the same words as the statute creating the offence, that a particular advertisement was ""knowingly false or misleading in a material particular"", without saying what that “material particular” was. The reason why that conclusion was reached was influenced by the fact that the conviction had been brought in the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and a provision, section 6 Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967, that prevented objection being taken to certain applications by reason of alleged defects in it in substance or in form, was held not to apply to the proceedings that were the subject of that case. The majority in the High Court (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ) referred to section 65 and 145A Justices Act 1902, and said, at 519-520: 
     
      
       
        
        “One can point to statements of authority which lend support for the view that that legislation did not go so far as to abrogate the requirement that a valid information must at least identify the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence: see, e.g,  
        Smith v Moody  
        [1903] 1 KB 56, at p 60;  
        Johnson v Miller  
        (1937) 59 CLR 467, at pp 486-487, 501;  
        Ex parte Graham; Re Dowling  
        (1968) 88 WN (NSW) 270, at p 280. It is, however, unnecessary to pursue that particular question here since, putting to one side s 6 of the  
        Summary Jurisdiction Act  
        to which detailed reference is subsequently made, it is not suggested that Yeldham J was in error in holding that such of those legislative provisions which might have operated to cure the defect in the information in the present case were not applicable in respect of an information laid before, or to proceedings in, the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction. That being so, the common law requirement remains that an information must at the least condescend to identifying the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence.”  
        
       
      
    82 Thus, the decision in John L does not relate to the validity of a conviction, on the basis of an information that was not fully particularised on the face of a document notifying the accused of the information, in a court of summary jurisdiction to which the Justices Act 1902 applied. Nor does it relate to an information to which a provision like section 65 Justices Act or section 16(2) Criminal Procedure Act applies. Thus, the majority judgment does not assist in deciding whether an information was void if it did not contain full particulars, under the Justices Act. 
     
      
    83 It follows that, under the law that applied before the introduction of section 175 Criminal Procedure Act, a failure to supply particulars in an information did not invalidate any proceedings commenced by that information. As the apparent intention of the legislature in enacting section 175(3)(b) was not to alter the pre-existing state of affairs under the Justices Act concerning the contents of informations, this consideration of the pre-existing law leads to the same conclusion as I have arrived at from a construction of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act considered in isolation. 
     
      
    84 Given the conclusion that I have arrived at as a matter of construction, it is not necessary to give any further consideration to whether it is open to the claimant to allege before this Court, that the CAN was invalid, when that point was not taken either before the Magistrate or on the appeal to the District Court. Nor is it necessary to consider how section 176 District Court Act 1973 (which provides ""no adjudication on appeal of the District Court is to be removed by any order into the Supreme Court"") affects the present proceedings. 
     
      
       
      Bias 
       
      
    85 An independent basis upon which the claimant sought relief was that the decision of Judge Hosking should be set aside on the ground of the apparent bias of the Judge. No case of actual bias was alleged. 
     
      
    86 There was no dispute about the relevant legal principles governing the setting aside of a judicial decision for apprehended bias. They were stated in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 344-345, [6] by Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the governing principle is that, subject to qualifications relating to waiver … or necessity … a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. That principle gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done, a requirement which reflects the fundamental importance of the principle that the tribunal be independent and impartial.” 
        
       
      
    87 No suggestion is made that the judge had any prior connection with, or knowledge of, the parties to the appeal. 
     
      
    88 Section 18 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 requires (subject to an exception not presently relevant) that an appeal against a conviction in the Local Court be by way of re-hearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings.  
     
      
    89 Such an appeal is not a hearing de novo, but rather an appeal conducted on the same principles as an appeal from a judge sitting without a jury: Gianoutsos v Glykis (2006) 65 NSWLR 539; Charara v The Queen (2006) 164 A Crim R 39; [2006] NSWCCA 244.  
     
      
    90 The hearing of the District Court appeal took place on Monday, 26 June 2006, and was completed within that day. Judgment was delivered on 3 July 2006. 
     
      
    91 On 26 June 2006, after the matter was called on, the claimant (who is a solicitor, and appeared for himself) and a representative of the Crown, each made some brief opening remarks. His Honour then retired to read the papers relating to the hearing in the Local Court (including the transcript), and written submissions supplied by at least the claimant. 
     
      
    92 There had never been any dispute that Ms Teese had come to be injured while in the claimant’s office. The evidence before the Magistrate included conflicting accounts, from the claimant and from Ms Teese, about the circumstances of the incident in which she came to be injured. A fundamental submission of the claimant in the District Court was that Ms Teese “has a serious credit problem”. The claimant pointed, both orally and in written submissions, to what he submitted were various inconsistent statements she had made, and various alleged implausibilities in her account of events. 
     
      
    93 Upon returning from reading the papers, the Judge asked the claimant various questions, to elucidate and test the submissions that the claimant wished to make.  
     
      
    94 His Honour’s judgment gave a précis of the account of the incident that Ms Teese had given, a précis of the account of the incident that the complainant had given, and considered whether the evidence supported one version or the other. 
     
      
    95 The question of whether there is an apprehension that a judge is biased is a different question to whether there has been any error of law in the conduct of the appeal. That a judge has not accepted submissions, or has taken a view of evidence in a way that one of the litigants disagrees with or asserts is wrong in principle, is not enough to establish a reasonable apprehension of bias. In saying that, I make clear that I am not saying anything about whether there has actually been any such error on the part of Judge Hosking.  
     
      
    96 The manner in which the apprehension of bias principle operates was stated in Ebner at 345, [7]-[8] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “7. Deciding whether a judicial officer (or juror)  
        might 
         not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of a question that has not been determined requires no prediction about how the judge or juror will in fact approach the matter. The question is one of possibility (real and not remote), not probability. Similarly, if the matter has already been decided, the test is one which requires no conclusion about what factors  
        actually 
         influenced the outcome. No attempt need be made to inquire into the actual thought processes of the judge or juror. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. The bare assertion that a judge (or juror) has an “interest” in litigation, or an interest in a party to it, will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest, and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision-making, is articulated. Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed.” 
        
       
      
    97 I accept that it is appropriate to look at not only the transcript, but also the reasons for judgment, when deciding whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the judge. To take an extreme example, if a judge in a judgment said, “I am always very suspicious of the evidence of people from Ruritania”, in a case where one of the witnesses came from Ruritania, that could be a significant factor in deciding whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not have brought an impartial mind to his or her task.  
     
      
    98 In the present case, having read the whole of the transcript and judgment in the District Court, I find nothing from which a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not have brought an impartial mind to the resolution of the question before him. Nothing was suggested to us, and nothing emerges from my own reading of the papers, that identifies what it is that might have led the judge to decide the case other than on its legal and factual merits. When no such thing can be identified, it is impossible to carry out the “second step” identified in Ebner at [8].  
     
      
    99 In my view, there is no substance at all in the submission that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of Judge Hosking.  
     
      
    100 In fairness to his Honour, I should also record that the opponent was not called on on this point. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    101 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Summons dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Claimant to pay costs of the opponent.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Antoun El Hani, has made application under s.474D Crimes Act 1900 for an inquiry or referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal with respect to a sentence imposed upon him following his plea of guilty to one count of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity of ecstasy. 
     
      
       
      The Statutory Scheme for Review 
       
       
      Applicable Statutory Provisions 
       
      
    2 On 23 February 2007, the provisions contained in Part 13A (ss.474B-474N) Crimes Act 1900 were repealed and re-enacted as Part 7 (ss.76-88) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. An application made under Part 13A before the repeal and transfer of that Part on 23 February 2007, that had not been finally determined under that Part immediately before its repeal, is taken to be an application under the corresponding provision of Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001: cl.13, Schedule 1, Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. 
     
      
    3 Accordingly, the present application falls to be determined under ss.78-79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. These provisions correspond to repealed ss.474D-474E Crimes Act 1900. There is no material difference between the provisions in the two statutes. 
     
      
    4 Sections 78-79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “78  
        Applications to Supreme Court 
         
         
          
          (1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person. 
           
           
          (2) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        79  
        Consideration of applications 
         
         
          
          (1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or 
             
             
            (b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case. 
          
         
         
          
          (3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) it appears that the matter: 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
             
              
              (i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or 
               
               
              (ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or 
               
               
              (iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or 
               
               
              (iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and 
              
             
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (3A) The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or 
             
             
            (b) the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or 
             
             
            (c) the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application. 
           
           
          (5) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).” 
          
         
        
       
       
      An Administrative Process 
       
      
    5 Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 has its origins in a legislative scheme which was an innovation in New South Wales: Kirk Group Holdings Pty Limited v WorkCover Authority of NSW (2006) 154 IR 310; [2006] NSWCA 172 at [5]. An application under s.78 does not involve a judicial proceeding: s.79(4). In determining such an application, the Court exercises administrative power: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48-50; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] 214 CLR 318 at 362 [124]. 
     
      
    6 The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). This view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley, above, at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245.  
     
      
       
      History of Proceedings 
       
      
    7 The Applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to one charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity of ecstasy, contrary to s.233B(1)(d) Customs Act 1901 (Cth). On 3 March 2003, the Applicant was sentenced by Shadbolt DCJ in the Sydney District Court to a term of imprisonment of 15 years with a non-parole period of 10 years, both periods to commence on 5 December 2001. The Applicant is eligible for release on parole on 4 December 2011. 
     
      
    8 The Applicant sought leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal with respect to sentence. On 21 May 2004, the Court granted leave to appeal, but dismissed the appeal: R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162. The grounds of appeal included the extent of the discount given to the Applicant for his plea and assistance to authorities, the impact of assistance on the Applicant’s family and parity of sentence with a co-offender. The Court of Criminal Appeal observed at [65], that no discount for future assistance was appropriate as no undertaking to give evidence under s.21E Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (cf R v Vo and Tran [2006] NSWCCA 165) had been given by the Applicant. 
     
      
    9 On 11 March 2005, the High Court of Australia refused the Applicant special leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal: El Hani v The Queen [2005] HCA Trans 146. 
     
      
    10 On 17 March 2005, Wood CJ at CL refused an application under s.474D Crimes Act 1900 upon the basis that no relevant doubt or question had been identified which would justify such a direction. His Honour recited the appellate history of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal and to the High Court of Australia and observed at [3]-[5]: 
     
      
       
        
        “3. The application is based upon the proposition that insufficient weight was given, in fixing his sentence, to the fact of his plea, his assistance to authorities, his expectation of receiving a discount for those two considerations of as much as 50%, the risk of harm to himself and his family from his co-accused or their associates, his remorse and contrition, his claim to disparity in sentencing, and his concern that he was prejudiced, in the fixing of a discount by reason of the time that was occupied in the sentencing proceedings. 
         
         
        4. Each of these matters was expressly taken into account by the Court of Criminal Appeal, which also noted that the time occupied by the sentencing proceedings largely related to the Applicant’s attempts to minimise his own role, which were not accepted by the sentencing judge or by it. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Nothing has been advanced by way of additional evidence that would throw any doubt on the findings of the sentencing judge or the Court of Criminal Appeal. In particular no new evidence has been advanced and the application amounts to nothing more than a repetition of submissions which have already been taken into account in particular by the Court of Criminal Appeal in dismissing the appeal, and by the High Court in refusing leave to appeal.” 
        
       
      
    11 The history of appeals, and a prior application under s.474D, raises for consideration the question whether the Court ought refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the present application under s.79(3) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. I will return to that issue later in this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Matters Raised on the Present Application 
       
      
    12 A number of letters and written submissions have been received from the Applicant in support of the present application. It is apparent that the Applicant has received legal advice, given the form and content of submissions on matters of fact and law which have been made on his behalf. The Applicant was given an opportunity to respond to submissions made on behalf of the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, and further submissions were made by him.  
     
      
    13 In my view, nearly all the matters advanced on behalf of the Applicant, in support of the present application, are of the same type as those considered by Wood CJ at CL in his reasons of 17 March 2005 for refusing the earlier s.474D application. The Court of Criminal Appeal considered grounds of appeal advanced by the Applicant with respect to the level of discount extended to him on sentence for assistance to law enforcement authorities and his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    14 The only additional matter relied upon by the Applicant on this application is his post-sentence (and post-appeal) assistance to Dutch authorities in February 2005. 
     
      
    15 The subject of the Applicant’s assistance to Dutch authorities was touched upon in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 21 May 2004, where Howie J (Simpson and Bell JJ agreeing) said at [77]: 
     
      
       
        
        “At the hearing of the appeal Mr Byrne tendered an affidavit as to further assistance offered by the applicant to Dutch investigators who are considering prosecution of the principals of the importation. Initially the document was tendered for the purpose of it being taken into account if this Court came to resentence the applicant. Later, Mr Byrne sought to have it received as evidence on the hearing of the appeal itself, being by way of amplification of the evidence of assistance proffered by the applicant prior to his being sentenced. On whatever basis it is received, it does not, in my opinion, avail the applicant. Again the assistance is of limited value because the applicant has not been truthful as to his own involvement. A letter from the Public Prosecutor in the Netherlands, which is part of the material now relied upon, contains the following paragraph: 
         
         
          
          ‘With the knowledge of the situation I have at this moment, I have the impression that [the applicant] has not spoken the whole truth — apparently to conceal his own role. In all I had expected more from [the applicant’s] statements. But because of his repetition, to a large extent, of what he had stated earlier his statements were nevertheless of some significance for the criminal trial in the Netherlands’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 Thus, the Applicant’s level of assistance to the Dutch authorities was referred to in the context of his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Applicant now relies upon related steps taken by him since his appeal was determined in support of the present application. In particular, the Applicant relies upon assistance given by him in February 2005. 
     
      
    17 The written submissions of the Applicant and the Commonwealth Attorney-General reveal a dispute concerning the value and frankness of the Applicant’s assistance in February 2005.  
     
      
    18 In an early letter (dated 2 June 2006) in support of the application, the Applicant raised the possibility that material might be available from a Dutch accomplice, Josef “Jeff” Faas, concerning the Applicant’s role in the importation.  
     
      
    19 No statement of Mr Faas has been provided by the Applicant in support of this application. In correspondence to the Applicant dated 12 September 2006 and 31 October 2006, the Applicant was requested to provide all material upon which he sought to rely in support of the application. The written submissions of the Applicant dated 13 October 2006, 28 October 2006 and 15 November 2006 focussed upon the Applicant’s co-operation with Dutch authorities in February 2005, and associated issues, and no material from Mr Faas was furnished.  
     
      
       
      Application Concerning Sentence for a Federal Offence 
       
      
    20 In Application of Shepherd (Supreme Court of NSW, 13 September 1996, unreported), Barr J held, at 3-6, that Part 13A Crimes Act 1900, as it then stood, did not permit a direction to be given under s.474E Crimes Act 1900 with respect to sentence only. 
     
      
    21 Thereafter, amendments were made to Part 13A by the Crimes Amendment (Review of Convictions and Sentences) Act 1996 to provide expressly for a s.474E Crimes Act 1900 direction to be given concerning sentence only: Application of Pearson (1999) 46 NSWLR 148 at 159 [45]. Sections 78 and 79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 now contain the provisions previously located in ss.474D and 474E. Accordingly, Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 makes express provision for a s.79 direction to be given concerning sentence only. 
     
      
    22 The Applicant was sentenced following his plea of guilty with respect to a federal offence under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). I sought and received written submissions from the Applicant, the Commonwealth Attorney-General and the Attorney-General for New South Wales concerning a number of legal questions raised by the application. Having considered the submissions made, I approach the application in the following way. 
     
      
    23 Firstly, the powers of the Court under s.79(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 with respect to a federal offence are confined to a referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and do not permit the direction of any inquiry under s.79(1)(a) of the Act: Application of Pearson at 164 [70]. The submissions made on behalf of the Commonwealth and New South Wales Attorneys-General contended that I should follow the decision of Wood CJ at CL in Application of Pearson in this respect. As a matter of comity, I should follow the decision of a single Judge of the Court, unless I am convinced that the judgment was wrong: Segal v Waverley Council (2005) 64 NSWLR 177 at 193 [57]. To the contrary, I am convinced that the decision of Wood CJ at CL in Application of Pearson is correct. I agree entirely with it and will follow it in this case.  
     
      
    24 Secondly, in determining whether the Applicant’s case ought be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, it is necessary to bear in mind the limits of the functions of that Court under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 upon an application for leave to appeal against sentence. If a matter is referred under s.79(1)(b), the Court of Criminal Appeal is to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person has appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and that Act applies accordingly: s.86. 
     
      
    25 The jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal is statutory: Scullion v R (Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 July 1992, unreported, BC9203142, at page 11). The review of a sentence, in the light of post-sentence conduct, has been said to be the proper province of the Executive Government and not the Court of Criminal Appeal: R v Munday (1981) 2 NSWLR 177 at 178; Douar v The Queen (2005) 159 A Crim R 154 at 163 [56]. This statement has been made expressly where reliance is sought to be placed upon post-sentence assistance to authorities on the part of an applicant: R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 257; Scullion v R at pages 1-5, 11-18;  Douar v The Queen at 174 [109].  
     
      
    26 Post-sentence assistance to authorities is not available to be taken into account by the Court of Criminal Appeal on the question of whether there was error in the sentencing process. Establishment of error is fundamental to the Court’s jurisdiction to resentence. Such assistance is available to be taken into account by the Court for resentencing purposes if, but only if, error is otherwise established: Scullion v R; R v Willard (2001) 120 A Crim R 450 at 455 [31]. 
     
      
    27 Post-sentence co-operation with authorities by a federal offender is appropriately dealt with by the Commonwealth Executive, for example, by way of an application for release on licence under s.19AP Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
     
      
    28 Section 79(2) directs attention to the issue whether a doubt or question appears “as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case”. This provision directs attention to the Applicant’s case as it stood at the time of sentence in the District Court on 3 March 2003. It is difficult to see how co-operation by the Applicant with law enforcement authorities in February 2005 can satisfy the statutory test.  
     
      
    29 Accordingly, on an application under s.78 based upon post-sentence co-operation with authorities, it is appropriate to take into account the limits of the function of the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining whether to refer the Applicant’s case to that Court. In broad terms, this conclusion reflects submissions made on behalf of the Commonwealth and New South Wales Attorneys-General, which I accept as correct. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    30 Given the appellate history of the matter, and the fact that an earlier s.474D application has been declined, I have given consideration to refusing to consider or otherwise deal with the present application under s.79(3) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. As the Applicant was advancing a further basis (his assistance in February 2005) and certain legal issues were raised by the application, I formed the view that I should consider the application. Having done so, I am entirely unpersuaded that the material and issues raised by the Applicant ought lead to any direction in his favour under s.79(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. 
     
      
    31 It does not appear, on the materials provided by the Applicant in support of this application, that there is a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). 
     
      
    32 I should observe that, even if it was open on the present application to direct an inquiry into sentence under s.79(1)(a), no basis has been demonstrated under s.79(2) for such a direction to be given. No doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case appears on the material relied upon in support of the application.  
     
      
    33 To the extent that the Applicant wishes to contend that his post-sentence conduct ought be taken into account, that is a matter for the Commonwealth Executive to consider on an application for release on licence under s.19AP Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).34 The application under s.78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 is refused.

    1 SIMPSON J: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    3 HISLOP J: The applicant pleaded guilty to the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 - Malicious wounding contrary to the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 s 35(1)(a). 
         
         
        Count 2 - Assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 s 59(1).  
         
         
        Count 3 - Assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 s 59(1).  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The maximum penalty for malicious wounding is 7 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for assault occasioning actual bodily harm is 5 years imprisonment. 
       
      
    4 On 8 June 2006 the applicant was sentenced for those offences in the District Court as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 - Imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years to commence on 28 January 2006 and expire on 27 January 2009; 
         
         
        Count 2 - Imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years and 3 months to commence on 28 January 2008 and expire on 27 April 2010; 
         
         
        Count 3 - Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 6 months to commence on 28 January 2010 and expire on 27 July 2010 with the balance of the term, 18 months, to expire on 27 January 2012. 
        
       
       
      The effective overall sentence is 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. 
      
    5 The victim of each of the offences was Ms Chatfield who at the time of the first offence was 27 years of age and had been living with the applicant for approximately 12 months. The applicant was born on 13 September 1976 and was of aboriginal heritage. 
     
      
    6 The facts constituting each offence, as found by the sentencing judge, were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 - The applicant and Ms Chatfield attended a party during the afternoon of 26 August 2005. Both consumed alcohol and the applicant admitted to also having had a couple of cones of marijuana. After leaving the party Ms Chatfield and the applicant were walking home when an argument developed. Ms Chatfield was ahead of the applicant who was demanding to know who she was “hanging around for”. He produced a knife with a blade 10 to 15 centimetres long, ran toward Ms Chatfield and stabbed her in the back with it. She sustained a wound some 3 centimetres long and 1 centimetre deep, which later required 6 stitches at Tamworth Base Hospital. The applicant was arrested and charged. He was held, bail refused, until released on bail on 17 October 2005. On 13 February 2006 his bail conditions were changed to include a condition that he was not to contact or approach Ms Chatfield. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 2 - On 11 March 2006 Ms Chatfield was walking in a park when she was approached from behind by the applicant who struck her on the head with a stick measuring some 1 to 1.5 metres long. The attack was unprovoked. Ms Chatfield sustained lacerations to the back of her head, the larger laceration was 7 centimetres long and required 5 stitches, the smaller one was 3 centimetres long and required two stitches. 
         
         
        Count 3 - On the afternoon of 18 March 2006 the applicant went to Ms Chatfield’s house and an argument took place. The applicant then kicked Ms Chatfield a number of times and she attempted to go outside the house. He grabbed her by the hair and pulled her back inside and again kicked her a number of times. She was able to escape and the police were called. The extent of the bruising to Ms Chatfield’s face is readily discernible in two photographs which were exhibited at the sentencing hearing. 
        
       
      
    7 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against sentence on the grounds that: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The fixed terms for count 1 (malicious wounding) and count 2 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm) are manifestly excessive. 
         
         
        (2) His Honour erred in failing properly to apply principles relating to totality in sentencing for multiple counts. 
         
         
        (3) His Honour erred in limiting a finding of special circumstances only to the consideration of maintaining a seventy-five percent ratio between the total non-parole period and the effective head sentence. 
         
         
        (4) The overall sentences are manifestly excessive, in particular as to the effective non-parole period. 
        
       
       
      Ground One - The fixed terms for count 1 (malicious wounding) and count 2 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm) are manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    8 It was submitted for the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) that the fixed terms of 3 years (Count 1) and 2 years 3 months (Count 2) were minimum terms as required by section 44(1) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999. The Crown accepted that this submission was correct (see in this regard  
        Thomas 
         (1993) 65 A Crim R 269,  
        R v Zreika  
        [2003] NSWCCA 47,  
        R v Romano 
         [2004] NSWCCA 380, and  
        R v Dickinson  
        [2005] NSWCCA 284). 
         
         
        (b) his Honour’s starting point, after allowing for a discount of 25% for the early pleas of guilty and a parole period corresponding with the statutory ratio must have been 5 years 4 months in respect of Count 1 and 4 years in respect of Count 2. 
         
         
        (c) the maximum penalty for the Count 1 offence was imprisonment for 7 years and for the Count 2 offence, 5 years. 
         
         
        (d) his Honour’s starting point for sentencing on Counts 1 and 2, having regard to all of the circumstances, was disproportionate to the maximum penalties and demonstrated manifest excess. 
        
       
      
    9 In my opinion the sentences for counts 1 and 2 demonstrate a disproportion to the maximum penalties such as to demonstrate manifest excess. Accordingly I would uphold this ground of appeal. I would substitute fixed terms of 2 years and 6 months (count 1) and 1 year and 9 months (count 2) respectively. Having regard to my ultimate conclusion in this matter it is unnecessary to provide further reasons for this conclusion. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two - His Honour erred in failing properly to apply principles relating to totality in sentencing for multiple counts. 
       
      
    10 His Honour, in quantifying sentence, first fixed an appropriate sentence for each of the offences. He then proceeded to consider questions of cumulation, concurrence and totality. This accorded with the principles in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 [45]. I perceive no error of principle in his Honour’s approach.  
     
      
       
      Ground Three - His Honour erred in limiting a finding of special circumstances only to the consideration of maintaining a seventy-five percent ratio between the total non-parole period and the effective head sentence. 
       
      
    11 His Honour concluded that, to have proper regard to the overall degree of criminality involved, it was appropriate that the sentences should accumulate to 6 years. This rendered it necessary to readjust the non-parole period for count 3 to ensure the statutory non-parole/parole ratio was preserved. 
     
      
    12 His Honour did not otherwise make a finding as to special circumstances. It was submitted he erred in failing to make a specific finding as to whether the applicant’s rehabilitation prospects gave rise to special circumstances meriting a further adjustment of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    13 Although his Honour did not otherwise make a specific finding as to special circumstances it is clear he did not regard the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation as justifying such a finding. In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted the applicant had had a chronic cannabis addiction since his teenage years. He had experimented with harder drugs and petrol. He had a problem with alcohol. His Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        … he committed offences in 2000 and 2001 including an 18 month sentence for armed with intent to commit an indictable offence. His parole was conditioned to undertake drug and alcohol counselling. In 2003 he received a 22 month sentence suspended with bond conditions that he attend drug and alcohol and anger management counselling as required…Despite his assertion of growing maturity, Mr Widders failed attempt at rehabilitation with the Roy Thorne Centre in 2005 – resulting in a return to alcohol, drugs and violence – does not give this Court any confidence that this control is developing. Having listened carefully to Mr Widders as he gave evidence, I am satisfied that he has no real insight into the seriousness of his violent behaviour and that any steps he has taken toward rehabilitation are more token than motivational.  
        
       
      
    14 It was well open to his Honour to make these findings and well within his discretion not to find special circumstances. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground Four - The overall sentences are manifestly excessive, in particular as to the effective non-parole period. 
       
      
    15 Each of the subject offences was committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty. The objective seriousness of each of the offences was substantial. A weapon was involved in the first 2 offences. 
     
      
    16 The applicant, as his Honour observed, is a repeat offender who has demonstrated low commitment to abandoning his violent conduct toward other persons. He has a lengthy criminal record extending from 1993. That record includes assault charges in relation to both citizens and police (12) and offences of malicious wounding, damage to property (5), stealing, larceny, receiving, break enter and steal, offensive conduct (3), driving while disqualified, midrange PCA and other miscellaneous matters. 
     
      
    17 In sentencing the applicant his Honour concluded that to have proper regard to the overall degree of criminality involved, it was appropriate that the sentences should accumulate to 6 years. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        The community rightly condemns crimes of violence. Those who persist in such activities turning their backs upon offers of rehabilitation can expect to receive punishment that seriously takes into account the need for personal deterrence. For those who are tempted to also commit such crimes, the sentence should also provide general deterrence. 
        
       
       
        
        …There is really little or nothing in the circumstance of the Applicant’s ongoing criminal activity that provides much basis for leniency other than the discount for the pleas. 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour’s findings were well open to him and the overall sentence imposed was within his sentencing discretion. In my opinion the effective overall sentence of a non parole period of 4 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 18 months is not manifestly excessive. I would not disturb the overall sentence. 
     
      
    19 Accordingly, whilst I would uphold the appeal in respect of the sentences imposed for counts 1 and 2 the overall result will remain the same.  
     
      
    20 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
    1. Grant leave to appeal; 
     
      
    2. Allow the appeal as to counts 1 and 2;

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    3 HISLOP J: The applicant pleaded guilty to a charge that between 4 September 2003 and 25 September 2003 at Kings Cross and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales he did supply a prohibited drug, namely, heroin, contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 s 25(1). The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of 2,000 penalty units. 
     
      
    4 On 11 September 2006 the applicant was sentenced for that offence by Marien DCJ to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 16 months commencing on 26 January 2006 and expiring on 25 May 2007 and a total sentence of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment commencing on 26 January 2006 and expiring on 25 July 2008. 
     
      
    5 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against that sentence on the ground that “the sentence imposed upon the applicant’s co-offender gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.”  
     
      
    6 The facts giving rise to the offence were that in September 2003 the police received information that a heroin distribution network was operating within the Kings Cross area. The principal organiser of that network was a Mr Vu. He employed a manager and three street level runners who distributed the heroin on the streets of Kings Cross. Investigation identified the street distributors as the applicant, his de facto, Ms Burrows, and Mr Tufa. 
     
      
    7 The applicant, Ms Burrows and Mr Tufa pleaded guilty to the same charge and were sentenced at the same time by Judge Marien. The sentence imposed upon Ms Burrows, the most active participant in the supply of heroin, was a non-parole period of 20 months imprisonment and a total sentence of 3 years. Mr Tufa was sentenced to a non-parole period of 19 months imprisonment and a total sentence of 2 years and 9 months. His Honour took into account in sentencing Mr Tufa an offence of larceny on a Form 1. 
     
      
    8 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the differential in sentence of only 3 months between that imposed upon Mr Tufa and that imposed upon the applicant (in relation to both the head sentence and the non-parole period), gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the applicant’s part. It was further submitted that when proper weight was given to the subjective and objective features of the applicant’s case a differential of more than 3 months was required to accommodate issues of parity and proportionality, factors which were not expressly canvassed by the sentencing judge. Accordingly, it was submitted that another sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
    9 In Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 617 Brennan J held: 
     
      
       
        
        The sentencing of co-offenders always requires a comparison of their conduct and antecedents. The imposition of comparable sentences upon co-offenders whose respective conduct and antecedents warrant disparate sentences is unjust. Similarly the imposition of disparate sentences upon co-offenders whose conduct and antecedents are comparable is unjust. A justified sense of unfair treatment is produced in either case. 
        
       
      
    10 In Postiglione v R (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 323 Gummow J said: 
     
      
       
        
        The principle for which  
        Lowe 
         is authority appears to be that the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes where the difference between the two sentences is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    11 A comparison of the subjective features of the applicant and Mr Tufa, in short, reveals the applicant was born on 5 October 1971, Mr Tufa on 5 March 1980; each suffered a degree of disruption during their early years; each at the time of the offence was addicted to heroin; the applicant during the period between the offence and sentence had taken effective steps toward rehabilitation, Mr Tufa had not been successful thus far in his rehabilitation. The applicant had a minor criminal record and had not been in custody for any prior offence. Mr Tufa had a lengthy record for relatively minor offences and had spent time in custody. Neither had any prior convictions for drug offences. The applicant was sentenced on the basis of the supply of between 10 - 15 grams of heroin during the relevant period. Mr Tufa was sentenced on the basis of the supply of between 20 - 30 grams and his possession of 4.7 grams of heroin at the time of arrest was taken into account. In Mr Tufa’s case the Court also took into account the larceny charge on the Form 1. 
     
      
    12 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the difference between the amount of heroin supplied by Mr Tufa compared to that supplied by the applicant was sufficient to explain the 3 months difference in the respective sentences. I do not agree. The amount of drugs involved is but one consideration. As his Honour observed:  
     
      
       
        
        The offence of supply heroin is an offence of extreme gravity. … In relation to each of the offenders there was absolutely nothing before me to indicate that each did not act voluntarily and willingly and knowingly in a clearly organised highly criminal drug distribution network … Each was an active street dealer in heroin.  
        
       
      
    13 It was also submitted on behalf of the applicant that the differences in his subjective case compared to that of Mr Tufa were such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to his sentence. Emphasis was placed upon the applicant’s rehabilitation and future prospects compared to those of Mr Tufa and the extent of Mr Tufa’s criminal record compared to that of the applicant. There is no doubt that in relation to these matters any comparison was favourable to the applicant. 
     
      
    14 However the applicant was considerably older than Mr Tufa, his addiction had been for a greater period and his rehabilitation had occurred only since his arrest in respect of this matter. His Honour found that Mr Tufa’s “future prospects were favourable”. 
     
      
    15 In sentencing for offences of this kind, whilst subjective features are relevant, greater emphasis is placed upon the objective criminality and the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
    16 His Honour sentenced all offenders at the one time. He gave lengthy consideration to all relevant factors in relation to each. In these circumstances this Court should be cautious before determining that one of the offenders has a justifiable sense of grievance just because of the different sentencing outcomes – Regina v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47.17 In my opinion the differences between the factors applicable to the applicant and to Mr Tufa were adequately taken into account by the 3 month differential in their respective sentences and are not such as to give rise to a marked discrepancy in sentence such as to justify the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
    18 In my opinion it has not been established that some other sentence, less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed. Accordingly, whilst I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    19 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal granted. 
         
         
        2. Appeal dismissed.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 THE COURT: On 9 December 2005, following a trial that commenced on 5 December, the appellant was convicted by a jury of a single count of aggravated indecent assault. On 3 February 2006 Geraghty DCJ sentenced him to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 21 months, commencing on the day it was imposed, and a balance of term of seven months. 
     
      
    2 The appellant now appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
    3 The count on which the appellant was convicted was the second of three on the indictment. The first, to which it was an alternative, was of sexual intercourse with a child under ten years. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on this count and thus proceeded to the second, alternative, count. Both of these counts alleged offences said to have been committed on 15 April 2004. The third count was of aggravated indecent assault, alleged to have been committed between 14 February 2004 and 15 April 2004. At the direction of the trial judge, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty to this count. 
     
      
    4 What follows is an account of the facts and circumstances alleged by the Crown. It should not be taken to represent any concluded findings of fact. 
     
      
    5 The appellant was the proprietor of a domestic renovation business. In April 2004, with the assistance of two employees, he was working on the renovation of an apartment owned by the complainant’s mother, to whom we will refer (in order to preserve the complainant’s anonymity) as SA. 
     
      
    6 SA, the complainant (then aged seven and a half years), and complainant’s 19 year-old brother, CA, were all temporarily living in the apartment. The complainant and SA shared one bedroom; the second was occupied by CA. 
     
      
    7 On 15 April 2004 SA was unwell and spent the day in bed, in the room ordinarily occupied by CA. It was school holidays. Having arisen early, the complainant became tired and lay down on her mother’s bed and fell asleep. Later, she was in the living room. The appellant gave instructions to his employees, and then led the complainant into her mother’s bedroom. He said he was going to make her feel better, because she felt ill. He said he would give her a massage. The two entered the bedroom. The appellant closed the door. He asked where the complainant was in pain and she pointed to her stomach. The appellant told her that he was a doctor. 
     
      
    8 The complainant lay on the bed. The appellant patted her on the stomach, asking if it hurt. The appellant put his hand under her clothing, and touched her on the vagina. He inserted “about two” fingers, and “fiddled around” with her vagina. 
     
      
    9 The complainant jumped up from the bed and terminated the encounter, saying that she thought that that was enough. The appellant accepted that. 
     
      
    10 The complainant immediately went to her brother’s room, where her mother was in the bed. She told her mother what had happened. CA entered the room shortly after. The complainant told him the same as she had told her mother. CA expressed the view that it was “really wrong” and that SA should report the matter to police. 
     
      
    11 SA did so, and police arrived at the apartment at about 6.15 pm. By this time the appellant and his employees had left for the day. Senior Constable Maclay asked the complainant what had happened. She said -  
     
      
       
        
        Tony took me into the bedroom and played with my private parts. 
        
       
      
    12 A Detective Brazel arrived, and telephoned Dr Mark Johnston, a medical practitioner at the Child Protection Unit at the Sydney Children’s Hospital. In answer to a question whether her vagina was sore the complainant answered affirmatively; when asked to describe how it felt, she said -  
     
      
       
        
        Really really sore. 
        
       
       
      She said that it had hurt when she went to the toilet after the incident. 
       
      
    13 The complainant was taken to the Sydney Children’s Hospital where Dr Johnston took a history, and then examined her. He reported -  
     
      
       
        
        When speaking about the events of today, [the complainant] said she was taken to the bedroom by the male offender and told to lie down. 
        
       
       
      He recorded that the complainant said that the appellant had told her he was a doctor. Using the complainant’s words, Dr Johnstone recorded that the appellant had -  
       
       
        
        … put his finger inside me. 
        
       
      
    14 On examination Dr Johnston found - 
     
      
       
        
        … no evidence of bruising, abrasion or laceration on the labia, on the fourchette or the vestibule … the hymen was well seen. There was no evidence of any recent injury to the hymen. Examination of the anal area was normal. 
        
       
      
    15 In short, there were no abnormal findings. 
     
      
    16 On 16 April 2004 the appellant was arrested by police and subsequently interviewed. On arrest he was told of the nature of the offence in respect of which he had been arrested, and cautioned. He said -  
     
      
       
        
        I not touch anyone. 
        
       
      
    17 He initially declined to accompany police, saying he had a business to run. He was, however, conveyed to the Burwood Police Station. En route to the police station he said -  
     
      
       
        
        She was sick. I got some lemonade and I felt her stomach. I did not do anything wrong. 
        
       
       
      He was again advised of his right to silence, and of the allegation. He spoke to his solicitor. He was then asked if he was prepared to be interviewed and he replied -  
       
       
        
        Yeah, sure, I’ve not done anything. 
        
       
      
    18 In an electronically recorded interview he confirmed his denial while travelling to the police station, and confirmed that he had agreed that he had touched the complainant’s stomach because she was feeling sick. He said that after having had the lemonade the complainant said she felt much better. He said that she then -  
     
      
       
        
        Started lying in the room, like little kid, jumping on me, lying. 
        
       
       
      He said that she cuddled him and ran to him and that he couldn’t “ 
      push her away, she’s a little innocent baby 
      ”. 
       
      
    19 When given an opportunity to comment on the specific allegation the appellant said -  
     
      
       
        
        No way. I’d cut my hand if I’d done that. No way … I never done nothing, what is there to say. 
        
       
       
      He denied ever having told the complainant or any member of her family that he was a doctor, saying -  
       
       
        
        I am not a doctor, how I can tell I’m a doctor. 
        
       
       
      He repeated that the complainant used to run and jump on him, and talk to him, and played like a little girl. 
       
      
    20 He gave an account of his movements on a day that he remembered that SA had been sick in bed. He denied that on that day he had ever pressed the complainant’s stomach and denied that he ever put his hands inside her pants. 
     
      
    21 At the conclusion of the Crown case the Crown conceded that, on 4 March 2005, while watching the video of her interview with a solicitor of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the complainant had said -  
     
      
       
        
        He didn’t really call me. He grabbed my arm and then he – and then he said ‘come on’. 
        
       
      
    22 At another point a little further in the video, the complainant stated -  
     
      
       
        
        It [meaning the bedroom door] was also locked. He locked it so I couldn’t get out. 
        
       
      
    23 She also said that she had been upset and frightened because, while they were in the bedroom, the appellant had told her not to tell anybody. She said that she was trying to get out of the room. 
     
      
    24 Presumably, these concessions were made because they involved matters of detail which the complainant had not mentioned in her initial interview. 
     
      
    25 In this respect it is of some significance that the evidence of the complainant was given, pursuant to s14 of the Evidence (Children) Act 1997, by playing a video recording of an interview of her by police. This occurred the day after the date of the allegations, 16 April 2004, at about 1.15 pm. 
     
      
    26 The appellant did not give evidence in the trial. He relied upon his denials to police and called evidence of good character. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    27 Four grounds of appeal were pleaded and argued, of which the first three all concerned a direction given to the jury by the trial judge. These grounds were framed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1 The learned trial judge erred in law in inviting the jury to consider whether there was a conspiracy between the complainant and her mother and whether there was any established motive between the complainant and/or her mother to lie. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2 The learned trial judge erred in declining to discharge the jury on the application of defence counsel following the directions which are subject of Ground 1. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3 The trial miscarried due to the inadequacy of the redirection to redress the prejudice to the fairness of the trial which had been caused by remarks of the learned trial judge. 
        
       
      
    28 At a point about half way through a relatively short summing up, the trial judge directed the jury as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        Well, can I say, you must realise, common sense tells us, does it not, that everyone’s memory is fallible, faulty, and some people’s memories are more faulty that others. Some people have good memories and some have bad, to state the bleeding obvious. As time passes, memories can fail as to some details. Events happen very quickly when they unfold, particularly dramatic events, and no, we do not have a video recording – you heard the Crown saying that, nothing is recorded, we have only our memory to rely on as to what happens. So she said she was ‘really really really really upset’. Well, what does that mean? Do you, because of all these inconsistencies, conclude that [the complainant] is lying and unable to maintain her narrative? Or do you regard it as just normal, that there are always some inconsistencies? Is [the complainant] and her mother conspiring to make up a story, and if so why? Are they unable to maintain the story they have agreed upon? Whatever happens to us, whatever happens, we never get the details exactly right. There is always some variation. And does that consideration, when placed in this context, result in you feeling uncomfortable or are you uncomfortable. Now ‘comfortable’ or ‘uncomfortable’ is not the test. The test is whether you have a reasonable doubt. No the test is whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the elements of the offences are proven. 
        
       
      
    29 Counsel for the appellant protested, and sought a discharge of the jury. As a result, his Honour gave the jury this further direction - 
     
      
       
        
        Now, there is an important matter I need to correct. That is what we have been discussing here while you have been waiting. I need to correct something I said to you before lunch. It was wrong, and if you attend to it you could fall into error. Therefore you must pay attention to what I say now in order that this matter be corrected. I said to you, when I was talking about inconsistency and the obscurities of various versions and so forth, I said to you, what were you going to make of it? I talked about memory and about how memory is fallible and so forth, and then I said in that context that [the complainant] and her mother, you may think, conspired to make up a story but were unable to maintain it. Remember me saying that? You are to ignore that, completely, please, for this reason. It has never been suggested by the accused, or by his counsel, that there was any motive for lying. It has never being (sic) suggested that the mother and the daughter made up lies together – that has not been something that has even been considered, so you must not speculate on that basis, nor must you guess about that. It is not a consideration that you should engage in. It is an impermissible thought process for you to go down that path because if you do go down that path, it tends to reverse the onus. The onus is always on the Crown, and if you go down that path, you might think that unless Mr Boulattouf has persuaded you that there was a motive for lie (sic), unless he has persuaded you that, then you will accept the complainant’s evidence. You must not think in that way. It has never been suggested. There is no onus on him and so I would like you, I direct you, to put that matter completely out of your mind. It was a question I should not have posed to you, and it is one that I direct you to ignore. 
        
       
      
    30 As at trial, both sides approached the appeal on the understanding that what the judge said initially was a misdirection. It is well established that such a direction ought not to be made because it is apt to lead a jury to believe that the burden of disproving such conclusions lies on the accused: McKinney v The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 468. 
     
      
    31 As at trial, the two sides disagreed whether the misdirection was incapable of correction so that the only solution was a discharge of the jury. Counsel for the appellant submitted on appeal that the invitation to reason about whether the complainant might have lied and whether she and her mother might have had any motive to conspire to lie must so have impressed itself on the minds of the jury as to be impossible to remove. It was not simply that the redirection was inadequate; no adequate redirection could possibly have been given. 
     
      
    32 In R v Lansdell, a judgment of this Court given on 22 May 1995, Simpson J said this at 7 -  
     
      
       
        
        The system necessarily places a great deal of faith in the ability of a jury to accept, and follow, the directions of a trial judge, even in circumstances where it might appear to the jury that they are asked to act against the dictates of common sense. Equally, however, the system recognises that there are bounds beyond which a jury cannot be expected, or asked, to go. For this reason, the criminal appeal courts have developed the notion encapsulated in the commonly used phrase ""no direction to the jury could have cured the damage ....."" Implicit in this notion is the recognition that there are occasions when the legal system accepts that a jury will not, or cannot be expected to, comply with the directions of a trial judge.  
         
        
       
      
    33 Although counsel referred to a number of cases which have dealt with a direction like the one now complained of or with a comment to the same effect, for example R v Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520; R v Fuge (2001) 123 A Crim R 310 and R v Smith [2000] NSWCCA 468, none suggests that such a direction cannot be effectively withdrawn. The argument really was that the intractability of the problem was self-evident.  
     
      
    34 We do not regard the misdirection as falling into that category of cases in which the jury cannot be expected to comply with a direction to put the offending matter out of their minds. In our opinion the trial judge was entitled to refuse to discharge the jury. As a consequence, he was obliged to give such further direction as was necessary to ensure that they should not resort to the impermissible process of reasoning. In doing so, his Honour was entitled to expect that the jury would follow the further direction and put the original one out of their minds: R v Marsland Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 17 July 1991, unreported; R v Lansdell. See also the remarks of McHugh J in Gilbert v The Queen [2007] HCA 15 at [31] – [32].  
     
      
    35 The alternative case on appeal, the third ground, was that the redirection was insufficient to cure the ill. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the redirection did not make the point that people lie for all sorts of reasons and that sometimes those reasons are not discovered. Reference was made to the judgment of Sperling J in Jovanovic at 542. Then it was submitted that the redirection was unclear, that it inevitably reiterated that the appellant had not adduced evidence why the complainant had made her complaint and that it did not explain that the complainant’s account gained no legitimate credibility from the absence of evidence of motive. Reference was made to Palmer v The Queen (1998) 193 CLR 1 at 9.  
     
      
    36 We reject the submission that the redirection was unclear. His Honour first told the jury that he was about to correct something he had said, then that they could fall into error if they attended to it, then that they needed to pay attention. His Honour reminded the jury of the subject-matter and told them plainly that they were to ignore completely what he had said. Then he explained why that was so, that such a process of reasoning was impermissible because it tended to reverse the onus of proof. Then his Honour explained what that expression meant and reminded the jury that the onus of proof lay always on the Crown. His Honour concluded by repeating that there was no onus of proof on the accused and that they should put completely out of their minds what he had previously said.  
     
      
    37 In our opinion no disadvantage accrued to the appellant by the reminder that he had not suggested that the complainant had any motive to lie. We reject the submission that “the redirection inevitably reiterated that the appellant did not (and presumably therefore could not) place before the Court any evidence as to why the complainant made the complaint against him”. The redirection did no such thing. It did not mention any lack of evidence. It dealt only with the absence of any suggestion that there was a motive for lying or conspiring.  
     
      
    38 It is correct to say that his Honour did not in terms tell the jury either that “people lie for all sorts of reasons and that sometimes those reasons are not discovered” or that the “complainant’s account gained no legitimate credibility from the absence of evidence of motive”, but there is no general requirement for a trial judge to do so and his Honour was not asked to redirect in those words.  
     
      
    39 The progress of the matter after the redirection suggests that the jury were not troubled about the relevant part of the evidence. They asked a number of questions about the evidence of a number of witnesses, none of whom, apparently, was the complainant or her mother.  
     
      
    40 It seems to us that the redirection was apt to remove from the minds of the jury any thought of reasoning by considering whether the complainant or her mother had any motive to lie or conspire. Nothing that happened afterwards suggests that the jury did not heed the redirection. We reject the first, second and third grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    41 The fourth ground of appeal is as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        Ground 4 The verdict of guilty in relation to count 2 is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence and to the verdicts of not guilty in relation to counts 1 and 2 or otherwise represents a miscarriage of justice.  
        
       
      
    42 The second reference in this ground to count 2 was apparently made in error. The substance of the ground is an asserted inconsistency between the acquittal on the first count and the conviction on the second. The argument runs this way. The Crown case on the first and second counts depended entirely on the evidence of the complainant. The first count charged penile penetration of the vagina and the second an indecent assault constituted by a touching of the vagina with the fingers. The only relevant distinction between them was penetration, which was a requisite of the first count but not of the second. The unequivocal evidence of the complainant was of penetration. The jury had a reasonable doubt about that and acquitted the appellant on the first count. Yet they convicted him on the second. Since the jury had a reasonable doubt about penetration, and the complainant described no touching other than a touching during the act of penetration, they were bound also to have a reasonable doubt about the indecent touching. The verdicts were inconsistent.  
     
      
    43 It is not usual for the Crown to charge an assault alternatively to a count depending on penetration unless there is some doubt in the mind of the prosecutor whether the anticipated evidence will be sufficient to make out the principal charge. The reason for the Crown’s caution seems to have been the anticipated evidence of Senior Constable Maclay about what the complainant had told her and extracted above. The complainant did not mention penetration to Constable Maclay.  
     
      
    44 The Crown Prosecutor opened to the jury on the conversation with Constable Maclay. In introducing the counts to the jury the Crown Prosecutor explained that the first involved sexual intercourse by digital penetration and that the second was an alternative count. The Crown put it that if the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was actual penetration of the vagina they could consider the alternative charge of indecent assault.  
     
      
    45 Constable Maclay gave evidence as anticipated. There was nothing equivocal, however, about the complainant’s evidence of the event. The principal part of her evidence in chief was adduced by the playing of a videotape of an interview she had had with investigating police officers on 14 July 2004, two days after the events. There were these questions and answers -  
     
      
       
        
        Q 262 
          
        … 
        What did Tony do? 
         
        A He touched my private part. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q271 …So you said he touched you on, on your private part. How did he touch you on the private part? 
         
        A He put his hand under my clothes and then he touched it. 
         
         
        Q272 He put his hand under your clothes and he touched it. 
         
        A And he put it inside it. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q273 He put it in, sorry? 
         
        A He put it inside it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q274 O.K. What, he put it inside what? 
         
        A My private part. He put his fingers inside it and fiddled around with it.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q278  
          
        O.K. O.K. 
          
        When you, when you said that he puts his hand 
         
          
          under your, under your pants whereabouts, whereabouts were you? Were you lying, were you sitting or standing? 
          
         
        A I, I was lying on the bed. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q307 O.K. And then what happened when he put his hand, what 
         
        happened when he put his hand under your underpants?  
         
        A Then he started touching my private part with his fingers. 
         
         
        Q308 O.K. How, how do you know, how do you know it was his 
         
        fingers? 
         
        A Because I could feel them. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q314 Before you jumped up and you said he put his finger 
         
        inside your private part what did he do, what did he do 
         
        with his fingers inside your private part?  
        
       
      A Moved it around. 
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q316 Do you know how many fingers he, he used? 
         
        A About two.  
         
        
       
      
    46 It was put to the complainant in cross-examination that the events did not happen. She was adamant that they did.  
     
      
    47 When the Crown Prosecutor gave her closing address there was no mention of the alternative charge. Having dealt with what she anticipated would be put to the jury as inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant, the Crown Prosecutor pointed out that they were all peripheral to the main event – matters such as whether the complainant’s mother was making beds or whether she was having coffee or whether she was up at all, being ill. The central submission was that there were no inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence about the event the subject of the first count. The Crown Prosecutor told the jury that they could “safely convict”, and plainly the reference was to the first count, not the second.  
     
      
    48 As expected, defence counsel drew attention to a host of what were said to be inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant, but none of them was put forward as raising a reasonable doubt about penetration rather than indecent assault. The submission was that the jury would have a reasonable doubt about whether anything of a sexual nature had taken place.  
     
      
    49 His Honour summed up. Having enumerated the elements of the first count his Honour told the jury that if they were not satisfied of that, there was an alternative account. Later on his Honour returned to the subject and said this -  
     
      
       
        
        Now, the first charge is one of sexual intercourse. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
          
        …sexual intercourse means sexual connection occasioned by the penetration to any extent of the genitalia of a female person by any part the body of another person. That is how it is defined. So it is not just what we might consider to be penile penetration, but digital penetration also fills the definition, so that if you find that you can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt when 
         (the complainant)  
        tells you that on this occasion the accused put his finger in her vagina and moved it around, then that fully constitutes the definition of ""sexual intercourse"". 
         
         
        As to the question of ""indecent assault"" in the alternative, the accused has been charged with assaulting 
         (the complainant)  
        and at the same time committing an act of indecency. I have spoken to you of what an act of indecency is. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Touching the genitalia has been considered by the law as an act of indecency, so that if you accept what  
        (the complainant) 
         tells you happened, then it would in law constitute an act of decency, if you need to go to the alternative count. 
         
        
       
      
    50 Of course, what his Honour could not do was refer to the respective cases on the circumstances in which the jury might acquit on the first count and convict on the second. That was a topic neither counsel had dealt with.  
     
      
    51 The jury asked a number of questions after retiring. In the first place they dealt with evidentiary matters. Later on they asked this question -  
     
      
       
        
        Can we please get clarification on what an act of indecency is by law?  
        
       
      
    52 His Honour responded with a reiterated and somewhat expanded version of what he had already said. It is unexceptionable and we do not need to deal with the content of it. As before, however, there was no reference to the circumstances in which, on the case put forward by either side, the jury might have a doubt about the first count but not the second.  
     
      
    53 The jury were asked to retire again and the debate continued. In the course of it the Crown said this -  
     
      
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: So they do not have to find an assault and then find a separate act of indecency and the case is, the Crown case is that they consider the alternative verdict only if they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that penetration of her vagina occurred, and the indecent act is the touching of the genitalia region… 
        
       
      
    54 His Honour recalled the jury and continued as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        The Crown relies on exactly the same act to constitute the assault and the indecent act. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused digitally penetrated the vagina of the victim, then you will find him ""guilty"". If you are not satisfied that he digitally penetrated her vagina you will find him ""not guilty"" on that count. You will move onto the next count then. If you are satisfied that he touched her vagina, that would constitute an act of indecency, and you will find him ""guilty"" on that alternative count. If you find that he did not touch her vagina, then you will find him ""not guilty"" on that account. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he penetrated, with his finger, the vagina of the victim - ""guilty"". If not satisfied about that, beyond reasonable doubt - ""not guilty"". Then you will move to the next. Are you satisfied that he touched her on 15 April on the vagina? That would constitute an act of indecency, so if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about that, you would find him ""guilty"". If you are not satisfied about that, then you will find him ""not guilty"" on that count also. 
         
        
       
      
    55 There is an initial attractiveness about the appellant’s assertion that the verdicts were inconsistent. However, they must be seen in the light of the way the trial was conducted. The Crown Prosecutor had an initial concern about the quality of the evidence that led her to include the alternative count in the Indictment. Whether that was justified needs no examination here. But the trial thereafter was not conducted by the Crown or the defence on any basis that would entitle the jury to distinguish between the two counts. Putting it in our own words, either the jury would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a sexual event or they would not. The elements of the two counts were correctly explained. The jury were told that the counts were charged in the alternative, but they were never told how to distinguish between the two, on what evidence or on what argument. That was not done because it could not be done.  
     
      
    56 It seems to us that once the trial advanced past the stage of the evidence and the arguments on it, the second count really had no part to play. The jury were simply left with the evidence of the complainant, whom they obviously believed, and a simple choice between alternatives. Uninstructed about how to exercise that choice, they must have regarded themselves as entitled to convict on either the first or the second count. They had reason to have some sympathy for the appellant. He raised his good character. He called evidence from people who were prepared to entrust young children to his care and did not consider him a danger.  
     
      
    57 In our opinion the most probable explanation for the result is that the jury considered themselves entitled to deal mercifully with the appellant and convict him of the lesser rather than the greater offence and that that is what happened. This ground of appeal has not been made good.  
     
      
    58 The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against the sentence, though his application may be no more than a formality. No submissions were made to suggest that the sentence fell above the proper range of discretion of the trial judge or that it was otherwise infected with error. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for ten years. The standard non-parole period was five years. A sentence of twenty-eight months, comprising a non-parole period of twenty-one months and a balance of term of seven months seems to us unremarkable in the circumstances.  
     
      
    59 We make the following orders -  
     
      
       
        
        1. The appeal against the conviction is dismissed.  
        
       
       
        
        2. Leave is granted to appeal against the sentence but the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: This is a Crown appeal against the asserted manifest inadequacy of sentences imposed upon the respondent in the District Court by Hughes DCJ on 7 December 2006, following the respondent’s pleas of guilty to six counts on an indictment. The respondent asked that a further four offences listed on a Form 1 be taken into account pursuant to Part 3 Division 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the “Sentencing Procedure Act”). 
     
      
    2 The first count on the indictment was for an offence of assault with intent to rob whilst in company, committed on 14 November 2005. The remaining counts were all of robbery in company, representing offences committed, respectively, on 28 November 2005, 29 November 2005, 3 December 2005 and two on 4 December 2005. Each of the six offences carries, pursuant to s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. 
     
      
    3 The offences on the Form 1 were of offensive language, custody of a knife in a public place, entering a restricted area without possessing a ticket (an offence against the Rail Safety (General) Regulation 2003), and refusing or failing to comply with a direction by a police officer (an offence against the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002). All were committed on 8 December 2005. 
     
      
    4 In respect of the first count on the indictment Hughes DCJ imposed a total term of imprisonment of three years, made up of a non-parole period of one year, and a balance of term of two years. 
     
      
    5 In respect of the third, his Honour imposed a total term of imprisonment also of three years, but divided equally into a non-parole period of one year and six months, and a balance of term of one year and six months. In respect of the remaining counts, numbered 2, 4, 5 and 6, his Honour imposed terms of imprisonment of three years and nine months, each made up of a non-parole period of two years and one month, and a balance of term of one year and eight months. At the request of the Crown, at the end of the sentencing exercise, his Honour stated that he had taken into account the Form 1 offences, but did not specify in respect of which count on the indictment he did so. 
     
      
    6 His Honour specified that each of the six sentences was to commence on 8 December 2005; that is, all six sentences are to be served concurrently. Accordingly, the total term of imprisonment to be served is of a non-parole period of two years and one month and balance of term of one year and eight months. 
     
      
    7 On behalf of the Crown it was submitted that these sentences were, in total, manifestly inadequate, and that discrete error, in four respects, can be discerned in the sentencing process. I will return shortly to deal with the Crown submissions. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    8 All offences the subject of the indictment were committed over a six week period commencing on 14 November 2005 and concluding on 4 December 2005. All were essentially of the same kind, and of the kind seen far too often in this Court. They involved the respondent, in company with one or more others, entering some form of business premises, at night, and demanding money from the attendant; in four cases the attendant was assaulted, even in the absence of resistance. With that preface, it is possible to state the specifics of each offence briefly. 
     
      
       
      Count 1: 14 November 2005 
       
      
    9 At about 9.20 pm the respondent and a co-offender named Thomas Duffy entered a convenience store at Kingswood. They had their faces concealed. The respondent was carrying a 30 centimetre knife. He demanded money from the store manager, who secured his young brother and returned wielding a milk crate. This caused the two offenders to run from the store and dispose of the knife and the disguises. 
     
      
    10 The respondent was arrested shortly afterwards, charged, and released on bail. 
     
      
       
      Count 2: 28 November 2005 
       
      
    11 Shortly before 3.00 a.m. the respondent knocked on the locked entry door to a service station at Kingswood. The store attendant opened the door and allowed the respondent in. The respondent punched the attendant and threatened him, ordering him not to call the police, and telling him that there were three offenders present. Two co-offenders, with their faces concealed, entered the store and demanded that the attendant open the cash register. This he did. The offenders removed about $500 from the till and cigarettes worth about $500. They then left. The attendant suffered cuts and abrasions to his face. 
     
      
       
      Count 3: 29 November 2005 
       
      
    12 At about 2.30 am the respondent entered a service station at Berkshire Park, selected a drink, and approached the counter. He jumped over the counter, looked behind it, jumped the counter again and then motioned to three other men who were outside to enter. 
     
      
    13 A second staff member approached. One of the offenders approached this person and threatened him with violence, while the respondent and two other offenders again went behind the counter. They punched the first staff member twice, causing a small cut to his lip. They took money from the till and cigarettes; they then forced the second staff member to open a second cash register from which they removed more money. The total amount of money stolen was about $1,500. All offenders then ran from the scene. 
     
      
       
      Count 4: 3 December 2005 
       
      
    14 A group of offenders met at the home of one and agreed to rob the same Berkshire Park service station that was the subject of the previous count. They drove there at about 11.45 pm. Two of the men entered, selected a drink, and approached the counter. As the attendant took the item to scan it one of the men jumped the counter and grabbed hold of him. The other ran to the entry door and motioned to the two outside. The respondent approached the door, which was locked. He collected a trolley and rammed it against the glass entry doors. Shortly after, another of the offenders managed to open the doors. 
     
      
    15 All four took up a position around the attendant in an effort to intimidate him. They demanded that he open the cash register but he refused. The attendant was wearing a headdress of religious significance. One of the men removed it. The respondent punched the attendant, and pulled at his hair until the attendant opened the till. Two of the men removed approximately $300 from the till. They also took approximately $500 worth of cigarettes. All ran from the scene and were driven away. 
     
      
    16 Two of the co-offenders were Rhys McDicken and Christopher Allen. 
     
      
       
      Count 5: 4 December 2005 
       
      
    17 Following the events that gave rise to Count 4, the men agreed to drive to another service station, at Werrington, in order to rob it. They drove to the venue. At about 12.30 am on the following morning the respondent and another of the men knocked on the locked entry doors of the store attached to the service station. The attendant granted entry. The respondent selected a drink, and approached the counter, handing over money. When the attendant tendered change the respondent took hold of his arm and refused to release it. The other man attempted to open a glass door dividing the store from the staff area by kicking it. The two offenders then jumped through the security wiring in front of the attendant and punched him. The attendant was cowering and offering no resistance. The other offender removed a quantity of cigarettes from behind the counter whilst the respondent attempted to gain entry to the till. He was unable to do this. He pulled the attendant back to the register and demanded that he open the till. This he did. The respondent removed the contents of the till. The attendant continued to cower. The respondent punched the attendant on a number of occasions and kneed him to the head. The other offenders entered the store and placed cigarettes and confectionary in a bag. All fled with the proceeds and were driven away. 
     
      
    18 Again, two of the co-offenders were McDicken and Allen. 
     
      
       
      Count 6: 4 December 2005 
       
      
    19 Later on the same day the respondent, together with a number of other men, including some of those who had been present over the evening of 3 and 4 December (and again including McDicken and Allen), agreed to commit another robbery. This time they drove to a Liquorland store at Penrith. The respondent and three other men entered the store. One offender remained outside. The respondent punched the store attendant three times. Another staff member entered the store. The offenders directed him to the rear of the store and threw bottles of alcohol at both attendants. The attendants and the offenders became engaged in a wrestle. One of the offenders stole $370 from the cash register, while others stole an unknown quantity of alcohol. They fled to the car and drove to the home of one of the men. One of the attendants suffered bruising around his left eye. 
     
      
    20 On 8 December 2005 the respondent was arrested. A search was conducted of his home which yielded, inter alia, a number of unopened packets of cigarettes. The respondent claimed that he had bought these cigarettes but could not remember when. When interviewed, he declined to provide any information. Later, however, he submitted to the taking of a buccal swab for the purpose of DNA testing, and to having himself and his clothing photographed. On 7 April 2006 in the Local Court he entered pleas of guilty to all charges. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    21 Evidence of the respondent’s subjective circumstances was put before his Honour in the form of a pre-sentence report, a psychiatric and psychological report, and oral evidence of the respondent. 
     
      
    22 He was born on 14 October 1987. He was therefore just 18 years of age at the time of the offences, 19 at sentencing. His only previous encounter with the criminal law was in September 2005, when he was convicted of common assault, in respect of which he was placed on a good behaviour bond for a period of nine months.  
     
      
    23 To the Probation and Parole officer who prepared the pre-sentence report he and his mother gave different accounts of his early life. He said that he had had a happy childhood, with no significant issues. His mother described his childhood as “quite turbulent”. His parents separated when he was two years of age as a result of physical abuse on the part of the respondent’s father. 
     
      
    24 The respondent contracted meningitis at three years of age and spent some time in hospital on a life support system. At the age of four he began to display violent tendencies and was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at the age of seven. Medication has been prescribed but he has not adhered to it. 
     
      
    25 He left school at the age of 16, in year 10, having been suspended on a number of occasions for fighting. He has had two short-term jobs but has principally remained unemployed. 
     
      
    26 He became dependent on alcohol at about 16 years of age. He now drinks Bourbon. He began smoking cannabis at the age of 14 and crystal-methamphetamine at 16, and, at the time of his arrest, was a daily user. He had not sought help for any of his drug or alcohol issues. 
     
      
    27 This history was given to the Probation and Parole officer by the respondent’s mother. The respondent gave to the psychologist a substantially different account. He said that his parents separated when he was around seven after his father had an extramarital relationship with his wife’s sister; it seems that his father and aunt cohabited and two more children were born of the relationship. 
     
      
    28 Ms Katie Seidler, the psychologist, recorded that the respondent expressed no regret or remorse for his behaviour but described feeling “nothing at all” in relation to his offending. She hypothesised that this may be a function of a developing schizo-type or personality disorder. She described the respondent as “psychologically quite a disturbed young man”. She recorded a history of thought disorder and experiences of quasi-psychotic symptomatology. She said that he appears to have “high levels of ruminative anxiety, probably associated with paranoid thinking”. She also considered it possible that he has a congenital learning disorder affecting his ability to learn, understand and express himself in language. She said that his long-term memory functioning was poor. 
     
      
    29 Dr Allnutt, the psychiatrist who examined the respondent, agreed with Ms Seidler that the respondent was probably manifesting a pre-psychotic phase of illness, or mild symptoms of a developing psychotic disorder. He thought he could also be diagnosed with Derealization or Depersonalisation Disorder. 
     
      
    30 In his oral evidence the respondent confirmed his history of drug use, and some of the background circumstances given in a more detailed way in the two reports. He had had something of a change of heart in relation to his attitude to the offences. When asked how he felt about the victims he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well pretty sad because they would have been frightened you know, so I feel pretty remorse about that and yeah I wish I didn’t do it and that.” 
        
       
      
    He said he understood how they would have felt because he himself, and his parents, had been the victims of break and enters. 
     
      
      The sentencing proceedings 
       
      
    31 The respondent and four co-offenders came before Hughes DCJ for sentencing. (Not all four were involved in all of the six offences to which the respondent pleaded guilty.) His Honour heard evidence and submissions on 6 December 2006 and sentenced all four on 7 December. He recounted the facts of the offences, and turned to the subjective material. He rejected a submission that he should find that the respondent was suffering from a mental illness. Presumably the submission was put with the intention of bringing the respondent within the principles stated in cases such as R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. 
     
      
    32 Having regard to the fact that five of the offences were committed whilst the respondent was on bail, the sentencing judge was not optimistic about the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation. He (correctly) determined that, because of the seriousness of the offences, it was necessary that the respondent spend some time in full-time custody. He found, pursuant to s44 of Sentencing Procedure Act, that special circumstances existed justifying departure from the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period there specified. He identified the special circumstances as the respondent’s youth, the fact that he had never previously been convicted of any offence, and that he had shown some remorse (although he gave little weight to this last circumstance). 
     
      
    33 He then stated that he proposed to adopt the guideline promulgated in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346. In Henry, in relation to offences of armed robbery falling into a particular pattern, this Court promulgated a guideline (head) sentence of between four and five years. The pattern identified included a plea of guilty, although a late plea. His Honour found that the second offence “goes to the highest end of the Henry range” (apparently by reason of its having been committed while the respondent was on bail, and because of the violence involved) and began with a sentence of five years, which he then discounted by 25% in purported reliance on R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. He made a similar finding (either expressly or by implication) in respect of each of the fourth, fifth and sixth offences, and took a similar approach, beginning with a sentence of five years and discounting it by 25%. Actual violence again appears to be the basis of the characterisation of the offences at the upper end of the Henry range. He made a specific finding that the third offence: 
     
      
       
        
        “… should attract the lowest of the  
        Henry 
         suggestions …” 
        
       
      
    and began with a four year head sentence, then discounted. He made no express corresponding finding in relation to the first offence, but, as he began with the head sentence of four years, it may be inferred that he regarded it as less serious than others. Having regard to the circumstance that the offence was not completed in the sense that the offenders left when confronted by the victim with a milk crate, and that the respondent was not then on bail, this may have been open to his Honour. It does, however, overlook the further important circumstance that the respondent was armed with a knife.34 In purporting to apply his finding of special circumstances, his Honour varied what he called the “usual ratio” between the head sentence and the non-parole period; on the first offence, he sentenced the respondent to a non-parole period of 12 months with a balance of term of 24 months. (It is apparent that his Honour was under a misapprehension as to what is the “usual ratio”: see paragraph 38 below.) He proceeded then to impose the sentences set out above, in each case varying the statutory ratio, but in different degrees. 
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal 
       
      
    35 The Crown sought to identify four discrete errors in the sentencing process. These were formulated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that he was sentencing the respondent for a multiplicity of offences. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the aggravating feature that five of the offences were committed whilst the respondent was on bail. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the aggravating feature that the second, fourth, fifth and sixth offences involved gratuitous actual violence. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) His Honour partially double counted the discount for the pleas of guilty.” 
        
       
      
    36 Counsel for the respondent conceded error as contended in the first and last of these. The error disclosed in the first was failure to accumulate, or at least partially accumulate, some or all of the sentences. 
     
      
    37 The error in relation to the last involved a misunderstanding of the guidelines in Henry. This is because the features of the pattern of offences to which Henry applies include a plea of guilty, although (in contrast to the present case in which his Honour expressly found that the pleas of guilty were early pleas) a late plea of guilty. Accordingly, while the respondent may have been entitled to some additional discount by reason of the timing of his pleas of guilty, he could not have been entitled to 25% which is at the top of the range specified in Thomson and Houlton, and is partly already built into the Henry guideline. 
     
      
    38 His Honour was under a further misapprehension, that the statutory proportions called for by s44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act is “two thirds to one third” (ROS p 32). This is a misconstruction of s44; what s44 prescribes is, absent special circumstances, that the balance of term – i.e. the period during which the offender will be eligible for release on parole – does not exceed one third of the non-parole period. The statutory proportions therefore are 75%: 25%. 
     
      
    39 Counsel did not concede the errors contended in (b) and (c) above; she argued that, two errors having been demonstrated, it will be necessary for this Court to proceed to re-sentence, and that it is therefore unnecessary to take time determining whether the first instance sentences were infected by additional error. 
     
      
    40 This is, in my opinion, essentially incorrect. The concessions made on behalf of the respondent were properly made. The errors for which the Crown contends in (a) and (d) were indeed demonstrated. But that does not, of itself, oblige or even entitle this Court to re-sentence. That obligation or entitlement arises only if this Court is also of the view that the individual sentences (or the combination of sentences in their totality) are shown to be manifestly inadequate to meet the totality of the respondent’s criminal behaviour. Patent error of the kind conceded may be relevant to explain how a manifestly inadequate sentence came to be imposed. It does not, of itself, trigger the jurisdiction of this Court to set aside a sentence and to sentence afresh. Nor does it establish manifest inadequacy. 
     
      
    41 To trigger the jurisdiction of this Court it is necessary that the Crown establish that the sentence imposed is outside the range of sentences legitimately available in the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    42 In Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295, the majority (Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ) quoted from Griffith v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 (Barwick CJ) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “…an appeal by the Attorney-General should be a rarity, brought only to establish some matter of principle and to afford an opportunity for the Court of Criminal Appeal to perform its proper function in this respect, namely, to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.” 
        
       
      
    43 Their Honours went on to identify the “matter of principle” in that passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “… as encompassing what is necessary to avoid the kind of manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards which Barwick CJ saw as constituting ‘error in point of principle’.” (p 300) 
        
       
       
      McHugh J said, in a passage which has been extensively quoted: 
       
       
        
        “It is only when the Court of Criminal Appeal is convinced that the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range that it is ever justified in granting leave to the Crown to appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence. Disagreement about the adequacy of a sentence is not enough to warrant the grant of leave. Sentencing is too inexact a science to make mere disagreement the criterion for the grant of leave to appeal against inadequacy of a sentence. The requirement of leave gives rise to the inference that Parliament intended that something more than mere error was to be the criterion of the grant of leave.” 
        
       
      
    44 As will be apparent from the extracted passages, Everett was an appeal from a jurisdiction in which, unlike this jurisdiction, the Crown required the leave of the court in order to appeal against a sentence asserted to be manifestly inadequate. However, the observations are easily and equally applicable to this jurisdiction; Crown appeals against sentence should only succeed in the same circumstances as are required, in jurisdictions where leave is necessary, for the grant of leave. 
     
      
    45 Counsel also referred to the extensively quoted passage in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 repeating the principles that apply to the determination of appeal by the Crown. The passage is so well known it is unnecessary yet again to reproduce it. 
     
      
    46 Counsel for the respondent relied heavily upon the decision of this Court in R v Adam Drollett [2002] NSWCCA 13, seeking to establish something of a benchmark that can be applied to the present case. Drollett was a case that had significant parallels with the present, but also some departures. Drollett also was a Crown appeal. Drollett was eighteen years and nine months at the time of the commission of the offences the subject of the judgment. He not only had a criminal record, and that for offences of the same kind; he was unlawfully at large at the time of the subject offences, having failed to return to custody following day release. He faced ten counts on an indictment, of offences against s97(1) or (2) – robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, or robbery in company. The maximum penalty of imprisonment applicable to the offence against s97(2) was imprisonment for 25 years; the other offences attract a maximum penalty of 20 years, as is here the case. 
     
      
    47 In addition, Drollett asked that a further 14 offences, predominantly of the same kind, listed on a Form 1 be taken into account. Accordingly, Drollett’s criminality involved 24 separate offences. 
     
      
    48 At first instance Drollett was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment for five years and six months with an effective non-parole period of four years, one month and fifteen days. All sentences were specified to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    49 This Court held that the overall term of the sentence was manifestly inadequate, and that the circumstances called for some measure of accumulation in the structure of the sentences imposed in respect of the ten offences to which Drollett pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    50 That that applies to the present case is, as I have set out above, conceded. This Court re-sentenced Drollett in such a way as to impose an effective head sentence of seven years, with a non-parole period of five years. 
     
      
    51 Counsel for the present respondent, however, pointed out (correctly) that Drollett’s criminality was greater than that of the respondent in at least three respects – the number of offences for which he was being sentenced; the circumstances of his being at liberty; and that this was not the first time he had faced the court in relation to offences of the kind. 
     
      
    52 I accept that these are significant matters of variation, all in the respondent’s favour. 
     
      
    53 Counsel for the respondent, in effect, sought to use this decision as a yardstick for the present case, urging that the differences, in the respondent’s favour, should result in the reimposition of the sentences substantially as imposed by Hughes DCJ. 
     
      
    54 I am unable to accept that this is a correct approach. The decision in Drollett is no more than one instance of how this Court has dealt with a case that has significant parallels. It by no means prescribes the appropriate sentence and does not even amount to a yardstick. In any event, even after sentencing, the penalties imposed upon Drollett appear to be extraordinarily lenient. 
     
      
    55 Another decision, relied upon by the Crown, also demonstrating significant parallels, is to be found in R v Speeding [2001] NSWCCA 105; 121 A Crim R 426. Speeding was 19 years of age at the time of his offences. Over a five month period he committed six offences of robbery when armed with an offensive weapon (although one was charged, inexplicably, as robbery simpliciter). He was arrested and charged after the fourth offence, and was released on bail. He was accordingly (like the present respondent after his first offence) subject to conditional liberty when he committed the fifth and sixth offences. He was drug, alcohol, and gambling addicted, but had some prospects of overcoming the drug and alcohol addiction; less of overcoming the gambling addiction. 
     
      
    56 The sentencing judge considered the offences all to be typical Henry offences and that, therefore, the appropriate head sentence in each case was between four and five years. He then imposed a series of sentences escalating in severity. The escalation in severity was significantly ameliorated by an order that all sentences be served concurrently. The overall effect was a sentence of five years and three months with a non-parole period of two years and nine months. 
     
      
    57 A Crown appeal resulted in an adjustment of individual sentences together with an order that the sentences imposed in respect of the fifth and sixth offences (each of five years and three months, with a non-parole period of two years and nine months) be accumulated by two years on the earlier sentences. The net effect was a total sentence of seven years and three months with a non-parole period of four years and nine months. 
     
      
    58 Having regard to the post-appeal sentences imposed on Drollett, counsel for the respondent contended that the sentences imposed on the present respondent could not be seen to be “definitely outside the appropriate range” and ought, therefore, not to be the subject of intervention by this Court. Speeding, in my opinion, firmly establishes to the contrary. It is Drollett that is aberrational. 
     
      
    59 Alternatively, counsel argued, the Crown had not: 
     
      
       
        
        “… displaced the operation of this Court’s residual discretion to dismiss the Crown appeal.” 
        
       
      
    60 This latter submission contains within it a fallacy. It is true that the Court retains a residual discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal which otherwise has merit; however, the onus lies upon the respondent to establish that that discretion ought to be exercised in his or her favour. No discretionary circumstances were identified that would justify the exercise of the discretion in the respondent’s favour, if this Court were otherwise of the view that error that would attract the intervention of this Court had been established. 
     
      
    61 An attempt was made, somewhat faintly, I thought, to rely, as a relevant discretionary consideration, on the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders. This could not succeed. The sentences imposed upon each of the co-offenders were suspended. However, Duffy faced only one count on an indictment, asking that Form 1 offences, made up three offences of break, enter and steal, one of drive a conveyance without consent, and one of driving a vehicle displaying misleading numberplates, be taken into account. The sentence imposed upon him was a total period of two years and three months, with a non-parole period of nine months and a balance of term of eighteen months, which, as I have indicated, was suspended. McDicken faced three counts on an indictment, each committed in company with the respondent. On each he was sentenced to imprisonment for two years, made up of a non-parole period of six months, and a balance of term of eighteen months. Each was also suspended. 
     
      
    62 Allen pleaded guilty to the same three offences as McDicken. He was also sentenced to a head sentence of two years, but with a non-parole period of nine months and balance of term of fifteen months. He was allowed, not only a 25% discount for an early plea, but an additional 25% discount for assistance given, when he promptly acknowledged his guilt and implicated the co-offenders. 
     
      
    63 Of great significance in this respect is the circumstance that, when he committed all but one of the offences, the respondent was on bail in respect of the first. 
     
      
    64 That the attempt to introduce a parity argument into the question of the exercise of this Court’s residual decision must fail is apparent, if for no other reason, by reference to express passage in the remarks on sentence. The judge noted that the respondent had not only participated in six offences, compared with one on the part of Duffy, and three each on the part of McDicken and Allen, but held that he had played “a more leading role than the others”. Somewhat curiously, he also seems to have taken into account that the respondent “is not as well educated as the others”. However, leaving that aside, he held that the use of violence in some of the offences elevated the objective seriousness of his criminality relative to that of the co-offenders. 
     
      
    65 Accordingly, I would reject the submission that the sentences imposed upon the respondent could be saved by reference to the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders. 
     
      
    66 In my opinion the Crown is plainly correct in its contentions. The guideline sentence promulgated in Henry (which is concerned with armed robberies, but is equally applicable to robbery in company) is of four to five years’ head sentence, with an appropriate minimum term (depending, inter alia, upon whether or not special circumstances are found); as I have mentioned above, it incorporates some discount for a plea of guilty, although a late plea. It is also applicable where the offender is charged with a single offence. Multiplicity of offences plainly calls for a total sentence well in excess of the four to five years so promulgated. While it may be correct that each individual sentence could fall appropriately within the four to five year range, it must also be recognised that, as the offending continues, each succeeding offence calls for a greater punishment than the earlier, if only by way of personal deterrence. And to order that all sentences be served concurrently has the effect of neutralising, or at least minimising, the sentences applicable to the later offence. To sentence in that way does nothing to discourage sequential offending; indeed, it gives the appearance that once an offence has been committed, the offender has little or nothing to lose by repetition. 
     
      
    67 For a total of six offences, without even considering the Form 1 offences, the respondent’s conduct required the imposition of a significantly lengthier overall term of imprisonment, by way both of head sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
    68 I propose that this Court allow the appeal, quash the sentences and impose, in substitution, sentences that will produce an overall head sentence of five and a half years. I would not disturb the finding of special circumstances, and would, accordingly, impose an overall non-parole period of three years and nine months. Even this is barely adequate to recognise the criminality involved, or the affront to the victims. I propose it in acknowledgement of the well-known principles applicable to sentencing after a successful Crown appeal. I also have in mind the respondent’s youth, and that the offences were committed over a short space of time. In relation to all counts except the last, I propose fixed terms, because any parole period would be subsumed in the later sentences, and there is no useful purpose to be served by making such an order. 
     
      
    69 I propose that the sentences be structured as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 (taking into account the Form 1 offences): a fixed term of two years and nine months, commencing on 8 December 2005 and expiring on 7 September 2008; 
       
       
      Counts 2 and 3: a fixed term of imprisonment for three years, commencing on 8 March 2006 and expiring on 7 March 2009; 
       
       
      Counts 4 and 5: a fixed term of imprisonment for three years and three months, commencing on 8 June 2006 and expiring on 7 September 2009; 
       
       
      Count 6: imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and three months, commencing on 8 June 2006 and expiring on 7 September 2009, with a balance of term of one year and nine months, expiring on 7 June 2011. 
       
       
      The earliest date on which the respondent would be eligible for release on parole is 7 September 2009.

      2004/2997 REGINA v Alejandro ALMIROL 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT [No 2] - JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On 7 March 2005, Alejandro Almirol was arraigned before Justice James for having murdered Palataveke Tauveli at Regents Park on 15 December 2002. Prehector Trocio (""Hector"" Trocio) was arraigned upon the same charge. Hector Trocio pleaded guilty and was later sentenced for that murder. 
     
      
    2 The trial of Alejandro Almirol was then adjourned. He ultimately was arraigned before me and a jury on 5 February 2007 on the charge of having murdered Palataveke Tauveli, On 15 March 2007, after a trial lasting six weeks, Mr Almirol was, by majority (11:1), found not guilty.  
     
      
    3 Mr Almirol was then arraigned on a subsidiary charge of having been an accessory after the fact to murder (s349 Crimes Act 1900). Mr Almirol pleaded guilty to that charge. It now remains for me to pass sentence upon that charge. Before doing so, I should determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion. Where the facts are adverse, they must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Almirol, it is enough that they should be established on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
       
      The murder. 
       
      
    4 Alejandro Almirol was born in the Philippines in 1964. He came from a village in an area known as Cab City. He had limited education. He arrived in Australia on a tourist visa on 5 December 1998. The visa was valid for one year. He hoped, however, to remain in Australia for a decade earning income which could be sent home to assist in the education of his daughters. 
     
      
    5 Whilst in Australia, Mr Almirol worked as a car detailer. When doing so he met Hector Trocio. Mr Trocio was a younger man, also born in the Philippines. They became friends. Indeed, Mr Almirol said that he regarded Hector as ""like my younger brother"". 
     
      
    6 Hector Trocio left car detailing to work in a cheese factory in Yagoona. Later he was able to secure a job for Mr Almirol at the same factory. Palatavake Tauveli (""the deceased"") also worked at the factory. The deceased originally came from a Pacific Island. When working at the factory, Mr Almirol lived at 1 Maunder Street, Regents Park, in a house occupied by Mr Rodney Davis and his wife, Cora. Mrs Cora Davis came from the same area in the Philippines as Mr Almirol and knew his wife. 
     
      
    7 On Sunday 15 December 1992, Mr and Mrs Davis left Australia for the Philippines on a holiday. Mr Almirol was permitted to remain in the house during their absence. That day he went to work soon after 5.00 am, finishing at about midday. He arranged for the deceased and Hector to come to Maunder Street that afternoon for a drink. Indeed, he met the deceased on his way home soon after he finished work. They purchased a bottle of Jim Beam whisky and then went to Maunder Street. 
     
      
    8 Mr Almirol did not usually drink whisky, although he had drunk it before. He was described as a moderate drinker who mainly drank beer. He was physically a small man, 5 feet 2 inches in height, and a little more than 50 kilograms in weight. The deceased, in contrast, was an enormous man, said to be 6 feet 5 inches in height and weighing approximately 135 kilograms. 
     
      
    9 During the course of the afternoon, friends came to Maunder Street and noticed that Mr Almirol and the deceased were both drunk. Hector Trocio arrived at about 3.30 pm. He was not drunk, although he did drink one or two beers during the afternoon. 
     
      
    10 I need not recount in detail the circumstances in which the deceased met his death. It is enough to say that, at some time after 4.30 pm, the deceased was repeatedly struck with a metal chair, such that he became disabled and lay on the kitchen floor. Whilst on the floor his throat was cut. The issue in the murder trial concerning Mr Almirol was whether he or Hector Trocio, or both, had cut the deceased's throat. The Crown submitted that the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to one or other of these alternatives. It argued that, were the jury to take the view that Hector Trocio had cut the deceased's throat, they could nonetheless be satisfied that he was acting in concert with Mr Almirol or, alternatively, that Mr Almirol had been present and encouraging or aiding Hector Trocio in what he did. By its verdict, the jury (by majority) must be taken to have rejected these submissions. Mr Almirol had no role in the murder. 
     
      
       
      Assistance after death. 
       
      
    11 Nonetheless, Mr Almirol was present when the deceased's throat was cut. He therefore knew that the deceased had been murdered by Hector Trocio. And, knowing that, he gave assistance. Hector Trocio directed him shortly after the murder to find something in which to wrap the body. Mr Almirol then provided a bed sheet. Together they moved the body to a bedroom at the front of the house. The plan was to transfer the body to a car and dispose of it. The deceased, however, was simply too heavy. It was determined, in these circumstances, that further help was needed. Late on the evening of Sunday 15 December, Mr Almirol and Hector Trocio telephoned a friend seeking that help, although without success. 
     
      
    12 The next day the decision was taken to cut the body up, so that it could then be removed. There were differing accounts as to the role performed by Hector Trocio on the one hand, and Mr Almirol on the other, in cutting up the deceased. Hector Trocio gave evidence that the body was cut up by Mr Almirol, although he acknowledged that at one point he assisted by holding the deceased's legs. Mr Almirol, on the other hand, asserted that most of the work was undertaken by Hector Trocio, with him assisting. I prefer the evidence of Mr Almirol. Mr Trocio was a most unimpressive witness. I think it probable that Mr Almirol performed a subsidiary, although important, role. Plastic bags were used for the body parts, for the blood stained sheet and other incriminating items. 
     
      
    13 Hector Trocio and Mr Almirol then loaded the plastic bags into a car belonging to Mr Rodney Davis. Hector Trocio, with Mr Almirol as his passenger, drove to the Blue Mountains where the plastic bags were dumped in remote bushland in three scattered locations. Again, the accounts of Hector Trocio and Mr Almirol differed as to who selected the Blue Mountains and the method of disposal. Again, I prefer the account of Mr Almirol. I think it far more likely that Hector Trocio selected the Blue Mountains and the method of disposal. Mr Almirol had very little knowledge of Australia at the time of these events. 
     
      
    14 The following day, Tuesday 17 December 2002, the house at 1 Maunder Street was cleaned. Mr Almirol was present and gave assistance to Hector Trocio and his wife. 
     
      
    15 The objective seriousness of a person assisting another to dispose of a body, and thereafter cleaning up, cannot be doubted. Thomas J in Hawken ((1986) 27 A Crim R 32), said this: (at 38) 
     
      
       
        
        ""… It is in the interests of the community that murderers should be completely isolated from support and deprived of assistance and that such crimes be not covered up. The severe penalty available against accessories after the fact is a way in which the community protects itself and it is an aspect of the law's general deterrence against homicide."" 
        
       
      
    16 The crime is the more serious where, as in this case (and unlike R v Quach [2002] NSWSC 1205), the accessory is present when the murder is committed and is therefore apprised of the enormity of what has occurred, which he then helps to conceal.  
     
      
    17 However, a number of matters ameliorate the moral culpability of Mr Almirol. The first concerns his state of mind at the moment when Hector Trocio called upon him to give assistance. When ordered to ""find something to wrap the body in"", Mr Almirol was, by reason of the alcohol consumed, in something of a stupor. Professor Starmer, the Associate Profession of Pharmacology at the University of Sydney, gave evidence before the jury concerning his likely degree of intoxication. Professor Starmer's evidence was based upon certain assumptions. Making those assumptions, he said that at 6.35 pm (when Hector Trocio's wife came to 1 Maunder Street to collect her husband), the most likely blood alcohol concentration of Mr Almirol was approximately 0.288 grams per 100 millilitres of blood. Whilst there may be argument about some of the assumptions, it cannot be doubted that at the time of the murder, and later that evening, Mr Almirol was and remained, significantly affected by alcohol. Therefore, his ability to think rationally about his situation and the way in which he should respond to the demands of Hector Trocio, had been significantly impaired. 
     
      
    18 Secondly, I do not doubt that Mr Almirol was also shocked by what had occurred. More than that, I accept that he felt a degree of apprehension for his own safety. He had known Hector Trocio well for a period of four years. He regarded him as a good friend. However, Hector Trocio had behaved that afternoon in a paranoid way which Mr Almirol had not previously experienced. Indeed, Hector Trocio accused Mr Almirol of complicity in the plan he suggested the deceased had to kill him. Within a short time of that accusation, Mr Almirol had witnessed the murder. To adopt the words of Wood CJ at CL in R v Faulkner [2000] NSWSC 944 (at para [46]), Mr Almirol, when asked for assistance was ""on the spot, and in a potentially difficult and unexpected position, if he refused to go along with at least the initial request for help"". 
     
      
    19 Thirdly, by providing assistance that night, whilst significantly impaired by alcohol, and in some fear of Hector Trocio, Mr Almirol had been drawn into Hector Trocio's crime. Indeed, he was repeated told by Hector Trocio that he was part of it. There was no backing out. It was then but a short step to the provision of further assistance which he gave in the days that followed. 
     
      
    20 Fourthly, in making these statements I do not doubt the importance of the pre-existing friendship between Hector Trocio and Mr Almirol. It was said, and I accept, that culturally and by that friendship, Mr Almirol felt bound to Hector Trocio, notwithstanding his horror at what had occurred. Mr Almirol's status as an illegal immigrant was, no doubt, also a factor. It may be inferred that he did not regard himself as having the option of simply reporting the matter to the police. That said, it must be acknowledged he may also have regarded concealment as in his interests lest the matter come to the attention of the immigration authorities, thereby jeopardising his continued presence in Australia.  
     
      
    21 Giving full weight to these circumstances, the crime committed by Mr Almirol is nonetheless obviously a most serious offence. The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment. Counsel have helpfully referred me to a number of cases involving somewhat similar offences. They include R v Hawken (supra); R v Winston (1994) 74 A Crim R 312; R v Faulkner (supra); R v Quach (supra); R v Galea [2003] NSWSC 465; R v Gersteling [2004] NSWSC 502; R v Mirad [2004] NSWSC 701. In terms of objective seriousness, I regard this case as falling somewhere between R v Quach and R v Faulkner, that is, more serious than Quach, but less serious than Faulkner. 
     
      
    22 The Crown submitted that there were two aggravating circumstances, referring to paragraphs in s21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Act""). It was said that the offence was ""committed in company"" (s21A(2)(e)) and that it was an offence which was ""part of a planned or organised criminal activity"" (s21A(2)(n)). An accessory after the fact is, by definition, a person who provides assistance to an offender, although that offender need not be present when the assistance is given. Nonetheless, in the usual case, the assistance will involve the two being together. However, the section was not intended to alter the Common Law. In my view, the fact that Mr Almirol was with Hector Trocio does not amount to being ""in company"" (cf R v Button & Griffen (2002) 129 A Crim R 242). Nor do I regard the offence as a ""planned or organised criminal activity"". Unquestionably, execution of the offence involved a number of steps to be carried out in sequence. However, such planning as there was, was undertaken, I believe, by the principal offender, Hector Trocio, rather than Mr Almirol. 
     
      
    23 Let me turn from the offence to the offender, Mr Almirol. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case. 
       
      
    24 As mentioned, Mr Almirol was born in the Philippines on 18 November 1964. He is now aged 42 years. He is a person of previous good character (s21A(3)(f) of the Act). He has no criminal conviction, whether in the Philippines or in Australia (s21A(3)(e)). He is a married man with two grown up daughters. His purpose in coming to Australia was to earn money to further their education. Whilst in Australia, he apparently lived an inconspicuous life which he described as ""home, work, home, work"". I accept that he is a person unlikely to re-offend (s21A(3)(g)). I believe that he has excellent prospects of rehabilitation (s21A(3)(h)). 
     
      
    25 I also accept that Mr Almirol has shown remorse. He regarded the deceased as ""a good man"". He got on well with him, including on the afternoon of the 15 December 2002. The afternoon was described as ""jovial"" before the arrival of Hector. He was shocked by what had occurred. As disclosed by the intercepted telephone calls, he is a religious man, who was plainly troubled by what had occurred. 
     
      
    26 As stated, Mr Almirol pleaded guilty to the offence for which he is now being sentenced. That plea was formally entered on 15 March 2007 after the jury had returned its verdict in respect of the charge of murder. The Crown, nonetheless, accepted that his legal representatives gave an earlier indication that their client would acknowledge his guilt as an accessory after the fact. That indication was given, according to the Crown, after Justice James gave permission on 6 September 2006 for Mr Almirol to withdraw his plea of guilty to murder.  
     
      
    27 Counsel for Mr Almirol, however, suggested that indications had been given of such a plea somewhat earlier and then repeated in September 2006. There had been discussions about a plea of guilty to the present charge as early as 2004, at the time of the committal. I believe, in the circumstances, the appropriate discount for the plea of guilty is 15%. 
     
      
    28 The sentence should date from the time Mr Almirol was first taken into custody in the Philippines. The precise date was uncertain, although it was known to be May 2004. With the consent of the parties, I will take the commencement date of incarceration as 1 May 2004. 
     
      
    29 Counsel for Mr Almirol suggested that I should make a finding of special circumstances and vary the ratio between the term of imprisonment imposed and the non parole period. It is Mr Almirol's first time in custody. His English is imperfect. It was suggested he has experienced, and will experience, a degree of isolation which will make his incarceration the more difficult. On the other hand, as the Crown pointed out, Mr Almirol chose to isolate himself from his family when he decided to remain in this country beyond the expiry date of his visa. In all the circumstances, I do not believe it is appropriate to make a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    30 It is perhaps likely that Mr Almirol will be deported at the end of the non parole period. However that is not a matter relevant to the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    31 I am confronted with a serious offence by an offender with a strong subjective case. I believe, in these circumstances, that but for the plea of guilty, a term of five years imprisonment (with a corresponding non parole period) would be appropriate. I will therefore discount that term by 15%, with a small adjustment to round the figures. 
     
      
    32 ALEJANDRO ALMIROL, I hereby sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 3 months dating from 1 May 2004 and expiring on 31 July 2008; with a non parole period of 3 years and 2 months dating from 1 May 2004 and expiring on 30 June 2007. The first day upon which you will be eligible for parole will be 1 July 2007.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: For some years now Stanley John Sebbens has lived as a single male at the Camp Obadier Christian Community. He suffers from schizophrenia and in the normal course of events is usually good about taking his medication. 2 On 1 November, ironically All Saints Day, 2005 Dr David Allen, who also resides at a house within Camp Obadier, had placed a cash box containing something of the order of six to seven thousand dollars in a wardrobe upstairs above his surgery. He had not done banking for a couple of weeks and there were cheques and cash there. 3 He woke up at seven the next morning to find that the cash box had been taken from the wardrobe. The cash box and the cheques were located in the Camp Obadier region. A couple of days later on 4 November Dr Allen attended the Taree Police Station with Stanley Sebbens. Doctor Allen had spoken to the offender and the offender admitted to him stealing the cash box. He, that is Stanley Sebbens, was spoken to by police who were of a view that he was displaying symptoms consistent with a mental illness. He was interviewed.4 In the course of the interview he indicated that he had entered the premises through a closed but unlocked front door - I image most of the doors around Camp Obadier are probably unlocked - that he knew Dr Allen was at home and had presumed he had gone to sleep. He had searched the upstairs room, located the cash box and taken it. He had taken it to his own room. He had used a screwdriver to open the box and he took approximately two thousand three hundred and twenty five dollars. The rest of the material was there left. 5 He had made his way to Maitland where he drank five middies, he said, of VB beer - which is possibly an understatement - and played the poker machines. He put a thousand dollars and such winnings as he had made through the machines. He then caught a train to Muswellbrook, went to another hotel and repeated the exercise drinking beer and playing the poker machines. He there lost four hundred dollars. He then went to Singleton and did the same thing yet again put six hundred dollars through. All up he thought he had about eight hundred dollars left. He woke up in Singleton Hospital and was being treated for head injuries. He is unable to account for how he had received the injuries. Ultimately discharged from hospital, returned to Maitland, again consumed alcohol and put three hundred dollars through the poker machines. Finally he returned to the Forster/Tuncurry area where he was spotted by Dr Allen. It was at that point that he confessed to Dr Allen that he had taken the cash box.6 The offence is a serious one. I am satisfied it was motivated by a desire to consume alcohol and to gamble. There maybe some perception that the offender has, that gambling is a macho/adult type way to behave. It may also be that he has a gambling addiction problem as well. 7 Of significance when this matter came before me in April last year at Taree was a letter from the doctor whose premises had been burgled. The doctor wrote in these terms, 
     
      
      “Although I acknowledge that I have little understanding of your task of sentencing I do however believe in the principle of mercy. As such and as the victim of Stanley’s crime I would like to express the fact that I would be satisfied if Stanley received a sentence in line with the principle expressed in Jewdish law that he should repay the amount not reclaimed, twenty six hundred dollars plus twenty percent.” 
      
    The doctor continued, 
     
      
      “He could repay this to myself by performing supervised work in my garden at a rate of fifteen dollars per hour with $3,350 to be repaid. This would be four hours per week for fifty-two weeks.” 
      
    8 There was also on that occasion a presentence report before me which indicated that the offender had been before courts at least since 1980 and had been supervised by Probation and Parole. A case management of him in the past had focused upon his mental health issues, gambling and alcohol problems, adherence to medication, financial management and compliance with his responsibilities as a member of the Obadier Christian Community. These are all worthwhile focuses for him.9 When discussing his attitude to the offence, the presentence report author noted that he was highly emotional when discussing his offence and made this observation, 
     
      
      “Whilst acknowledging the impact on his victim it was the potential risk of losing the support of Obadier residents and in particular Mr and Mrs Stafford, the administrators, which he found distressing.” 
      
    10 I am satisfied that the relationship between the offender on the one hand and Pastor and Mrs Stafford on the other is a very close and supportive relationship and one of great value to Stanley Sebbens.11 Pastor Daryl Stafford gave evidence before me on the first occasion and indeed on two subsequent occasions indicating generally what is contained in a report that was tendered this morning that the offender had carried out his obligations to Dr Dave Allen successfully and without complications. 12 There were in fact complications because Dr Allen was not always there and a sort of quid pro quo arrangement was instituted whereby work being done for the community was recognised as equating in part or in whole - I am not entirely sure - to the obligation undertaken to Dave Allen. 13 Pastor Stafford also noted that he had attended to continue Probation and Parole appointments as required. That was elaborated on in evidence this morning. The pastor said that frequently arrangements were made with others in the community to attend Port Macquarie or where ever it was that the offender had to attend to report to Probation and Parole, or other appointments. They would go as a group to that place. But on occasions the offender himself was required to make his own way there and back.14 I was impressed with that evidence because it shows that Sebbens is prepared to accept, and can be trusted to accept on occasions, responsibility for his actions providing the tasks are clearly defined and have, as it were, a beginning period and an end period.15 He has attended appointments with Dr Ted Campbell, a clinical psychologist - and I will come to that shortly. He has continued to take prescribed medication. Pastor Stafford notes that Stanley Sebbens has become somewhat anxious as sentencing day approaches and I am sure that that would be a normal reaction for anybody. 16 In the course of evidence today Pastor Stafford spoke about an ultimatum that had been given to the offender that he could no longer come back if there was another offence. Frankly my focus is perhaps a more narrow focus than that of the pastor, who has a larger community to look after than the person with whom I am involved. But one of the very crucial ingredients of rehabilitation is support and support that an offender knows can be ongoing even in difficult times. His own self image will be locked into a view that others take of him. Were he fearful of being excommunicated, as it were, from those he loves and from those who have been supportive of him, it may in fact be counterproductive. That is not to say that it may ultimately be the appropriate course, if his behaviour interferes with the lives of others in that community. 17 The outcome that I am giving is predicated upon, and I am not seeking to obligate anybody here, but is predicated upon ongoing support from his community. If I were not confident of that some other outcome may well have to be investigated. There are plenty of instances in the Christian culture of forgiveness and of acceptance, continual acceptance of the “prodigal son” and that from our point of view plays an important aspect in our assessment of rehabilitation. 18 I come to the report of Ted Campbell who in July of last year was saying this, and it seems to me it is as true then as it is now or true now as it was then, that his treatment has consisted of sessions aimed as combating the poor self concept Mr Sebbens holds of himself. 19 Let me pause here and at least say this for his consideration:- my experience is that people dealing with addictions, whether addictions to alcohol, drugs or gambling, who are able to combat those addictions with a modicum of success, (in my view you have done better than that) ought to be able to hold their heads up high. Because to overcome or contain an addiction which continually niggles at you is a sign of great courage and significant determination. But it is not something that you can ever let go of, you must continually fight it until it gets further and further away from the centre of your being. 20 Dr Campbell speaks of issues centring on the offender’s sense of his unworthiness, his weakness at combating drinking and gambling tendencies and a general feeling of isolation. These, he said, all contribute to his abuse of others when he becomes a bit depressed. The rationale is that if Mr Sebbens can appreciate his strength and his abilities more, he will be less likely to feel badly when things go wrong for him. 21 In treatment they have also examined the importance of the people at Camp Obadier in his life and their importance to him. He commenced to examine how the offender can better deal with daily life frustrations that impact upon him with a view to developing new coping strategies.22 It seems to me that a continuation of that treatment is the better way to secure community safety than placing this offender into full time prison, where sixty something percent of people leaving re-offend within two years. In terms of the offender’s attitude Dr Campbell says, 
     
      
      “Mr Sebbens has been punctual and reliable in attending all appointments made for him. He has worked hard and I feel has begun to benefit from the sessions.” 
      
    That for me is significant. 23 Continuing on with Dr Campbell’s comments, he tells me that the offender has enjoyed the sessions and learned a lot about himself. There was a recommendation for another six sessions. 24 I would urge those who will oversight of the offender to continue that treatment. 25 The report in December of last year made this observation, 
     
      
       
      “Recently the offender left Obadier Community having sought permission from fellow residents in the absence of camp administrators to be absent two days. However he extended his absence to five days during which time he gambled and consumed alcohol having obtained his Centrelink payment. During this absence he missed an appointment with his psychologist as well as his anti-psychotic and anti-depression medication.” 
      
    26 To his credit he returned to Obadier and resumed his medication. 27 He will have to learn that there will be times when Pastor Stafford and his wife are absent from the community. He will have to take responsibility for his actions during their absence. That conduct, strictly speaking, represented a breach of the bail that I had given and could have resulted in him being incarcerated. 28 The offence that was committed is a serious one. That is made plain to me by the law; the law says that the maximum penalty for this offence is twenty years imprisonment. If this offence falls within what is called a mid range of seriousness, I am obliged to consider why I should not impose what is called the standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment. So this offence you are talking big time criminality. 29 The criminality is related to these propositions, firstly it is an offence against the person to invade his private space and his privacy and to take property from him, and secondly it is an offence against the property that is taken. It is a trespass against the property that is taken. 30 It has been submitted and I think correctly so, that this is not an offence that would have fallen within a mid range of seriousness. There are a number of reasons that convince me of this on its objective criminality. There was no damage to any property in order to secure the entry. That is to say there was no lock damage, the offender simply opened the door and walked in. He was known to his victim. So it is not as though a total stranger had intruded into the victim’s personal space. There was only one room that was visited, although I imagine that that room was disturbed. The disturbance of the room was limited to one locale only.31 In any event he has pleaded guilty. That plea is a demonstration of remorse and was entered at the first available opportunity. He would have been entitled to a full discount in any event. It is said that the standard non-parole period only applies to accused persons after trial. 32 His subjective factors and particularly his schizophrenic condition and his absence of medication, and I read somewhere where he was actually hearing voices at the time of this offence are all matters that would tend to militate against a finding that the offence fell within the mid range of seriousness. 33 Both parties have submitted that a sentence of full time incarceration is not required. The crown has submitted, and again I think correctly so, that a term of imprisonment none the less is called for. I intend to impose a term of imprisonment. But as the crown submitted, and I think the defence would not be seen to disagree with the proposition, that sentence will be suspended. 34 The significance of the suspended sentence should be explained to the offender so that he understands if there is any other offence which breaches the good behaviour bond that I am about to give him I must consider whether the law permits me to do other than incarcerate him.35 Again the crown submitted and as did the defence, that a favourable finding in respect of rehabilitation is very much available. I think the tenor of my remarks to date would have indicated that I find the offender has done very well, responded well to the support and resources that are in the community there for him. If he continues to do so, he will probably be able to progress from needing conditions such as those I am about to impose and will be able to maintain the lifestyle that hopefully he is coming into.36 I note in his criminal antecedents that prior to this offence with which I am dealing his last offence appears to have been in 1999, a gap of some six years. Well, he should be able to enlarge that by even more before he next offends because prior to 1999 there were quite a lot of offences that were occurring. 37 But for the plea of guilty I would have set a sentence of something of the order of two years, twenty months perhaps.

    5 The total effect of the sentences passed by his Honour was a period of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years commencing 25 August 2005 and expiring 25 August 2014 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 24 August 2016. 
     
      
       
      Background facts 
       
      
    6 In order to understand the appeal and the rationale behind the sentences passed by his Honour it is necessary to set out in some detail the circumstances of each offence. The offences in count 1 all involved the same victim, who cannot be named but who is referred to as “RL”. 
     
      
    7 Just after midnight on 8 December 2004 the applicant forced open the ground floor window of the unit in which RL resided. He then made his way to the end of the victim’s bed. The victim woke up and saw him. He had a cap pulled down over his face. The victim approached the applicant and told him to get out of the house. The applicant then punched her in the mouth causing her to stumble backwards. The applicant then ordered the victim to “suck my penis”.  
     
      
    8 Fearing for her safety the victim knelt down on the bed and the applicant forced his penis into her mouth. The victim said “I can’t do this, I’m bleeding”. The victim was allowed to go to the bathroom to wash out her mouth. The applicant entered the bathroom and again forced the victim against her will to perform fellatio on him. This occurred while the victim was kneeling on the bathroom floor. 
     
      
    9 The victim was experiencing pain and said “I can’t because my lip hurts”. Despite her complaints the applicant forced her to continue. While this was occurring the applicant continually flicked a cigarette lighter on and off while holding it next to the victim’s head.  
     
      
    10 Shortly afterwards the victim was taken to the kitchen where the applicant again forced her to kneel on the floor and perform fellatio on him. After a short time the applicant ejaculated into the victim’s mouth. He was not wearing a condom. When the victim tried to wash out her mouth the applicant filled a glass up with hot water, mixed Sorbelene cream with it and then said “drink it and swallow it”. The victim drank some of it and spat the rest out. 
     
      
    11 The applicant forced the victim to pull up her panties after which he inserted his fingers into her vagina while standing behind her. Before doing so the victim saw the applicant place a small cigarette lighter on the stove. The applicant engaged in this activity for between two and five minutes in a violent fashion causing discomfort to the victim. 
     
      
    12 The victim was taken to her bedroom where she sat on her bed. The applicant sat in front of her flicking the lighter on and off in front of her face. He then lit the lighter and pushed the flame against the front of the victim’s neck causing immediate pain to her. The applicant picked up a pair of scissors waved them about and only put them down when the victim said “I’m pregnant you can’t do that”. 
     
      
    13 The applicant said to the victim “finger yourself”. He told her to take off her underpants, which she did. The victim placed her fingers into her vagina and began crying. The applicant forced her to lie down and to continue with that activity. The victim complied because she was afraid for her safety. 
     
      
    14 The applicant picked up a plastic drink bottle containing water and emptied its contents. He forced the victim to lie back on the bed on her back. He forced the small end of the plastic bottle into the victim’s vagina. 
     
      
    15 The applicant forced the victim onto her stomach and inserted a 25 cms rain stick into her vagina. He forced the stick in and out repeatedly. This caused pain to the victim who was fourteen weeks pregnant at the time. Despite the victim’s complaints of pain, the applicant continued to force the stick in and out of her vagina before stopping. The applicant then said to the victim: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’ll kill you. I know where your brother your father and your mother live. I don’t want to hurt you. I just wanted to have sex.” 
        
       
      
    16 During the whole ordeal the applicant continually demanded that the victim give him money. At some stage she handed him $15 in cash.  
     
      
    17 After the applicant left her unit, the victim was unable to sleep and early the next morning she saw her local doctor. She had a puncture injury to the lower right lip and a superficial burn to her chest near her shoulder. She was traumatised and required counselling. 
     
      
    18 Count 2. John and Rebecca Sadler and their five year old daughter occupied a cabin. John Sadler had left the premises at about 5pm. At about 12.30am on 8 December 2004 Ms Sadler heard a noise in the kitchen area. When she called out thinking it was her husband, the applicant came into her room. He was armed with a knife in his left hand and said “Just give me the car keys”. The applicant was waving the knife around and again asked for cash and the car keys. He moved the knife from hand to hand on a number of occasions and appeared agitated.  
     
      
    19 Ms Sadler directed the applicant to the living room where a laptop computer was located. By this time her daughter was in the bedroom with her, having come in when she heard voices. Her daughter was upset and crying. The applicant told Ms Sadler on a number of occasions “Shut that fucking kid up”.  
     
      
    20 When Ms Sadler went into the living room she noticed that the glass door was open. She ran from the cabin with her child and sought help nearby. She was six months pregnant at the time of the offence. The applicant took various items from the cabin. 
     
      
    21 Count 3. A number of Korean students were residents in a three bedroom double storey townhouse. At some time after 12.30am on 8 December Ms Bae was in her bedroom watching a movie. She was alone. The other girls were in another bedroom. At about 1.30am the applicant entered Ms Bae’s bedroom. He said “Don’t move give me your wallet”. He was carrying a knife in his right hand. She described it as having a black plastic handle with a silver cutting blade like a breadknife. The applicant held the knife out and touched her on the left shoulder with it. The applicant demanded that Ms Bae give him a laptop computer. He gave her the computer bag and told her to put her necklace in it. While Ms Bae was packing the bag, the applicant was holding the knife and moving it back and forth from one hand to the other.  
     
      
    22 The applicant took the computer bag, put it over his shoulder and pointed the knife at Ms Bae saying “Go”. She walked in front of the applicant and he pressed the knife into her back. She went to bedroom number two and stood in the middle of the room while the applicant searched the wardrobe and around the room. He kept pointing the knife at her. He asked Ms Bae about the third bedroom and was told that the other girls were sleeping there. The applicant said “If you’re lying I’ll kill you”.  
     
      
    23 The applicant went into the bedroom where the other girls were sleeping and turned on the light. Ms Bae followed him into the room. The applicant told her to find money and she pretended to do so while trying to wake one of the girls. There was a wallet on a desk in the room. Ms Bae took some money from the wallet. As she was handing the money to him Ms Bae noticed that the applicant was not concentrating on the knife. She grabbed the knife from his hand and threw it on the bed. The applicant then ran from the room.  
     
      
    24 Ms Bae and the other girls pursued the applicant and as he was climbing out the window, they were able to pull his jumper from him and retrieve the computer bag. 
     
      
    25 Count 4. Mr Dowsett and Ms Bull resided in a two bedroom unit on the second floor of a block of units. At about 10.15pm on 8 December 2004 Mr Dowsett noticed a light in the hallway and saw the applicant in the lounge-room. The applicant walked towards Mr Dowsett saying “I’ll stab you. I’ll stab you”. The applicant’s head was covered with a white type of t-shirt and he was motioning with what seemed to be a piece of stick. 
     
      
    26 The applicant ran to the lounge-room, picked up a laptop which was still connected to power and a printer and tried to remove it. Mr Dowsett tried to get the laptop from the applicant saying “You’re not taking that with you. Just put it back put it down”. Mr Dowsett punched the applicant on the chin and was successful in retrieving his laptop computer. 
     
      
    27 Count 5. Ms Saiko was a Japanese national on holidays in Australia. She was staying at the Park Beach Hotel/Motel in Coffs Harbour. At about 10.40pm on 8 December 2004 she heard noises outside her door. She remained seated on her bed really scared. The door suddenly burst open and the applicant was standing there. 
     
      
    28 Ms Saiko stood up and started screaming. The applicant said “Give me money or I will kill you”. He repeated this many times. The victim held her hands up to protect herself and tried to leave the room. The applicant punched her in the face, hitting her left eye near the eyebrow. She was wearing glasses which fell off and she fell to the floor unable to see. The applicant again demanded money. 
     
      
    29 The victim stood up and got her bag from near the pillow. The bag contained her wallet, about $330 in cash and other items including various credit cards, a driver’s licence and personal items. Ms Saiko then ran from the room and did not see the applicant leave her room. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    30 Having reviewed the facts his Honour noted that the applicant was only 20 years of age. He was of Aboriginal background. He had a criminal record which dated back to 2002. His convictions included a number of break and enters, take and drive a conveyance, maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm and aggravated indecent assault. On 24 December 2003 he had been sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for a break enter and steal offence. He was on parole for that offence at the time when the present offences occurred. 
     
      
    31 Evidence was given by the applicant’s grandmother. His mother was 16 when she gave birth to him. The applicant was thereafter raised by his grandmother. His mother also lived with them and the applicant thought that his mother was his sister. She died when he was 15 years of age. It was only during the last four or five years of her life that the applicant learned that she was his mother. He was apparently badly affected by her death. His grandmother said that it was only after her death that he commenced offending and using illegal drugs and abusing alcohol. 
     
      
    32 The applicant told a psychologist that when he broke into the unit of KL he had no intention of committing a sexual offence. He said that he was very drug effected and had very little memory of the actual incident. The applicant told her that he was very ashamed of what he had done and felt sorry for the victim and would apologise to her if he had the opportunity.  
     
      
    33 His Honour accepted that the applicant had pleaded guilty to a large number of charges. Although the plea of guilty was not entered at the earliest possible time its utilitarian value was considerable given the number and complexity of the charges. Accordingly his Honour allowed in the applicant’s favour the benefit of a 25 percent discount on sentence. 
     
      
    34 His Honour accepted that there was little planning in the offences. His Honour also accepted that the applicant felt genuine remorse for what he had done. His Honour took into account that the applicant’s awareness of the consequences of his actions would have been adversely effected by the drugs which he had taken. His Honour found that there were special circumstances. He identified these as the applicant’s youth and his need for rehabilitation. 
     
      
    35 A number of the offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty provided for a standard non-parole period. By reference to what this Court said in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 his Honour considered the level of seriousness of the offences. In relation to count 1(a) his Honour concluded that this offence was well above the mid range for that particular offence. He regarded the criminality in that matter as being very high. His Honour’s brief summary of the features of the count 1 offences says it all: 
     
      
       
        
        “In counts numbered 1 a young lady is at home in her bed. She is entitled to feel safe in her home. The prisoner breaks into it. He then abuses her. He commits a number of sexual offences. He punches her in the mouth. She is bleeding. He forces his penis into her mouth. He even makes her drink some mixture of cream and water. He flicks the lighter on and off. He pushes the flame against the front of her neck. He threatens her with scissors. He is told she is pregnant, although I accept that he would not have known that until he was told. He forces a stick into her vagina. He calls her a fat slut and a whore and he steals some money. His treatment of her demands a very substantial sentence.” 
        
       
      
    36 His Honour appreciated that he had to sentence for each individual offence and then determine to what extent the sentences should be cumulative and concurrent. His Honour noted that because counts 2 to 5 involved separate and discrete episodes of criminality there was a strong argument that each should be accumulated. His Honour, however, felt that the result of doing so would produce a sentence which was excessive. Accordingly his Honour built a considerable amount of concurrency into the sentences. 
     
      
    37 In view of the way in which the appeal was argued, it is necessary to have regard to what his Honour said in the sentencing proceedings when it was pointed out to him that although in relation to each individual sentence the s44 ratio was preserved as between the parole and non-parole periods, the effect of the sentences as a whole was to produce a result which had a parole period which was less than one-third of the non-parole period. His Honour said that he understood that this was so but that on the one hand he was not prepared to reduce the non-parole period because to do so would produce an inadequate sentence but on the other hand he was not prepared to increase the parole period because to do so would produce an excessive sentence (T.3-4 - 27 April 2006). 
     
      
       
      Appeal 
       
      His Honour erred with regard to the relationship between the length of the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period. 
       
      
    38 There was only one ground of appeal. 
     
      
    39 Senior counsel for the applicant put the submissions on behalf of his client succinctly and with commendable brevity. While accepting that there was no requirement under statute for the total effect of a number of sentences to reflect a parole period which was equal to or greater than one-third of the non-parole period, it was submitted that this was a result which should have occurred in this case. This was because of his Honour’s finding of special circumstances based on the applicant’s youth and the need for rehabilitation. 
     
      
    40 Having said that it was accepted on behalf of the applicant that if this Court were of the opinion that no lesser sentence should have been passed by the sentencing judge then that was the end of the matter and the appeal must fail. 
     
      
    41 It is regrettable that his Honour did not incorporate into his Remarks on Sentence the exchange with counsel which followed the passing of the sentences and to which I referred. Nevertheless in the circumstances of this case it is appropriate to have regard to what was said by his Honour since it makes clear that his Honour was well aware of the principle of totality and of the effect of the sentences which he had passed, but was not prepared to make any alteration. In other words the comparatively short parole period did not occur as a result of some oversight by the sentencing judge, but was fully appreciated by him. 
     
      
    42 There is no need to repeat or review the sequence of offences committed by the applicant on 8 December 2004. For the offences in Count 1, his Honour in his Remarks on Sentence has done this more than adequately. For most of the victims the events of this day will be indelibly imprinted on their memories. The level of criminality, both individually and cumulatively, was very high indeed. Even allowing for the applicant’s strong subjective case I am not persuaded that any lesser sentences could have been properly passed by the sentencing judge in respect of these matters. Accordingly the ground of appeal must fail. 
     
      
    43 The orders which I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal is granted. 
       
       
      (ii) The appeal is dismissed. 
       
      
    44 HALL J: I agree with Hoeben J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Dennis James Taylor, is awaiting trial in the District Court on the following charges:  
     
      
       
        
        (1) Manufacturing a large commercial quantity of MDMA (the drug commonly known as ecstasy), with an alternative count of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of that quantity of the drug.  
         
        (2) Knowingly taking part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine.  
         
        (3) Aiding and abetting the importation of prohibited tier 1 goods (safrole). 
        
       
      
    3 In preparation for his trial, there were issued on his behalf subpoenas directed to the Australian Crime Commission, the New South Wales Commissioner of Police and the Australian Customs Service to produce certain documents. On 22 September 2006 Sweeney DCJ set aside the subpoenas to the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs Service in their entirety, and the subpoena to the Commissioner of Police in large part. The applicant seeks leave to appeal, pursuant to s5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, against those decisions.  
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    4 Put shortly, it is the Crown case that in 2002 and 2003 a criminal syndicate was importing precursor chemicals for the manufacture of illegal drugs, and was later manufacturing the two drugs referred to in the indictment. It is alleged that, at the direction of a co-accused, Phillip Giam, the applicant set up an import company, through which a quantity of safrole, a precursor to ecstasy, was imported from China. It is also alleged that the applicant made available a shed at the back of his family home in Wollongong as a laboratory, in which the two drugs were manufactured by another co-accused, John Bemand.  
     
      
    5 In 2004 and 2005 respectively, Mr Bemand and Mr Giam were dealt with for their part in the criminal enterprise and were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Each of them will be a witness for the Crown at the applicant’s trial. It will be necessary to refer to particular aspects of the Crown case when dealing with the application. I shall turn first to the subpoena to the Australian Crime Commission. The subpoenas to the Commissioner of Police and the Australian Customs Service can then be considered together.  
     
      
       
      Australian Crime Commission 
       
      
    6 The subpoena to the Australian Crime Commission sought all originals or copies of telephone intercept recordings in relation to a particular mobile phone number connected in the name of the applicant. Her Honour’s judgment records that the subpoena was challenged on behalf of the Commission on the basis that it was “too broad” and that no legitimate forensic purpose for the production of the material sought by it had been shown.  
     
      
    7 There was evidence that the Commission had intercepted calls on the line, pursuant to warrants, during a period in 2003. It had been asserted from the bar table by counsel then appearing for the Commission, over the protest of counsel for the applicant, that the terms of the subpoena encompassed some eleven thousand calls. In the event, her Honour found it unnecessary to deal with the argument about the breadth of the subpoena and she set it aside upon the basis that no legitimate forensic purpose had been established. In this Court counsel for the applicant submitted that her Honour had fallen into error in her approach to that question. 
     
      
    8 A Commission document which was before her Honour asserted that “over 300 intercepted telephone conversations” were believed to “possess varying degrees of relevancy” to the present charges. They were said to have been intercepted “in connection with a non-related investigation involving Mr Taylor”. Those calls had been disclosed to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and her Honour was informed that the Crown proposed to rely on about 110 of them. 
     
      
    9 It was anticipated that Mr Bemand and Mr Giam would give evidence that the applicant was provided with a phone to be used specifically for the criminal enterprise. The forensic purpose of the subpoena advanced by counsel for the applicant was to contradict this by demonstrating, through an examination of all the intercepted calls, that the phone was used for a variety of legitimate purposes. It was also sought to identify exculpatory material in the calls whereby an innocent explanation might be provided for calls which were apparently incriminating. As I understand it, this relates, at least in part, to certain words used in the calls which were alleged to be a code for the purpose of the enterprise but which the applicant would say bore their ordinary meaning and had no sinister connotation. 
     
      
    10 These asserted forensic purposes are consistent with a statement which the applicant provided to police in 2003, in which he described an innocent relationship with Mr Bemand and Mr Giam and in which he gave an account of his use of the relevant mobile phone. Counsel for the Commission in this Court argued that the question of the codes had not been raised before her Honour. However, from a reading of the material it appears to me that it was raised, as I have said, as part of a submission relating to the identification of exculpatory material. 
     
      
    11 Her Honour referred to the principles relating to legitimate forensic purpose, citing relevant authority. The principles are familiar and were summarised by Hunt J (as he then was) in R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 17-18. The applicant is not entitled to use a subpoena as a “mere fishing expedition”, and must be able “to identify expressly and with precision the legitimate forensic purpose for which he seeks access to the documents”. Adopting the words of Gibbs CJ in Alister v The Queen (1983-84) 154 CLR 404, that test would be met if it appears to be “on the cards” that the documents would materially assist his defence. 
     
      
    12 Her Honour recorded a submission by counsel for the applicant that, if about three hundred calls were considered to be of relevance to the charges, it was “on the cards that the remaining conversations cannot be linked to criminal activity”. Counsel acknowledged that he could not identify with greater particularity what calls could assist, saying that his client had no detailed recollection of his phone calls some three years earlier. Her Honour accepted that the applicant could not be expected to remember the detail of the calls but, as a result, characterised his counsel’s submission as no better than a desire “to listen to the remaining almost 11,000 calls to see if there is anything there that will assist” him. This, she concluded, amounted to a fishing expedition, so that the applicant was unable “to satisfy the court that there is some concrete ground for a belief that the documents contain information which would materially assist the accused or that it was on the cards that they would do so”.  
     
      
    13 Before us, argument proceeded upon the basis that the applicant had to show an error in the exercise of her Honour’s discretion, in the sense explained in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. Strictly speaking, her Honour was called upon to make a judgment rather than exercise a discretion, although the two tasks are analogous for present purposes: R v Francis (2004) 145 A Crim R 233, per Simpson J at [24]-[25]. In my view, the question to be determined in the present application is whether her Honour’s finding that no legitimate forensic purpose had been shown was open to her. 
     
      
    14 In this Court counsel for the applicant relied upon three cases dealing with intercepted conversations, which do not appear to have been cited to her Honour. In State Drug Crime Commision NSW v Chapman (1987) 12 NSWLR 447, Allen J considered a provision in the State Drug Crime Commission Act 1985 to the effect that members of the Commission or of its staff were not required to produce in a court any document relating to the exercise of the Commission’s functions except where it was necessary to do so for the purposes of a prosecution instituted as a result of a Commission investigation. As a result of such an investigation, the defendants faced committal proceedings in respect of serious drug offences. They subpoenaed the Commission to produce documents which his Honour described as “of the nature of tapes of conversations intercepted by listening devices”. The Commission did not object to the production of documents relating to conversations evidence of which was to be tendered in the proceedings, but it relied upon the statutory provision to resist production of any of the other documents. 
     
      
    15 The Commission argued that the exception to the statutory immunity where it was necessary to produce documents “for the purposes of a prosecution” was confined to documents necessary to ensure the success of that prosecution. Allen J rejected this argument, holding that the exception included documents enabling the defendants to test the prosecution evidence. It is in this context that his Honour said (at 451): 
     
      
       
        
        In the present case it is manifest that there may be in the possession of the Commission records of telephone intercepts which would be of critical importance to the defendants to establish that conversations put in evidence by the prosecution had in fact innocent explanations. Indeed, in respect generally of phone tap records it is common experience that frequently it is necessary to go beyond the particular telephone conversations being immediately considered in order to get their true flavour. The other conversations have to be considered, not a selection. Yet if the argument for the Commission is correct it could adduce in these committal proceedings its own choice of conversations to be considered by the magistrate and deny to the defendants any knowledge of what the other conversations were to which they were not parties and deny them even the recollection of what they said in the conversations to which they were parties. 
        
       
      
    16 Presumably, his Honour’s reference to “telephone intercepts” was a mistake as the case appears to have been concerned with recordings by listening devices. What he said, however, is applicable to conversations intercepted by either of those means. 
     
      
    17 The procedural background to R v Gillard (1999) 76 SASR 76 need not be examined. It is sufficient to say that the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal was dealing with an interlocutory application relating to an appeal, one ground of which was that the appellant had not been supplied with recordings of the whole of a series of conversations recorded by telephone intercepts and listening devices in the investigation of the crimes of which he had been convicted. It was in this context that Duggan J, with whose judgment Lander J agreed, said at [49]-[50]: 
     
      
       
        
        Apart from the considerations which arise by reason of the fact that the appellant was tried on serious criminal charges, the circumstances of the present case give rise to important considerations of fairness. The recorded conversations obtained through the interceptions and the listening devices formed an important part of the prosecution case. Legislation of the type under consideration in this case provides an important aid in the detection and proof of crime. However this method of investigation is capable of providing both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. In my view the legislation should not be used in a manner which leads to a lop-sided approach whereby the prosecution has significantly greater access than an accused person to the recorded conversations. Generally speaking, inconvenience and the administrative difficulties involved in providing an accused person with access to this type of information should not stand in the way of disclosure to the defence.  
        
       
       
        
        I am also of the view that a request for access to information of the type under consideration in the present case should not be rejected on the ground that it is in the nature of a “fishing expedition”. The listening and interception devices were used to investigate and obtain evidence in relation to the offences with which the appellant was eventually charged. The prosecution was able to obtain a considerable body of relevant evidence from this source concerning the appellant’s alleged involvement. The potential for the appellant to uncover evidence from the same source which is relevant to his case cannot be denied. I think it is at least “on the cards” that the material will assist the appellant. 
        
       
      
    18 In a concurring judgment, Bleby J said at [77] – [78]: 
     
      
       
        
        Listening devices and telephone interceptions provide a powerful weapon in the armoury of police investigation of crime. Both are highly intrusive of a person’s privacy. Those listening to the conversations do so from a perspective of suspicion against the target. Otherwise they would not be able to use the devices. They will be alert to detect anything that may assist in proving a case against the target. They may also hear and identify conversations which tend to exculpate the target. Such conversations must necessarily be disclosed to an accused person. But a listener of the greatest possible integrity only ever hears part of the life and conversations of the target. He or she cannot know the significance of every conversation in its complete context. With the best will in the world, the listener may fail to appreciate the true significance of what in fact is an exculpatory conversation. 
        
       
       
        
        From the target’s point of view, he may well know of and be able to identify conversations which, if recorded, would be of assistance in his defence. On the other hand, he may have forgotten that he even had what turns out to be a conversation of significance to his case. An apparently irrelevant conversation at the time may well, in the light of subsequent events, assume great significance. 
        
       
      
    19 A little later, after referring again to the “power and intrusive nature of the weapon in the hands of crime investigators”, Bleby J continued at [79] to [80]: 
     
      
       
        
        Few in the community would wish to deny their right to properly controlled access to sophisticated methods in order to detect sophisticated crime. The advantages are great. But so are the responsibilities. 
        
       
       
        
        Fairness to the appellant in this case requires that just as the prosecution has gained valuable evidence from such surveillance, so should the appellant be able, if he wishes, to scrutinise the same material, or parts of it which he thinks might possibly be of assistance, in order to raise a reasonable doubt on the case against him. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    20 In Gillard at [48], Duggan J referred to an unreported decision of Ormiston J in R v Harris (unreported, Victorian Supreme Court, 3 June 1985). That was a case in which the whole of the Crown case was said to depend on inferences drawn from intercepted telephone conversations. Ormiston J directed that the accused have access to a large number of recordings of conversations which the prosecution did not intend to lead in evidence. In the course of his ruling his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        I do not accept that they can remember what they said or did in detail two or three years ago, especially when the Court knows that there are 472 relevant conversations, on the view the Crown takes, and that some 14,000 conversations have been taped from those telephone numbers in all. 
        
       
       
        
        If the activities of the accused were innocent, then the taped conversations may well provide real evidence of their innocent activities…. The privacy of the accused has been invaded and they have good reason to enquire what has been recorded of their conversations during the period of the alleged conspiracy. 
        
       
      
    21 Counsel for the Commission sought to distinguish each of these cases. He pointed out that State Drug Crime Commission v Chapman was concerned with the scope of a statutory immunity from production, rather than the notion of legitimate forensic purpose as it has been developed at common law. He noted that in Gillard the Court was considering conversations intercepted in the course of the investigation of the crimes charged, whereas in the present case the calls were intercepted in connection with an unrelated investigation. As to Harris, he relied upon the fact that, unlike the present case, the Crown case turned on inferences from the intercepted conversations. I do not consider any of these distinctions to be material. The passages quoted from all three cases contain relevant and, in my view, helpful observations about the approach to the question of legitimate forensic purpose in any case in which production of records of intercepted conversations is sought. 
     
      
    22 As I have said, her Honour does not appear to have had the benefit of these authorities. In my respectful view, her approach to the question of legitimate forensic purpose was unduly restrictive. It is most unlikely that the applicant would have been able to identify with any particularity the calls which might have assisted his case, but it was not incumbent upon him to do so. The nature of the issues raised, that is, whether the phone was used for legitimate purposes or for the purpose of the criminal enterprise, and whether conversations alleged to be incriminating (particularly those in which a code was said to be used) might be explained innocently, was sufficient to warrant the production of records of all the calls.  
     
      
    23 Accordingly, I am satisfied that it was not open to her Honour to have found that no legitimate forensic purpose was established and her ruling in respect of this subpoena must be vacated. 
     
      
       
      Commissioner of Police and Australian Customs Service 
       
      
    24 To understand her Honour’s ruling in relation to the subpoenas directed to the New South Wales Commissioner of Police and the Australian Customs Service, it is necessary to sketch some background. In February 2006 the applicant’s solicitor issued subpoenas against the Commissioner and the Customs Service to produce, among other things, all records of intelligence relating to Mr Bemand and Mr Giam. The Commissioner and the Customs Service objected to the production of documents in answer to that paragraph of each subpoena on the basis that no legitimate forensic purpose had been shown. In May 2006 Ainslie-Wallace DCJ upheld that objection and declined to order production.  
     
      
    25 It had been put to her Honour that, “through information otherwise obtained”, the applicant believed that Mr Bemand and Mr Giam had been monitored by New South Wales Police and the Customs Service over a period of years. Initially, when questioned by officers of the New South Wales Crime Commission, Mr Bemand said that, as far as he was aware, the applicant had no involvement in or knowledge of the laboratory at the home in Wollongong. It was some time later that he was visited by police and implicated the applicant, offering to give evidence against him. Counsel for the applicant had argued that the inference might be drawn that Mr Bemand‘s change of heart was because police had information about criminal activity by him which they held over his head. Access to any intelligence relating to both men was sought for a purpose of cross-examination of them on their credit.  
     
      
    26 Judge Ainslie-Wallace was of the view that “the applicant does no more than hope that there is material which might allow an attack to be made on the credibility of the witnesses against him”. She added that counsel for the applicant “could not point to any information which could assist that purpose”, and that the applicant had “no idea whether there was information relating to uncharged criminal offences of a similar kind, but assumed that there might be, based on the fact that Bemand and Giam have been monitored over the years”.  
     
      
    27 Accordingly, her Honour concluded that the relevant paragraph of each subpoena was no more than a fishing expedition. She expressed herself to be fortified in that conclusion by “the width of the terms” of the paragraph. 
     
      
    28 Noting her Honour’s comment about the way in which the paragraph was expressed, the applicant’s solicitor issued fresh subpoenas later in May 2006. Each of these subpoenas sought the production by the Commissioner and the Customs Service of information, expressed in greater detail, about Mr Bemand and Mr Giam. It is not necessary to set out the relevant paragraphs of each subpoena. It is sufficient to say that the subpoena to the Commissioner sought, among other things, a variety of documents, such as intelligence reports, incident reports and COPS entries, in relation to both men concerning a variety of dealings with prohibited drugs and precursors to prohibited drugs over a specified period. The subpoena to the Customs Service, seeking documents described as intelligence reports, information reports and investigation reports, was to much the same effect. 
     
      
    29 These subpoenas were dealt with by Judge Sweeney in her decision of September 2006. Her Honour found that they raised the same issue as that determined by Judge Ainslie-Wallace, without amplifying in any relevant way the material which had been before that judge, and she set aside the relevant paragraphs of the subpoena to the Police Commissioner and the whole of the subpoena to the Customs Service as an abuse of process. It is that decision which is the subject of the present application.  
     
      
    30 Put shortly, the applicant complained that Judge Sweeney erred in determining that the subpoenas of May 2006 were an abuse of process. It was contended that she should have assessed their forensic purpose on their merits, treating them as fresh subpoenas couched in terms significantly different from those of February 2006, and approaching them in the light of circumstances which were said to have changed since the decision of Judge Ainslie-Wallace.  
     
      
    31 This is not the occasion to examine in any detail the power of a court to revisit an interlocutory order it has made in the course of proceedings, and the circumstances in which an application to a court to do so might amount to an abuse of process. Those matters were examined at some length by the members of the Court of Appeal in Nominal Defendant v Manning (2000) 50 NSWLR 139. In that case, at [97], Foster A-JA set out a passage from the judgment of McLelland J in Brimaud v Honeysett Instant Print Pty Limited (unreported, 19 September 1988) which is often cited in this context, and upon which counsel for the Customs Service relied in the present case. Broadly speaking, whether an interlocutory decision should be reconsidered is a matter in the discretion of the court which made it, having regard to the interests of justice in the particular case while also being mindful of the need to limit the power of a party, as McLelland J put it, “to have any interlocutory application or order relitigated at will”. Factors bearing upon whether a second application is an abuse of process, but not necessarily determinative of it, are whether circumstances have materially changed between the first application and the second or whether the second application is founded upon evidence which was not reasonably available in the first.  
     
      
    32 Although strictly it is not a matter which need be determined for present purposes, I should express my view that Judge Ainslie-Wallace’s conclusion in respect of the relevant paragraphs of the first two subpoenas that no legitimate forensic purpose had been shown was one which was open to her Honour. In relation to the second subpoenas, Judge Sweeney found that the argument of counsel for the applicant about legitimate forensic purpose had not advanced beyond that which had been argued before Judge Ainslie-Wallace. She concluded that there had not been any material change of circumstances and that, although the subpoenas were expressed in different terms from those originally issued, the differences were of form rather than of substance.  
     
      
    33 Dealing with that last matter first, in relation to the subpoena to the Customs Service there was unchallenged affidavit evidence from an officer of that Service, Mr Charlwood, that, although the documents sought in the second subpoena were described differently from those sought in the first, both subpoenas in fact sought the same documents. Counsel for the Police Commissioner pointed out that the same is true of the subpoenas directed to his client, the various descriptions of the documents sought in the second subpoena being embraced by the expression “all…records of intelligence” used in the first.  
     
      
    34 Counsel for the applicant referred to Judge Ainslie-Wallace’s observation about the width of the terms of the relevant paragraphs in the first two subpoenas. He argued that this was germane to her Honour’s decision that no forensic purpose had been shown and that that deficiency was cured by the greater specificity with which the documents sought were described in the later subpoenas. However, in my view, that observation of her Honour was an aside which was not essential to her decision. That decision was founded upon the applicant’s inability to show that it was on the cards that the documents sought would disclose relevant criminal activity by the two witnesses.  
     
      
    35 Counsel for the applicant submitted that there had been a material change of circumstances since the ruling of Judge Ainslie-Wallace. Firstly, he pointed out that the current charges, which I have set out at the beginning of this judgment, were not the charges upon which his client had been committed for trial and had not been formulated at the time the matter was before her Honour. However, the committal charges were substantially the same as those now to be presented and the difference is of no significance for present purposes.  
     
      
    36 Secondly, he said that a lengthy statement by Mr Bemand had been served upon the applicant after Judge Ainslie-Wallace’s decision, and that statement disclosed other criminal activity by him and Mr Giam of the kind referred to in the later subpoenas. However, it is clear from the transcript of the argument before Judge Ainslie-Wallace that counsel was aware of that material and, indeed, that he put it to her Honour. No doubt, that was part of the “information otherwise obtained” to which her Honour referred as leading to the applicant’s belief that the two witnesses had been monitored by police and the Customs Service. However that may be, the applicant has the benefit of that material but it does not follow from it that police or the Customs Service are in possession of intelligence reports about activity of that kind.  
     
      
    37 Finally, counsel for the applicant relied upon certain material which had been disclosed by the Customs Service which was said to indicate that the Service did have intelligence about “suspected illegal importations” by Mr Giam and Mr Bemand. The tender of that material had been rejected by Judge Sweeney. It was before us by way of annexures to an affidavit of counsel’s instructing solicitor. That material was objected to by counsel for the Customs Service, but I find it unnecessary to determine that objection. The documents convey to me no more than that Mr Giam was an associate of two men who were suspected of being involved in the importation of illicit drugs or their precursors. They do not convey that the Customs Service has intelligence that Mr Giam himself (or Mr Bemand) was involved in that type of criminal activity.  
     
      
    38 Accordingly, it was open to Judge Sweeney to find that there was no relevant difference between the second subpoenas and the first, and that there was no relevant change in the material bearing on the issue of legitimate forensic purpose since the ruling of Judge Ainslie-Wallace. That being so, it was open to her Honour to find that the relevant paragraphs of the second subpoena to the Police Commissioner and the whole of the second subpoena to the Customs Service were an abuse of process. No error has been demonstrated warranting the intervention of this Court.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    39 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal in part. I would vacate Judge Sweeney’s ruling concerning the subpoena to the Australian Crime Commission and would remit that matter to the District Court to be dealt with consistently with these reasons. Otherwise I would dismiss the appeal.

      Offences and sentence 
       
      On the day appointed for the commencement of his trial, the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated break enter and intimidate in the following terms: 
       
       
        
        “On 6 July 2005 at Riverstone in the State of New South Wales in circumstances of aggravation namely being in the company of Adam David Rowe did break and enter the dwelling house of Tracey Thomas situate at 21 Riverstone Road and therein did commit a serious indictable offence namely did intimidate Tracey Thomas with intent to cause her to fear physical or mental harm.” 
        
       
       
      This offence was contrary to s112(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years. There was a standard non-parole period of 5 years. 
       
      
    3 The Court was also asked to take into account one offence on a Form 1 of malicious damage contrary to s195(a) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 5 years. 
     
      
    4 The applicant came before Knight DCJ for sentence on 9 August 2006. The sentence imposed by his Honour was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year to commence on 9 August 2006 and to expire on 8 August 2007 with a balance of term of 1 year to expire on 8 August 2008. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    5 The facts of the offences were contained in a “Statement of Facts” which was admitted without objection. Those facts were amplified by the evidence which the applicant gave in the sentence proceedings. 
     
      
    6 The victim, Tracey Thomas, resided at 21 Riverstone Road, Riverstone with her fiancé, Peter Sajkic, her two daughters aged 17 and 15 and her grand-daughter aged 2. The applicant was married to the victim’s sister. The co-offender, Mr Rowe, was the victim’s stepbrother. 
     
      
    7 On 6 July 2005 officials from the Department of Community Services had attended the applicant’s home. Apparently a complaint had been made and their attendance was in response to that complaint. The officers told the applicant that it was the victim who had been responsible for making the complaint. The DOCS officials left the applicant’s home at about 7pm. 
     
      
    8 Shortly after 8pm that night, the applicant and the co-offender arrived at the victim’s home. She was there with the family members described above. Loud banging was heard on the front door, which was accompanied by demands from the co-offender to be granted entry. After several loud bangs the front door was heard to fly open and it was subsequently discovered that the door had been broken open. 
     
      
    9 The co-offender confronted Mr Sajkic in the hallway. The applicant also entered the victim’s home but remained in the archway of the front door. The co-offender pushed and threatened Mr Sajkic and demanded to know why they had made a complaint to DOCS. The applicant demanded to speak with the victim but was told by the older daughter that he could not do so and he and the co-offender were repeatedly told to leave. Threats were levelled at the family. 
     
      
    10 The applicant and the co-offender commenced to leave the premises but on the way the co-offender threw a vase at the television causing the screen to break. A chair was also thrown at the television by the co-offender. 
     
      
    11 Additional facts emerged from the applicant’s evidence. The applicant had been drinking at his home after the DOCS officers had left. He had been joined in that activity by the co-offender. His Honour accepted that the applicant was not the person who actually broke down the door and was not the person who damaged the television set. Nevertheless his Honour found that the applicant was standing in the premises prepared to give comfort and assistance to the co-offender and that it was because of the applicant that the two of them were there in the first place. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    12 Having reviewed the facts his Honour summarised the actions of the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In effect, because you had some sort of grievance with Ms Thomas, you and your co-offender went to Ms Thomas’ home while she was in residence, broke in the door and then threatened Mr Sajkic and refused repeatedly to leave, and when you did leave the television set was damaged. A person has a right, in our society, of all places to feel secure, in their own home and you trampled over that right of Ms Thomas. In my view the offence as I say, carries very considerable criminality, notwithstanding that your role in the actual violence involved in it was less than that of Mr Rowe.” (ROS 4) 
        
       
      
    13 In relation to subjective matters his Honour noted that the applicant had been born on 26 May 1964 and was 42 at the time of sentence. The applicant did have a criminal history. He first came under police notice when he was 29 years of age and thereafter had been convicted of offences such as cultivating a prohibited plant, assault, resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty, passing valueless cheques and various driving offences including driving with a high prescribed concentration of alcohol and driving while disqualified. The applicant had not previously served a period of imprisonment. He was on a good behaviour bond for driving while disqualified at the time of these offences. 
     
      
    14 The applicant’s family had emigrated from England when he was 18 months old. His father left the family when he was 13. Not long before that the applicant had been sexually abused by his father. He was educated to year 9 level and thereafter worked as a builder’s labourer. The applicant had run his own business until a couple of months before the offence, but had been unemployed since that date. Although the applicant’s employment over the years had been somewhat intermittent, he had been able to support his family. At the time of sentence he was the father of twin 8 year old daughters, a 7 year old daughter, a 4 ½ year old son and a 9 month old son. 
     
      
    15 Because a standard non-parole period applied to this offence, his Honour had regard to what this Court said in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. His Honour did not consider that the standard non-parole period of 5 years was applicable because the applicant had entered a plea of guilty and because although the offence involved considerable criminality his Honour considered that it was significantly below the mid range of objective seriousness for offences of that kind.  
     
      
    16 Having said that his Honour still had regard to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost when determining the applicant’s sentence. His Honour also had regard to the principles in s3A and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The s21A matters essentially cancelled each other out. His Honour did, however, consider that the fact that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on a good behaviour bond was a serious aggravating feature. 
     
      
    17 His Honour found that the applicant had shown genuine remorse. His Honour was of the opinion that the plea of guilty had been entered at the earliest opportunity and that accordingly the applicant was entitled to a discount of 25 percent. The applicant had agreed to pay compensation in respect of the television set. 
     
      
    18 His Honour concluded his remarks as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences determined by me and having regard also to the subjective factors to which I have referred, and to the principle of using the five year non-parole period as a guidepost, I have come to the conclusion that no sentence other than one of a custodial nature would be appropriate. Your counsel urged on me, having regard to the statistics for offences of this nature, that this was a case which could be dealt with either by way of a suspended sentence or periodic detention, and it is certainly true than some 10 percent of offenders who have pleaded guilty to a s112(2) offence, have received a suspended sentence plus supervision, and 3 percent have received periodic detention, whilst 86 percent have been sent to fulltime custody. 
        
       
       
        
        I have given the matter much thought. It is not an easy task for a sentencing judge to send a man of 42 years of age to gaol for the first time but I have come to the conclusion that the real nature of this offence was such that the community would be horrified were it to think that anything other than a fulltime custodial sentence would be appropriate. That is because, in truth as I have pointed out already, you and your co-offender literally invaded Ms Thomas’ house and then therein, did the acts to which I have already referred. It seems to me that that is an offence which does require a fulltime custodial sentence and I decline therefore to deal with it either by way of periodic detention or by way of home detention.” (ROS 12-13) 
        
       
       
      Appeal 
       
      Ground of appeal 1: The sentencing judge erred in concluding that fulltime custody was the only available option in this case. 
       
      
    19 It was submitted that in concluding that fulltime custody was the only available option, his Honour had failed to have adequate regard to the applicant’s strong subjective case, that he was the father of five children and that he had not previously served a sentence of imprisonment. 
     
      
    20 This ground of appeal does no more than challenge his Honour’s exercise of his sentencing discretion. His Honour considered carefully and in some detail the very matters which are raised in support of this ground of appeal. His Honour then carefully considered whether non-custodial options were appropriate and concluded that they were not. His Honour’s reasoning was precisely that recommended by this Court in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. No error in his Honour’s approach has been demonstrated. This ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground of appeal 2: The sentencing judge erred by concluding that fulltime custody was warranted because “the community would be horrified were it to think that anything other than a fulltime custodial sentence would be appropriate”. 
       
      
    21 It was submitted that his Honour erred in taking into account this consideration. The question of whether or not “the community would be horrified”, it was submitted, was an irrelevant consideration and by taking it into account his Honour had fallen into error. Criticism was also levelled at his Honour’s use of the term “invade”. It was submitted that by using this word to characterise the behaviour of the applicant, his Honour was confusing the actions of the applicant with those of his co-offender.  
     
      
    22 In my opinion no error on the part of his Honour has been identified. By referring to community outrage his Honour was doing no more than taking into account that right minded members of the community would regard the criminality of this offence as such that it ought be denounced by a sentence of imprisonment. It is not without significance that in the context of what part antecedent criminal history should play in the sentencing process that the High Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Counsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner’s claim for leniency. That is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community’s understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalty.” ( 
        Veen v The Queen (No 2) 
         (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 at 477-78.) 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour did not confuse the part played by the applicant with that of the co-offender. His Honour was careful in his recitation of the facts to differentiate their conduct. Insofar as the applicant is concerned, he instigated the incident, although he did not personally break open the door he then entered the house albeit not to a great extent. He threatened the victim and refused to leave when requested. There is nothing in his Honour’s characterisation of the conduct of the applicant which revealed error. This ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case. 
       
      
    24 The submissions in support of this ground were the same as those in support of ground 1. As indicated, no error has been identified in his Honour’s reasoning process nor in his exercise of his sentencing discretion. Not only was the objective criminality of the offence significant but his Honour had to have regard to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost, to the fact that the applicant was on a good behaviour bond at the time of the offence and to the Form 1 matter. This ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    25 The Court was advised that the applicant’s co-offender has not yet been sentenced. It was submitted that when the co-offender is sentenced a parity question may arise, which could be availed of by the applicant. In those circumstances if the Court was against the applicant’s submissions on this application it was asked to refuse leave to appeal but not dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    26 The order which I propose is: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal is refused. 
       
      
    27 HALL J: I agree with Hoeben J.

    JUDGMENT1. Mr Simpson, on behalf of his client, has made various applications regarding the admissibility of the ERISP conducted between the police and his client on 29 July 2005. Those applications have been made under s 85 of the Evidence Act 1995 as well as s90, s138 and s139. A good deal of evidence was tendered in the form of exhibits in respect of this application and, in addition, evidence from witnesses was called. I propose to briefly review the evidence of the witnesses who were called. 2. Detective Whitton was called by the Crown and cross-examined by Mr Simpson. In cross-examination she said that the accused was obviously concerned in respect of his arrest but not overly anxious. She was aware that he was not given any medication but she also was not aware of any request by this accused for any medication. She agreed with Mr Simpson that there was an added need to be cautious if there was a mental health issue associated with a suspect but she repeated she did not recall Mr El Mostafa asking for medication. 3. She indicated that she had no personal awareness of his mental health situation or medication and that the appropriate duty for a police officer to deal with those issues is when an accused person asks for a doctor. If she had thought that there were mental health issues, she would have checked his demeanour during the course of the record of interview. 4. Just before the commencement of the record of interview Detective Whitton acknowledged that Mr El Mostafa had asked for a legal representative to be present and during the course of the interview he stated that he did not want to answer without a lawyer. She was not sure whether he repeated that request after the record of interview. She was quite sure that he had said that he did not want to answer. 5. She acknowledged that she knew of another name by which the accused was known and that was Abu Fajr. When she was recalled yesterday she said to Mr Simpson in cross-examination that she had been aware from 4 February 2005 onwards, or she had understood, that the person named Abu Fajr was Mr El Mostafa. She also acknowledged that when the record of interview was conducted on 29 July 2005 she and her colleagues were well aware that his name was Amir El Mostafa. At the same time she acknowledged that there had been some confusion about the identity of the accused brought about during the course of a search of his premises. 6. Returning to her evidence which had been given on 20 March 2007 before me she said, once again in response to cross-examination, when she put the allegations concerning the offence to Mr El Mostafa and he made clear that he did not wish to answer, she said that she moved on. She said frankly that she hoped that Mr El Mostafa would say things which would assist the investigation and that included acknowledging that his nickname was Abu Fajr. She said that they had other forms of identification but were not sure of his correct identification and she said that she wanted him to admit, for the purposes of the investigation, that his name was Abu Fajr. 7. Asked whether she thought that she pushed a little too hard she said that she did not think so. Asked about the interpreter she said that she relies upon an interpreter to do their duty, that being the system which she relies upon. 8. She acknowledged the various questions and answers during the course of the record of interview in which Mr El Mostafa sought the assistance of a lawyer. She said it was clear to her that he wanted a lawyer. 9. In respect of questions during the course of the record of interview touching upon his request for participation in a line-up, she acknowledged that Mr El Mostafa was getting anxious around that point in the interview and that she had some genuine concern for his position and said that that is why she made so many attempts, including ringing the lawyer access line, which she said is highly unusual for police to go to those lengths. 10. Detective Sergeant Day was next called by the Crown Prosecutor. His evidence in chief was that Mr El Mostafa appeared very calm at his house. He also realised that he, Detective Sergeant Day, knew at every stage that Mr El Mostafa wanted legal advice. He was not aware at Mr El Mostafa's home that there was any mental health issue or medication issue and he was not sure at what stage he became aware of any mental health or medication issue. 11. He acknowledged that he was the senior officer involved at the stage of the interview. He could not recall if the custody manager at the police station had mentioned medication. It was important for him to know because that would involve a protocol so far as that kind of illness was concerned and he would seek advice, particularly if an illness such as schizophrenia was involved. 12. Asked in cross-examination about Mr El Mostafa's demeanour he answered that the demeanour changed during the course of the interview in that he became less compliant during the process and that his mood changed from when they first met to when they finished. 13. He acknowledged frankly that before the record of interview it was quite clear that Mr El Mostafa did not want to answer questions so far as the allegation was concerned but insofar as other matters he thought that he was agreeable to answering questions. He acknowledged that one thing that he hoped the record of interview would achieve was an admission that Mr El Mostafa was Abu Fajr. He was quite happy to obtain an admission to that effect which is why the name question was asked. Asked whether he considered the asking and answering of the question about the name (which he acknowledged was an admission which would assist the investigation) was a fair question, given his desire for a lawyer, he said that he regarded it as fair. Insofar as the questions concerning the process of an identification line-up were concerned Detective Sergeant Day made it clear that he wanted a clear ""no"" from the suspect so that there was no doubt about his answer to that question. 14. Had he known about any mental illness such as schizophrenia he said that the questions would not have changed but would have been done on the advice of a medical practitioner and perhaps at a later time and that there were other issues about the true name of Mr El Mostafa. 15. Mr Simpson called his client, Mr Amir El Mostafa, to give evidence before me. He said that he had been prescribed medication for depression and also for schizophrenia. He normally kept the medication on the top of the television and normally took one of the medications a day but also two when they were needed. Asked what would happen if he did not take his medication he said he would feel very uncomfortable and unstable and unbalanced in talking. He can feel something in his chest, a tightness psychologically affecting him. He cannot talk properly and he loses his temper easily. 16. Mr El Mostafa said he could not recall whether he told the police at his home regarding the medication. Asked whether he told anyone at the police station regarding his mental illness and medication he said that he did tell them that he was sick and needed to take his medication and that his medication was at home. He did not recall to whom he gave that information. 17. He was not given medication before the record of interview nor was he given it afterwards. Before the record of interview he was told he could speak to a lawyer. He was told that a lawyer would be brought and he wanted to bring his own. He had some unsuccessful attempts to contact a lawyer of his own but spoke to a person named Liam who was contacted by the police and to whom Mr El Mostafa spoke. 18. Liam told him he was very busy and could got come and gave him advice about how to deal with the police whilst he waited for a lawyer to arrive. The advice was about not talking about anything because he does not understand the legal issues. He acknowledged that during the interview he was very nervous and tense because of his lack of medication. 19. Before the record of interview he said he told the police that he wanted to wait for his lawyer. Asked why by Mr Simpson he said that he did not know anything regarding the law and when the interview started he believed he had to answer all the questions. He said that the police were putting pressure on him. He felt pressured and he told them he felt pressured at the end. He told them many times, he said, that he wanted a lawyer and kept saying that he was not willing to answer questions but they kept asking questions again and again. 20. In cross-examination he said his medication included Zoloft prescribed by a Dr M Saeed. Asked why he did not take his medication to the police station he said they did not let him, they just allowed him to get dressed and that was it. He could not remember how many calls he had made to try to speak to a lawyer but he felt, he repeated, under pressure to answer questions. 21. Asked when in the record of interview he first felt the pressure to answer questions he said ""when they kept insisting and I kept repeating I wasn't going to talk unless a lawyer was present"". 22. The record of interview itself was played before me. My observations of Mr El Mostafa during the course of the interview was that he appeared composed from the start. He occasionally spoke English. I did not regard the police as overbearing but they were persistent in their questions. Mr El Mostafa made it clear very early in the interview that he wanted a lawyer and he did not give the outward appearance of suffering from a great deal of pressure. Further in cross-examination he said he was impatient to finish. Asked why he answered the questions about his name, he said they gave him the choice to give my name or not so I gave them the name to get rid of the situation. So he chose to answer the question. He wanted to finish everything and leave. They were, he said, really constant and really persisted to get the answers and he acknowledged that he did not say during the course of the interview that he was waiting for medication or that he had asked for medication. 23. Mr Simpson called Dr Karima Attia-Soliman, known as Dr Soliman. She is a medical practitioner and sees only psychiatric patients and has a specialty in that area. She said she saw Mr El Mostafa on 28 April 2003. Her diagnosis was of schizoaffective disorder as well as chronic depression and grief. She prescribed various medications including Resperidon which is an antipsychotic and a packet of which had been tendered during the evidence. Between May 2003 and August 2004 she saw Mr El Mostafa eight times. She had prescribed Abilify in respect of his psychosis and Avanza in respect of his depression. In respect of schizophrenia she said that it cannot be cured and if untreated a schizophrenic person may feel paranoid and isolate themselves, and such a person should take medication every day. 24. She was asked to assume that he had taken his tablets since May 2005 up to the morning of 29 July 2005 and had then been arrested and gone to the police station to be interviewed without his medication that morning or during the course of the morning. Asked what the likely effects of the absence of medication in that sort of environment, she repeated that a person with schizophrenia can feel very paranoid and may become more florid and it can be reflected in heightened anxiety which would accompany such symptoms and in sweaty palms or even shouting and screaming. 25. She said in cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor it was consistent with his condition that he did not feel like talking to anyone anymore because schizophrenic patients do not like to be exposed. 26. I do not see the need to resolve any factual issues in this case or at least on these applications. It is clear to me that Mr El Mostafa's first language is not English and that he needed an interpreter to be interviewed by the police. It is clear that he was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and depression and that he was prescribed medication in respect of those conditions. It is clear that he sought a lawyer and had limited access to a lawyer by telephone and made it clear to the police that he did not want to answer questions without consulting a lawyer. It is clear from the custody management record that certain police at the police station where he was interviewed knew that he had a psychiatric condition and indeed that the management record included a reference to a previous attempt at suicide. 27. I am not satisfied that either police officer who interviewed Mr El Mostafa knew of his mental health condition before the interview or of his need for medication. To that extent there appeared to be a breakdown of the procedures within the police station whereby the significant contents of the custody management record were not drawn to the attention of the interviewing police the interview. 28. Based upon that evidence Mr Simpson's first application is made under s 85 of the Evidence Act. I do not propose to set out the terms of the section and I rely upon Mr Simpson, if need be, to explain the terms of the section to his client. I note that s 85 is limited to an admission. In that respect I regard the relevant portions of the record of interview as those concerning the answers he gave to questions about his name. I do not regard the answers given concerning the procedure for a line-up as constituting admissions. 29. Mr Simpson's application was for a ruling under s 85 that the answer given by his client specifically to question 19 in the ERISP was inadmissible (and I acknowledge that his application covers the whole of the ERISP). But as I have just said under s 85 the portion I regard as an admission concerns the name and the answer given to question 19 that he was also known by the name of Abu Fajr. Mr Simpson submitted that that answer should not be admissible because the court could not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the circumstances in which that answer was given were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. 30. In referring to s 85(3)(a) Mr Simpson relied upon his client's non-English speaking background and the evidence of his mental illness as well as hearsay evidence that his client had been imprisoned in Iraq. He acknowledged that there was no s 85(3)(b)(ii) threat or promise or inducement and that there was not a lot that could be said in respect of s 85(3)(b)(i), namely the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put. I agree with that.  Mr Simpson argued that the issue:   
     
      
       
       ""...having all that material to decide whether or not the admission made, that is the answer to the question regarding his nickname, was such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected."" 
       
      
    That was Mr Simpson's description of the issue. The Crown bears the onus on the balance of probabilities of demonstrating that unlikelihood and Mr Simpson also drew my attention to the evidence of Dr Soliman.  
     
      
    31. On the other hand, the Crown Prosecutor first pointed out that there was no evidence before the court in any form that Mr El Mostafa had been tortured in Iraq. Furthermore, he pointed out that Mr El Mostafa was assisted during the ERISP by an interpreter at all material times. He pointed to Mr El Mostafa's demeanour as demonstrated during the interview. He pointed to an example of an appropriately answered question referred to by Dr Soliman. He argued that the evidence pointed to the accused becoming impatient and bored during the ERISP, but nothing to suggest he was suffering from a psychotic episode. 32. The Crown Prosecutor pointed out that the accused elected to answer the question about his name during the ERISP and after he had spoken to a solicitor, named Liam, on the phone, so he was not uninformed or overborne by a police officer. The Crown Prosecutor also pointed to evidence given by the accused before me about why he had answered the question about his name, namely:  
     
      
       
      ""...because they gave me the choice to give my name or not. So because I wanted to get rid of everything, I just did, I just gave them my name.""  
      
    That answer should be seen in the context that he had earlier and later during the ERISP exercised his right not to answer questions.  
    33. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the circumstances in which Mr El Mostafa answered the question about his name were such as to make it unlikely the truth of the admission was adversely affected. He had the assistance of an interpreter. He had previously had access to legal advice and was aware that he could decline to answer questions. He did not give the appearance on the ERISP tape of being confused; nor did his behaviour demonstrate anything which might point to some psychotic episode. The question itself was not complex and indeed it was a simple and fundamental question. For these reasons I am satisfied that the circumstances in which he admitted that he was also known as Abu Fajr were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. 34. Mr Simpson's next application was under s 90 of the Evidence Act and made in respect of the whole of the ERISP. In my opinion the relevant components of the ERISP are the answers given by Mr El Mostafa concerning his name and the questions and answers concerning the identification line up. In my opinion s 90 applies to both those sections. It applies to the admissions concerning his name because s 90 applies to ""an admission"" and it applies to the answers given concerning the line up because the section also applies to ""evidence to prove a particular fact"". 35. The fact in question here would be whether or not Mr El Mostafa refused the opportunity for a line up. Once again I do not propose to set out the terms of the section and rely upon Mr Simpson to point those terms out to his client, if need be. 36. As the current authority in this state for the interpretation of that section, both parties referred me to Regina v Sophear Em [2003] NSWCCA 374, a judgment of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. The leading judgment was given by Howie J, with whom Ipp JA agreed and Hulme J substantially agreed. 37. Mr Simpson, based on that authority, submitted that neither the probative value of the proposed evidence, nor the seriousness of the offence are relevant considerations and I agree that those propositions are found in [110] and [113] respectively of Howie J’s reasons. Accordingly, I accept that submission. Both counsel have also referred me to [104] of Howie J's reasons in that judgment in which Howie J said the following regarding the general effect of s 90: 
     
      
       
       ""Section 90 in effect confers on the trial judge a discretion to reject evidence of admissions where to admit them would result in an unfair trial for the accused. It is unfairness arising from the use of the admissions by the prosecution that is central to the discretion under the section and not whether the police unfairly treated the accused. The purpose of the discretion is the protection of the rights and privileges of the accused. It is concerned with the right of an accused to a fair trial and includes a consideration of whether any forensic advantage has been obtained unfairly by the Crown from the way the accused was treated. There may be an overlap between issues of voluntariness, reliability, fairness to the accused and the public policy discretion."" 
       
      
     I have omitted references to authority made by his Honour. 38. Mr Simpson posed the question whether it was appropriate for persons with a diagnosed mental illness and not speaking English to be the subject of a record of interview where a deliberate attempt was made to obtain an admission, when that person asked for a lawyer. It is important to note in regard to Mr Simpson's submissions that the focus of the s 90 discretion is the use of the admission in the trial by the prosecution. Mr Simpson further submitted that s 90 includes what was formerly known as the public policy discretion. This is true, as Howie Jacknowledged in Em, at [104], but the section of the Evidence Act which most closely reflects the public policy discretion is s 138: see the discussion of Howie J over [74] to [75] of Em. 39. An aspect of the way in which the evidence may be used unfairly against his client so far as the admission concerning his name is concerned was, Mr Simpson argued, that witnesses at the trial are likely to identify his client by reference to the name Abu Fajr. A number of those witnesses did not know his client personally, but by reputation and that reputation included the person known as Abu Fajr handing out material which said hateful things about Shi'ites. Hence Mr Simpson argues in challenging the veracity of those identifications, Mr El Mostafa may have to delve into some of that background knowledge. 40. Furthermore, Mr Simpson pointed to the answers to question 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the ERISP. Those questions and answers are as follows: 
     
      
       
      ""Q5. Do you agree that prior to this interview commencing, I told you that I intended to ask you further questions which, together with your answers, would be electronically recorded? 
       
      A. I don't wanna answer because I need a lawyer.  
       
       
      Q6. Okay, these are just the preliminary questions. I understand you don't want to answer any questions about the allegations. Just at this stage you are just going through whether you agree that prior to us turning the tapes on, did we tell you that it was going to be recorded? 
       
      A. No, I don't - no, I don't, I believe. 
      
     
     
      
      Q7. That we told you that it was going to be recorded on the three tapes and the videotape, we explained that?  
       
      A. This I agree to. 
      
     
     
      
      Q8. Okay? 
       
      A. But I don't agree to answer to the allegations because I don't know about the."" 
       
      
    41. I might add here that there is a separate question about the interpretation of the questions and answers. Mr Simpson argues that after his client objected to answering questions (see Q5), he was reassured by the police that they understood that he did not want to answer any questions about the allegations, but that they would proceed with ""just the preliminary questions"". Those preliminary questions then included not only his name, but whether he was known by any other name, to which he replied ""Abu Fajr"". 42. The Crown Prosecutor argues that Mr El Mostafa did exercise his right to silence when he wished to stop. He referred me to Regina v Pham (2001) 123 ACrimR 30 and the judgment of the then Chief Judge at Common Law, Wood CJ at CL, with whom the present Chief Judge, then McClellan J, agreed. There it was said that there is:  
     
      
       
      ""...no absolute rule that an interview conducted in the face of an objection by a suspect, or continued in the face of an indication that he or she does not wish to participate any further in it, should be rejected if tendered in evidence."" 
      
    Wood J said at [56]: 
     
      
      ""Each case must be determined on its own facts, and in particular by reference to the extent to which there is any unfair pressure placed upon the person being interviewed, or unfair advantage taken of his position, for example because of his age, vulnerability, lack of familiarity with the English language and so on. Moreover, in any weighing exercise the probative value of the evidence needs to be taken into account."" 
       
      
    43. I have previously indicated that in respect of the probative value I propose to follow the more recent Court of Criminal Appeal decision in Em. The Crown Prosecutor argued that the police in this case were trying to identify the man they were interviewing. There had been some uncertainty because of documents located in the accused's wallet and at the premises. There was nothing observable in the interview which could be described as unfair, pressurised or unduly repetitious. 44. In my opinion it would not be unfair to Mr El Mostafa to use the evidence of the admission of his name, having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made. Those circumstances will be the subject of closer examination by me when I consider the application made under s 138 of the Evidence Act, but include his mental health condition and the fact of his need for medication and the fact that his first language was not English, as well as his persistent requests for a lawyer. However, as Howie J said in Em, the focus of s90 is the use of the admissions in the course of the trial. Mr Simpson pointed to the cross-examination of potential witnesses about the name Abu Fajr and how they came to know that name. It seems to me that it will be inevitable that there will be a degree of cross-examination in any event regarding the name Abu Fajr. 45. The Crown proposes to call a number of purported eyewitnesss who will identify the accused Mr El Mostafa by reference to descriptions and by reference to the name Abu Fajr. If Mr Simpson proposes to challenge those identifications, it will be necessary for him to delve into those areas in any event. 46. I acknowledge the force of the submission that s 90 prescribes an unfairness but in my opinion that unfairness needs to be taken in the context in which the evidence will be used in the course of the trial. Also, as the Crown Prosecutor said, evidence led by witnesses who will identify the accused Mr El Mostafa by reference to photographs may well have to be the subject of the same kind of cross-examination. 47. Insofar as application was made under s 90 by Mr Simpson for the evidence concerning the line up interview not to be admitted against his client, I cannot see any basis upon which it would be unfair to his client to use that evidence in the course of this trial. 48. I turn now to the applications made by Mr Simpson under ss 138 and 139 of the Evidence Act. Once again I do not propose to read out those sections for the reasons which I have indicated previously. Mr Simpson argued what he said was the threshold point of impropriety under s 138(1). If he was successful in convincing me that there was impropriety, then he correctly points out that the onus falls on the Crown in accordance with that subsection to convince me of the desirability of admitting the evidence by reference to the weighing process specified. 49. Mr Simpson's submission was that the evidence in the ERISP was obtained improperly because of a combination of his client's mental health condition and need for medication and as well as his client's express request for a lawyer and finally his client's lack of English as a primary language. Mr Simpson made it clear that the most important of those issues was his client's mental state. In this regard he pointed to the documentary evidence of the custody record which indicated a mental illness and a previous attempted suicide and he submitted that regardless of whether the interviewing police were aware of that record, they ought to have been made aware of it before the interview. As he said, ""They ought to have been advised of the fact that he had a mental illness and was, on his own account, on medication"". 50. This circumstance was aggravated by the fact that English was his second language and his persistent requests not to be interviewed without a lawyer. Mr Simpson further argued in reliance on s 139 of the Evidence Act that the caution was not adequately translated and therefore was a deemed impropriety by virtue of s 139(1) and s 139(3) of the Evidence Act. There is some substance in that submission, in that it is apparent from exhibit VDEM 28 that there has been an omission of part of a caution and some other minor inadequacies in interpretation. 51. However, I note that in Regina v Taylor [1999] ACTSC 47 Higgins J, as the Chief Justice then was, said as follows: 
     
      
       
       ""In my view, because it is, albeit deemed, improper for a police officer (or other relevant official) to omit a caution, or to deliver a caution where the person cautioned will not comprehend it, it seems to me that the caution will fail to satisfy s 139(3), if the circumstances are such that the officer knows, or ought to know, that the caution has not been understood. However, there is no such failure if a reasonable person in the position of the officer, acting with proper respect for the rights of suspects, did not and could not reasonably have been expected to perceive that the suspect did not understand the caution."" 
       
      
     
     
     I respectfully agree with his Honour's judgment and I do not regard any deemed impropriety as arising in the circumstances of this case.  
    52. The Crown Prosecutor initially submitted that: ""There is a perceived degree of impropriety within the bounds of s 138(3)"". However, he appeared to alter that submission and submit ""There was no impropriety which would attract s 138"". As to the English language issue, he pointed out that Mr El Mostafa had an interpreter available and he accepted that there was, within the knowledge of the police at the police station, the fact that Mr El Mostafa had a mental illness; it was, he said, indicated on the custody record. However, he said that the medication had been prescribed some years before. The only behavioural indications during the interview were consistent with boredom and impatience which had been acknowledged by Mr El Mostafa. 53. As to the questioning of the accused about his nickname after he had indicated his desire not to answer questions because he needed a lawyer, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that was a relevant question for two reasons: the first was that the police had evidence of a number of different identities and they needed to pin down by which names this particular interviewee was known; the second reason was related to the investigation and was because, as both police officers conceded in evidence, it was important for their investigation to establish that the man they were interviewing, whom they suspected of being involved in the riotous events, was also known as Abu Fajr. 54. As the Crown Prosecutor said, the answer given in the ERISP ""is in fact an admission that the Crown would be relying on"". The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the need to sort out the ""multiplicity of identities is not tainted in terms of impropriety by the fact that it did have an investigative aspect to the question"". 55. In my opinion, the evidence obtained in response to questions 18 to 22 was obtained improperly. I am of this view for two reasons. The first is that the custody management record clearly indicates that the interviewee had a mental illness and had previously attempted suicide. That ought to have been drawn to the attention of the interviewing officers. As Detective Sergeant Day acknowledged, had he been aware that Mr El Mostafa suffered from schizophrenia, he would have sought advice as to whether to continue with the interview process, or have a doctor see him. To my mind the fact that the interview proceeded despite the contents of the custody management record, was an impropriety. I do not have an evidentiary basis to attribute that to either of the interviewing officers and nor do I attribute it to them, but it appears to be a result of a breakdown in an internal police procedure. 56. The second reason for my view that there was an impropriety arises from questions and answers 5 and 6. I have previously set out the terms of those questions and answers. Mr El Mostafa had made it clear that he did not want to answer questions because he needed a lawyer. The response of Detective Whitton was somewhat reassuring, indicating to him that ""These are just the preliminary questions"". She acknowledged that he did not want to answer any questions ""about the allegations"". She suggested there was a formal procedure of confirming what had previously occurred. That was followed by a series of formal questions about his name but when the questions about the name went into the area of whether he was known by any other name, that in my opinion became improper. It became improper because the police officers in their evidence before me frankly acknowledged that establishing that the interviewee was Abu Fajr was a significant step. 57. In my opinion there is a sense in which that question was part of the substantive allegations against the interviewee. If the interviewee was indeed Abu Fajr then an important component of the police case was made out. I think Mr El Mostafa could have been misled by the distinction between ""the preliminary questions"" and questions ""about the allegations"". The result was that the police obtained a very significant piece of information about the allegations against the interviewee despite his desire not to answer questions about the allegations. 58. That little piece of information came in the form of what otherwise would be regarded as innocuous questions about his name. So far as the evidence obtained in response to questions 59 to 64 concerning the identification parade is concerned, in respect of any deemed impropriety as a result of s 139 I hold the same view as previously expressed. I regard the presence of an interpreter as the best the police could do in interviewing a non-English speaking suspect in the circumstances. 59. It is clear Mr El Mostafa understood the questions and answered these questions with reasons. These questions are not infected by the impropriety concerning the suspect's name. These questions concerned a procedure which the police needed to ask the suspect about. As question 59 says: ""What we need to ask you is…"". However, these questions are unaffected by the impropriety of the police custody management record pointing expressly to a mental health issue, but I regard the desirability of admitting this particular evidence, the answers to questions 59 to 64, as outweighing the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 60. I take into account in this regard that the charges faced by Mr El Mostafa are serious and the circumstances of the alleged offence were serious and the impropriety appeared to result from an administrative error. In any event the impropriety in this regard concerns specifically the lack of attention given to his mental state, but the answers given to this particular part of the series of questions by Mr El Mostafa were, as I have said, very rational and responsive and I take that into account as well. 61. Returning to the questions and answers concerning the name, having found that that evidence was obtained by an impropriety, it then becomes inadmissible ""unless the desirability of the admitting of the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained"". This includes consideration of the factors listed in s138(3) which were addressed by counsel. 62. The Crown Prosecutor submitted in accordance with (a) that the probative value of the evidence was high because it formed a basis or at least one basis for later identification evidence. As to (b) the Crown Prosecutor described the evidence as important. As to (c) he said that the nature of the offences for which the accused faces trial involved a very serous matter that occurred in a public street late at night. He submitted in respect to (d) that the gravity of the impropriety involved ""is very much at the lighter end"". He linked that to the reasons for asking the identity question, one being the multiplicity of identities. The Crown Prosecutor frankly acknowledged consistently with the evidence that, so far as (e) is concerned, the impropriety was not so much reckless as deliberate in that the officer admitted that there was an investigative aspect. There was no basis for a submission in respect of (f) or (g). As to (h) the Crown Prosecutor said the difficulty of obtaining the evidence has been through the photographic identification. As he said, as it stands right now the Crown does not have any evidence except for the nexus of the photographic identification. However, it is the case that the photographic identification is now admissible. 63. Mr Simpson's submission in respect of (a) was that the probative value was not particularly high and concerned only a nickname. As to (b) he acknowledged that the evidence was clearly important to the Crown case because it can link up with the photographic identification. He submitted that the maximum of 15 years for the offence of riot placed the relevant offence in the mid range so far as clause (c) is concerned. He submitted that the gravity of the impropriety was high. He said that police were entitled to ask questions to see if answers would assist but there was a limit on that entitlement. His client made it clear a number of times that he wanted a lawyer. He agreed with the Crown in respect of (e) that the impropriety was deliberate and he made no submission in respect of (f) or (g). So far as (h) was concerned he asked rhetorically who knows, if he had been afforded an opportunity to be questioned in the presence of a lawyer, whether his client might have assisted the police. He submitted that the process was unfair in all the circumstances. 64. I regard the probative value of the evidence as high. It is a direct admission by an accused person of an evidentiary aspect of the case against him which is significant. The evidence may or may not be important in the proceedings and, now that the identification evidence is likely to be admitted, it is likely to assume less importance in the proceedings. 65. However the offence charged is a serious one. It is a significant public order offence. The subject matter of the proceeding in this case concerns an alleged riot on a public street involving the discharge of a firearm. I do not regard the impropriety of interviewing Mr El Mostafa, despite his mental conditions, as grave because I am not convinced that the interviewing police knew about it at the relevant times. Nor do I regard the impropriety of asking the question about the nickname as very grave, although it ought not to have been asked after the reassurance about the formality of the questioning. 66. The police were entitled to press their questions to a certain extent despite the suspect's express desire not to answer questions, but they should have been alert to the fact that the questions on his name drifted from formal to substantive after he was told they were ""just the preliminary questions"". To this extent in my opinion the questioning process probably lulled Mr El Mostafa into a false sense of security.67. In the circumstance of the case the identity of the suspect by reference to the name Abu Fajr was important and he had been reassured that he would not be asked about the allegations. Despite the significance of the offence and the circumstances of the offence and the significant probative value of the evidence I regard the desirability of it being admitted as not outweighing the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which this evidence was obtained. I take into account that the impropriety involved in questioning about the nickname ought not to have occurred. The suspect's mental state was unlikely to have been within the knowledge of the police but as I said the impropriety concerning the questioning after the reassurance ought not to have occurred. 68. Accordingly, in respect of Mr Simpson's various applications, I reject his application made under s85 of the Evidence Act in respect of the whole of the ERISP. I reject his application made under s85 of the Evidence Act in respect of that part of the ERISP which arguably amounts to an admission, namely the answers concerning his client's name. I reject his application made under s90 of the Evidence Act concerning the whole of the ERISP. I reject his argument that there is a deemed impropriety because of the translation issue, the deemed impropriety coming about by the operation of s139 of the Evidence Act. 69. In respect of his application under s138 of the Evidence Act in respect to the whole of the ERISP I reject that but insofar as that application refers to questions and answers 18 through to and including 22 I grant his application and rule that that evidence is not to be admitted in this case.

    JUDGMENT1. The Crown Prosecutor intends to call certain witnesses in this trial who will identify the accused, Mr El Mostafa, by evidence that they saw him at the scene of the alleged riot. The evidence of identification will be by description and also, I understand, by evidence that they recognised him by one means or another. On this application the Crown Prosecutor tendered statements from those witnesses which I marked VDEM 33. In addition Detective Whitton was called and gave evidence. 2. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the evidence did not amount to visual identification evidence. I disagree with that submission. The evidence clearly amounts to identification evidence relating to an identification based wholly or partly on what the respective witnesses saw. 3. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that in accordance with s 114(2) of the Evidence Act 1995, that he was released from such evidence being inadmissible because it would not have been reasonable to have held a parade. I reject that submission because the police in fact proceeded to use photographic identification so that they clearly regarded it as important to take the investigation a further step. 4. That left the crown prosecutor relying upon s 114(2)(c) in that Mr El Mostafa was said to have refused to take part in an identification parade. He relied upon the answers given by Mr El Mostafa to questions 59 through to 64 inclusive of exhibit VDEM 1, the record of interview. 5. In my opinion those answers amount to an unqualified assertion by Mr El Mostafa that he did not desire to take part in a process of identification by an identification parade and it amounted to a refusal to take part in such a parade. Not only did he refuse in clear terms but he gave reasons. 6. I should add that Mr Simpson expressed some concern about those reasons being tendered into evidence before the jury. I can understand that concern. The Crown Prosecutor indicated that he would turn his mind to seeing whether the evidence of the refusal can be presented in a more straightforward way which does not include the accused's reasons. 7. Accordingly in my opinion there is evidence that Mr El Mostafa refused to take part in the identification parade. Accordingly the visual identification evidence in the form of recognition evidence from witnesses at the scene is, in my opinion, admissible.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 2 March 2007 the offender was arraigned before me on an indictment alleging that he murdered a child aged seven months. He pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter and the Crown accepted this plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. It was accepted by the parties that the basis of the manslaughter was an unlawful and dangerous act committed by the offender when he shook the child causing fatal injuries. The injuries were inflicted on 5 July 2005 and the child died the next day in hospital. The offender is now to be sentenced for that offence which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. 
     
      
    2 A statement of facts was tendered as the basis upon which I am to sentence the offender. I was not given any other statements or material from the Crown brief. The facts can be summarised as follows. In October 2004 the offender became involved in a relationship with Ms Simon, the child's mother, who at that time was pregnant to another man. On 17 November 2004 Ms Simon gave birth to the child, the victim in this matter. 
     
      
    3 On 14 November 2004 the offender was taken into custody for an offence of dishonesty. He remained in custody serving a sentence until 13 June 2005. During his period of incarceration the relationship with Ms Simon continued by letters, telephone calls and occasional visits by her to the gaol. Throughout these communications the offender referred to the child as his son and made enquiries about his health and welfare. 
     
      
    4 Shortly before the offender's release, Ms Simon went to live at Taree with the child. On his release the offender joined them. The couple slept with the child on a mattress on the floor in the lounge room of the premises. At the time the offender was smoking cannabis and recommenced using heroin despite telling Ms Simon that he would not do so. 
     
      
    5 A week before the child's death the offender was playing with him in a rough fashion. Ms Simon remonstrated with him warning against shaking the child or roughly handling him as it could cause brain damage or death. The couple argued about the offender's handling of the child. 
     
      
    6 On 4 July 2005 Ms Simon left the child in the care of the offender at the home of the offender's uncle while she went to do some shopping. When she returned the child was asleep but Ms Simon disturbed him and he woke and began crying. Ms Simon and the offender argued, the offender blaming her for disturbing the child. They then returned to where they were staying. There the offender smoked cannabis and Ms Simon fed the child. Eventually the offender, Ms Simon, and the child fell asleep on a mattress on the lounge room floor. During the night the child stirred several times, crying on each occasion. Each time Ms Simon got up and comforted the child back to sleep. 
     
      
    7 At about 4:30 a.m. the child began to cry, waking both Ms Simon and the offender. Ms Simon tried unsuccessfully to settle the child. The offender became irritated and told Ms Simon that he was tired and she should stop the baby crying. The offender went to the bathroom. When he returned, the child was still crying and the offender began to argue with Ms Simon. She prepared a bottle of baby formula and fed the child. She then lay with him on the lounge holding him to her chest in an attempt to settle him but without success. The offender became more agitated repeatedly telling Ms Simon that she should quieten the baby. Eventually he offered to get the baby to sleep and lay down with him on the mattress on the floor. 
     
      
    8 Ms Simon fell asleep. However something caused her to wake and she saw the offender shaking the child. He was kneeling on the floor and holding him under the armpits with the child’s back toward him. Ms Simon saw the child's head was moving rapidly back and forth. She called out to the offender to stop, saying that he was going to kill the child. The offender said that he knew what he was doing and continued to shake the child for about thirty seconds. He then dropped him onto the mattress. 
     
      
    9 The child was lying on his right side and Ms Simon thought that he would not be able to breathe. She asked the offender to blow into his mouth. He told her to go across the road to a neighbour's house and call an ambulance. This she did and when she returned the offender was giving the child mouth-to-mouth. The neighbour came with Ms Simon and contacted Triple 0. She relayed questions from the operator to the offender asking what had happened before the baby stopped breathing. The offender said, ""I'd been playing with the baby. I put him down on the mattress and all of a sudden he stopped breathing"". The offender made a similar statement to an ambulance officer who arrived at the home a short time later. 
     
      
    10 Despite efforts to resuscitate the child, he died the next day. Post mortem examination of the child showed that he had suffered massive brain swelling consistent with what is commonly referred to as a shake/impact injury. The child suffered fractures to a number of ribs and a fracture of the distal left femur. All of the injuries suffered by the child were consistent with the offender's conduct as described by Ms Simon. There is no suggestion that the child had injuries from any other assault upon him. The child had generally been in good health and it is possible that he was teething at the time causing him to be unsettled and crying. 
     
      
    11 The offender was arrested on 5 July 2005 and charged with assault. Following the death of the child he was charged with murder on 18 July 2005. He has been in custody since his arrest. 
     
      
    12 The statement of facts tendered contained the following paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Crown concedes that, although there is some evidence that the offender had been warned prior to the assault of the possible consequences of shaking a baby, and was warned again by Ms Simon as he shook the deceased, the offender may not have been fully cognisant of the import of these warnings, and did not turn his mind to them when shaking the deceased. 
         
        
       
      This paragraph was placed in the statement of facts to indicate that the Crown had accepted a plea to manslaughter because it was not relying upon reckless indifference to human life as a basis for a charge of murder. 
       
      
    13 The offender was born on 9 July 1985. He has a criminal record dating from November 2003 when he was convicted in the Local Court of assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest and goods in custody. In May 2004 he was dealt with for each of those offences by the imposition of a two-year good behaviour bond with a condition that he enter into the Youth Drug Court Program. On 8 June 2005 he was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for offences of break enter and steal. He was released to parole from that sentence in June 2005 on conditions that he seek treatment for his drug addiction. He was on parole at the time he committed the current offence. 
     
      
    14 There were three psychological reports tendered on his behalf. The first was prepared by Ms Anderson, clinical psychologist, on the 11 May 2005 in relation to the offender being sentenced for break enter and steal offences. It sets out the background of the offender. He is a young man of Aboriginal race and the second of three brothers. His mother died when the offender was about five years of age and the three brothers then went to live with an uncle and aunt. They stayed there for about five or six years and during that time the offender came to know his father. However the father died when the offender was aged seven. When he was aged 11, the offender was sent to live with relatives in Townsville but he was unhappy there because he was separated from his brothers. Eventually he returned to this State and went to live with a great aunt who had the care of his older brother. This aunt gave evidence before me and I shall refer to her testimony later. 
     
      
    15 The offender had a disturbed schooling and eventually left in year 10. He has since leaving school been involved in various training courses in Taree. He was at one stage in a relationship with a young woman and they had a son who was at the time of the preparation of the report aged six months. The psychologist described the offender as performing in the low average to average range of intelligence. He demonstrated a good grasp of vocabulary and sound basic numeracy skills. He had become involved with drugs and at the time of the report was on a buprenorphine programme. 
     
      
    16 The second report was from Mr Champion and was prepared for the sentencing proceedings before me. He found the offender to be ""quite an articulate man, able to express himself with confidence and at times with a better than average vocabulary"". In respect to the killing of the child the report contains the following paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The offender] indicated that he had been released from prison some three weeks prior to the alleged incident which saw him charged. He indicated that when released he had been receiving buprenorphine, but that for some reason he could not access his medication in Taree, and as a result had periodically accessed buprenorphine and methadone illicitly, to try to cope with withdrawal symptoms. He indicated that he had also been abusing cannabis during this period, for instance indicating that he had used a ""stick"" that is about 15 cones on 4.7.05, though previous use may have been higher than this, there having been on his account a long-term history of heavy cannabis abuse. I note that [the offender] denied taking Endep (antidepressant). 
         
         
        In relation to the night of 4.7.05-5.7.05, as indicated [the offender] indicated that he had used a stick of cannabis on 4.7.05. He indicated that he was ""hanging out"" and suffering withdrawal symptoms as he had no money to access buprenorphine or methadone; and as a result had had perhaps 10-20 minutes sleep during the night, having spent the night playing with the computer and listening to music. He spoke of having experienced a headache with a focus behind the eyes, he reported a history of such headaches……… 
         
        
       
      
    17 No doubt because of comments made by Mr Champion in his report about possible neurological abnormalities, the offender was referred to a neuropsychologist, Dr Pulman. Her report contains a background of the offender consistent with that given in the earlier reports. The offender denied any difficulties with alcohol but reported smoking cannabis from the age of 11 and using that substance up until his incarceration for this offence. He used heroin from the age of 16 and at the age of 19 was injecting it twice a day. He has also used cocaine. He attended drug and alcohol programs both at Nowra and in Cessnock but returned to using drugs on each occasion. He has been prescribed an antidepressant that he has been using for about 12 months. Testing of the offender indicated that his overall intellectual functioning fell within the Average range and he had intact intellectual and cognitive abilities. Personality assessment tests indicated that he had symptoms of Major Depressive disorder, anxiety and drug dependence. 
     
      
    18 Of course all manslaughter offences are serious involving as they do the loss of a human life but it is particularly so with a very young child. Here the act causing the death of the deceased child was deliberate and, although there was no intention to injure the child, the act was one objectively very likely to cause serious injury to such a young child. It was an isolated incident of anger against the child over a very short period of time and as a result of his frustration with the child’s frequent crying. I believe that some of the applicant's irritation, which resulted in arguments with Ms Simon about the child in the days leading up to his death, were due to the applicant's use of drugs in order to cope with withdrawal symptoms. I note, to his credit, the offender tried to revive the child after the offender came to his senses. 
     
      
    19 General deterrence is an important consideration in sentencing for such matters even though they often occur on the spur of the moment and in stressful situations where the person is not always conscious of the results of their actions or the force being used. But the Court must denounce any violent act to a young child and send out the message that it is a serious criminal act that will result in a heavy sentence if the child is seriously injured let alone killed. 
     
      
    20 The offence is aggravated by the fact that the offender was in a position of trust to the child, acting very much as his father and treated as such by Ms Simon. The child was very young and particularly vulnerable. The offender was on parole. That however is not a very significant aggravating factor in this particular case because it did not relate to an offence of violence and the act was a reactive one to a situation of stress. But it was a condition of his parole that he continued treatment for his drug abuse. His use of cannabis and other illegally obtained drugs was in breach of his parole. However, the Crown accepted that his inappropriate behaviour with the child was to a substantial degree a reflection of his lack of experience with a child of that tender age and the offender’s immaturity. The charge itself accepts that the offender did not foresee the prospect of death or intend to cause serious injury to the child. I also accept that he did not have an awareness of the serious injury that he could cause the child by shaking him. However, contrary to submissions made on his behalf, I do not believe that s 21A(3)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act has any application to the sentencing of the offender.  
     
      
    21 He has had an unfortunate and unstable background because of the death of his parents and his separation from his brothers for a period. However he was fortunate to have his aunt to support him. As I have noted she gave evidence before me. The offender came to live with her when he was aged 13 or 14. He stayed with her for about two years. However he drifted into an Aboriginal settlement near Taree where there were many young males who abused alcohol and drugs. In was probably inevitable that the offender would end up with a significant drug problem that has brought him into trouble with the law. The aunt supports him with money while he is in custody. She is keen to assist him when he is released. 
     
      
    22 I am told that the offender is on protection but I know nothing about why he is there or the actual conditions upon which he is being held. I have no information as to whether his sentence will be harsher by reason of his custodial situation. 
     
      
    23 There is little doubt about his contrition and remorse over the death of the child. But there must be doubts about his prospects for rehabilitation so far as his use of illegal drugs is concerned when he continued using them after his release on parole and notwithstanding promises that he had made to Ms Simon. However, he is still a young man of average intelligence and unfortunately he was only released from prison three weeks before he was rearrested. Therefore, he had no real opportunity to obtain support from the parole service. This indicates that I should find special circumstances to give him a further chance to address his drug problem. 
     
      
    24 There is a victim impact statement before me as to the effect upon the mother of the loss of her child. I cannot increase the sentence to be imposed upon the offender by reason of the dreadful tragedy and suffering that he has caused his former partner. To an extent she feels responsible because of what she sees as her misplaced trust in the offender. His breach of her trust is a matter I can and will take into account. Otherwise I can only indicate that the Court understands her suffering and it is one of the reasons why manslaughter is generally considered a serious offence because it involves the loss of life normally of persons who are loved by one or more members of the community. But it is as much a crime against the general community as it is against her and that is why the Court must impose stern punishment against the offender notwithstanding his youth and sad background. 
     
      
    25 The offender should receive a discount of 20 per cent for his plea. It was on offer immediately after his committal to this Court but rejected by the Crown until shortly before the offender was arraigned before me. A question arises as to the commencement date of the sentence I impose upon him because he is presently serving the balance of parole. In Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145 it was held that a sentencing court has a discretion as to when to commence a sentence where the offender is serving the balance of parole. His parole was revoked by reason of the commission of this offence but as I have indicated he was using drugs in breach of his parole. The Crown submitted that I should not backdate the sentence so far as to impact upon a sentence of 9 months that he received for an offence committed while in custody. That sentence was dated from 19 May 2006 although the offender re-entered custody on 15 July 2005. Notwithstanding the Crown’s submission, I intend to backdate this sentence to 15 October 2006 to reflect the principle of totality. It will also be relevant to a finding of special circumstances that the offender will have been in continuous custody since 15 July 2005. 
     
      
    26 I have been referred to a number of cases on manslaughter of young children even though it has been noted that it is difficult to find an appropriate range because the offence is relatively rare: R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184. Despite being referred to statistical information I do not find it of any great assistance even as a guide. However, I have been referred to a number of sentences imposed in this Court for offences of a similar type although of course they each represent a discretionary judgment based upon the particular facts of each matter. Many, if not all of them were reviewed by O’Keefe J in R v Monroe [2003] NSWSC 1271; 148 A Crim R 478. They do indicate a general guide as to what might be an appropriate sentence and it is important for there to be a consistent approach as far as factual differences will allow. I note most of the persons sentenced for this type of offence have been on protection. 
     
      
    27 The offender is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months and a balance of term of 3 years. The non-parole period is to date from 15 October 2006 and expire on 14 July 2010 the date upon which the offender is eligible to be released to parole. The balance of term commences on 15 July 2010 and expires on 14 July 2013. The effect of this sentence is that the offender will have spent 5 years in gaol before he can be released to parole.

    JUDGMENT1. This is a judgment on a separate trial application made by the accused Saleh Khodr. Dr Webb, who appears for the accused Saleh Khodr, has made an application for a separate trial of his client. I will return to the evidence and submissions which he puts forward to support his application. 2. I turn first to a brief description of the Crown case. Both accused are charged with an offence I will shortly call riot with an alternative of affray. In addition both accused face three more charges, two of those charges are assault occasioning actually bodily harm. Each offence is alleged to involve a separate individual, and the third charge jointly faced by both accused is an offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm in respect of a third individual. 3. The circumstances of the allegations arise from events which occurred on 30 January 2005. Very briefly the Crown case is that on the late evening of that day there was a riot in the streets of Auburn. The riot on the Crown case was brought about by a group of people attacking another group of people. There will be evidence in the Crown case that the attacking group belonged to a sect of the Islamic faith known as Sunnis and that the attacked group belonged to another sect known as Shi'ites. The Crown case is that both accused were involved in the riot and the assaults occurred during the course of the riot.4. The Crown Prosecutor pointed out to me that so far as the applicant Mr Khodr is concerned, the Crown case is that he was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with his co-accused Amir El Mostafa and the other people who took part in the event. Mr Khodr was not, on the Crown case, an incidental passer-by. There is in the Crown case no separate evidence regarding any background motive on the part of Mr Khodr which may stem from his political or religious leanings. 5. I should add at this point by way of background that the context, on the Crown case, of the events is some tension between those two sects of the Islamic faith and two aspects of that tension are religious division and political division. 6. Returning to the Crown case against Mr Khodr the Crown Prosecutor pointed out that there was no particular background motive alleged against Mr Khodr, but an allegation that he partook in the activity and pointed out a particular individual, Mr Al Shemmari, with words along the lines of ""He's the one"" and after that Mr Al Shemmari was assaulted. 7. Mr Al Shemmari is the only witness in the Crown case who identifies Mr Khodr. There will be evidence that Mr Al Shemmari knew Mr Khodr by sight before these events and that he indicated to the police after these events, by reference to a photograph, the identity of this accused. That is the only form of identification evidence against this accused. 8. The Crown case is that the accused Amir El Mostafa was the organiser or central person involved in these events but that there was a joint criminal enterprise between the two accused and the other aggressors in the events. There will be no evidence against Mr Khodr that he was a leader or instigator, but as I said, the evidence against Mr Khodr is that his particular role is significant in that he pointed out Mr Al Shemmari as a victim of an assault. 9. I should add here that the identification evidence so far as the co-accused Mr El Mostafa is concerned is sourced to six individuals who saw him at the scene and who selected him by way of a photograph indicated to the police. 10. There was tendered on the application VDEM 27 which was evidence concerning a demonstration which occurred on the day that Iraqis living in Australia were voting in an election held in Iraq, and that evidence briefly points to the co-accused Mr El Mostafa or at least a photograph which appears to depict the co-accused Mr El Mostafa, demonstrating against those elections. There is other evidence concerning that day as well. 11. There was also tendered Mr Khodr's record of interview in which he claimed that he was innocently drawn into the events of that day. There was also tendered evidence that has been referred to in these interlocutory proceedings as a pre-riot fracas, that is a fight which occurred between the accused Amir El Mostafa and two young men earlier on the day of the events. The statement contains an allegation that Mr El Mostafa said to these two young men who were Shi'ites (and I add here that Mr El Mostafa and Mr Khodr are Sunni Muslims) words to the effect of:  
     
      
       
        “You're sons of dogs, sons of bitches, we don't accept you. You are not voting for yourself, you are voting for the USA. If you vote you will die.”  
       
      
     In addition it is alleged that he said:  
     
      
       
        “If you kill a Shiah you will go to heaven.""  
       
      
     
     
      
      There was an altercation after which it is alleged that Mr El Mostafa left the scene saying:  
       
       “I will show all you Shiah, you will see, I will be back tonight.""  
       
      
    12. It is part of the Crown case that this pre-riot fracas indicated a motive for Mr El Mostafa to return and participate in the riot, namely some form of revenge for the events which occurred during the fracas. It is also alleged by the Crown that another motive concerned Mr El Mostafa's expressed political and religious differences with the Shi'ite sect. In addition there were tendered evidence of transcriptions of telephone calls which were recorded and which involved Mr El Mostafa. 13. Dr Webb, on behalf of his client, indicated that his client's defence was essentially one of innocent association and that the case he faced was essentially an identification case which was based upon identification evidence to be called from Mr Al Shemmari. He contrasted that with the case against Mr El Mostafa where there were six identifying witnesses. 14. He argued that the two significant pieces of evidence which will be prejudicial to his client in a joint trial were evidence of the pre-riot fracas and evidence of the polling booth demonstration. He also referred, although not in detail, evidence of the telephone calls and to evidence of the fact that the co-accused El Mostafa was older than his client. 15. By reference to the principles according to which separate trial applications are to be determined Dr Webb argued that his client faced the danger of unfair prejudice. The principles, as he said and I accept, were set out by Hunt J (as his Honour then was) in Regina v Middis, unreported NSWSC 27 March 1991 and approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Baartman, unreported NSWCCA 6 October 1994. It was also referred to with approval but with some additional comment in Regina v Ngoc Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190. 16. Dr Webb referred to the polling booth evidence with its political flavour and the pre-riot fracas with its flavour of introductory violence that day which were the main pieces of evidence which he said were prejudicial to his client. In addition he argued that at least one of the sections under which his client was charged, namely s 93B of the Crimes Act 1900 speaks of a common purpose whereas the charge in respect of affray, the alternative to riot, which is the subject of s 93C, does not speak of common purpose. 17. Of course Dr Webb was right in that s 93B provides in part that where twelve or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose, an offence may result. The issue of common purpose and prejudice, pertaining to that aspect of the argument of Dr Webb, is of particular relevance to the lead charge namely riot, and particularly to the extent or otherwise to which the material would otherwise be not admissible against his client. His submission is that the jury may enlarge or enhance the common purpose as a form of unfair prejudice constituting a positive injustice, a positive injustice being a requirement of the principles for the consideration of separate trial applications. 18. Dr Webb emphasised that it is common ground that the only evidence against his client springs from evidence of the events of the alleged riot rather than any evidence which preceded those events. The evidence of what Mr Khodr thought, planned, did or did not do is referable only to what Dr Webb called the res gestae. He pointed to at least two aspects of positive injustice. The first injustice is by an unfair prejudice that the material before the jury on a joint basis would run a real risk of strengthening the identification made by Mr Al Shemmari on the basis that they were run together. The second positive injustice was that one may flow through to another, that is the charges in the common purpose or the content of that prejudice could quite naturally, in the mind of the jury, flow from one charge to another. In addition he argued that there would be, despite any directions that I give, a risk that the jury would use the evidence notwithstanding such strong directions, particularly in the context of the common purpose case which the Crown must present. 19. When I asked whether in a trial against his client alone the Crown would be entitled to bring evidence not of the pre-riot fracas nor of the polling booth demonstration but contextual evidence regarding the background to the riot, Dr Webb agreed that his client would have to face such general evidence concerning the background and circumstances of the alleged riot. 20. As I said the principles have been restated in Pham's case. The basis for a joint trial being appropriate was set out in the judgment of Toohey J with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed in Webb and Hay v The Queen (1993) 181 CLR 41 at 88 to 89. There His Honour said:  
     
      “ 
     I respectfully agree with that discussion which emphasises that when accused are charged with committing a crime jointly, prima facie there should be a joint trial. There are administrative factors pointing in that direction but, more importantly, consideration by the same jury at the same trial is likely to avoid inconsistent verdicts, particularly when each accused tries to cast the blame on the other or others. There are, of course, dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of the evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by expressing careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence so far as it concerns each accused 
     .” 
     I make two observations about that. The first is that I have omitted the references to authority, the second is that in this case the Crown Prosecutor argued that there were good reasons for a joint trial in this case, namely a lot of witnesses so far as their convenience was concerned and the importance of avoiding inconsistent verdicts. 21. In Pham, Adams J referred to the passage in the judgment of McHugh J in Gilbert v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414 at 425 where his Honour said:  
     
      “ 
     The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint word of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. 
     "" 
     His Honour said at the same page:  
     
      “ 
     Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials. 
     ” 
    22. This is a case in which both accused are alleged to be involved in a common purpose in committing various offences. As it happens the identification evidence in respect of one accused comes from one witness who had some familiarity with that accused, who is the applicant for this separate trial. The identification evidence in respect of the other accused comes from six witnesses.There is against the co-accused additional evidence by way of background to his motivation, namely political and religious considerations. 23. A preliminary question is whether the evidence of the political and religious motivations and the pre-riot violence (arguably now admissible if I ruled against the co-accused) would be highly prejudicial to the applicant, Mr Khodr. This must be seen as Adams J said in the context that there would be from me clear and emphatic directions given to the jury about inadmissible material being ignored so far as Mr Khodr is concerned. As the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, once the material about the pre-riot fracas and the polling booth demonstration is admitted against Mr El Mostafa it must be accompanied at the time by a clear direction from me that it is not admissible against the applicant, Mr Khodr. In addition I will give strong and clear directions during the course of my summing-up about the admissibility of that evidence in respect of one accused but not Mr Khodr. As the authorities say, the justice system acts upon the assumption that juries will adhere to and follow those instructions. 24. There is a sense in which this evidence, incriminatory of the co-accused Mr El Mostafa, as a matter of common sense does not involve Mr Khodr. There is no suggestion or evidence in his record of interview that he was present at either event. He said merely that he knew of the elections. He may have made reference to the demonstration but there is no suggestion that Mr Khodr himself was involved either in any election demonstration nor was he involved in the pre-riot fracas. It is, as I say, obvious from the content of the evidence itself that it does not incriminate Mr Khodr. 25. In my opinion the combination of that obvious aspect of the evidence together with clear directions from me will mean that any prejudice against Mr Khodr will be significantly reduced. In my opinion the desirability of this being a joint trial is high for the reasons set out by the High Court in Webb and Hay. 26. In my opinion there is no risk of the positive injustices suggested by Dr Webb, given the nature of the evidence against the co-accused and the directions which I will give both at the time that that evidence is admitted and during my summing-up. Accordingly the application is rejected.

    Sentence1 On 28 March, Lisa Bettie was found, on the limited evidence available to the Court, to have committed an offence of maliciously wounding Aminah Hamdoun with intent to do her grievous bodily harm. That verdict was given after a Special Hearing conducted before a judge sitting without a jury.2 Section 23(1)(a) Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 requires the Court to indicate, had the Special Hearing been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence, whether it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment.3 Neither the crown nor the defence counsel suggested anything other than a prison sentence would have been imposed in the circumstances of this case. That situation can be evaluated once the facts are reviewed.4 The facts as I found them to be are to be found in paragraphs 32 to 53 of my reasons for verdict of 28 March last. Significantly, and taking from those facts, I found the following: that Aminah Hamdoun was at the Bankstown Centro with her family about midday on 21 January 2006. The male members of the family had separated and the complainant and her mother had made their way to Hollywood Shoes. That shop occupied a corner position in the mall. Across a large exit corridor was a Supre clothing shop. Situated in the middle of the corridor was Boost Juice. 5 Mother and daughter were separated, the daughter to buy something from Boost Juice, the mother to shop at the Hollywood Shoes. The victim was paying for her purchase when she noticed the trainee shop assistant looking past her. She turned around to see what the trainee shop assistant was looking at. Behind her, with a knife slightly raised above her head, ready to plunge it into the complainant, was the accused. 6 I am satisfied the accused did not anticipate the complainant would see her or turn to face her. I am satisfied in doing so the complainant prevented the accused from stabbing her at that moment. The accused's act though is significant because it indicates an intent that was entertained by her at that time.7 Other evidence that I accepted established that, moments before the complainant turned, the accused had entered Bankstown Centro from the Appin Way through the JB Hi-Fi entrance. It was that entrance that flowed to the corridor leading to Boost Juice. I am satisfied the complainant was the first person the accused spotted wearing Muslim apparel who was standing still and was unaware of her intentions. I am satisfied at that time that it was the accused’s intention to target a Muslin with a view to stabbing that person. Her motive for so doing was that she felt she had had enough of Muslims. She told police she was related to a Muslim and she hated them. I am satisfied that at about that time she was “having problems”, at least in her mind, with Muslims, and had formed an antisocial attitude towards them. 8 I am satisfied that the knife that she was holding at the Bankstown Centro was a knife that she had brought into the Bankstown Centro with a view to stabbing, somebody. The knife had a ten centimetre blade. I am satisfied that she was both angry and determined; not angry specifically at the victim, but angry at Muslims in general.9 When the accused was first seen by her, the victim ran or walked towards where her mother was in the Hollywood Shoe shop. That was a distance of five to six metres. The accused followed her, still armed with the knife. The victim said, “What’s wrong? Are you okay?” After a moment’s hesitation, the accused thrust the knife that she was carrying towards the complainant’s upper body.10 The victim had her arm up, facing outwards, fingers extended like a policeman on point duty halting motor traffic. Hers was a reflex defensive response. The accused was thrusting the knife towards her. In doing that, she injured the complainant’s middle finger from the fingernail cuticle to the first joint with a laceration, the base of the middle finger with a smaller laceration, and the base of the index finger with a small cut. That cut may well have been caused by the complainant’s hand gripping and perhaps pushing the blade away. None of those injuries in that strike were serious.11 A further downward stabbing motion followed. The complainant raised her left hand. In that hand she was holding a shopping bag and her own handbag. Again, the action was a reflex defensive action. The knife came down, penetrating the upper surface of the left forearm, some five or six inches above the wrist, and emerged on the inside surface of the forearm again, also some five or six inches from the wrist. It would appear that the knife went through the wrist by, if I can put it crudely, the shortest direction.12 That area of penetrating wound has now healed. There is scarring at the opening and surgical scarring from that opening to the underside of the arm at the exit point. The knife, as it travelled through the arm, severed muscle and tendons. The area severed was the abductor policis longus, which controls actions of the thumb and is one of the tendons related to extending and abducting the wrist.13 I am satisfied that particular injury was not intended. It is a serious injury. I said that the injury inflicted was not intended, but I am satisfied that a more serious injury was intended. I am satisfied that it was the intent of the accused, when she plunged the knife the second time, to strike and penetrate the upper body of the victim.14 For the purposes of assessing the accused’s intent, it is also important to remember firstly that she had a knife; secondly that it was raised when the victim was at the Boost Juice; that she pursued the victim to a point nearer to Hollywood Shoes; that the knife was again raised towards the front of the complainant; when that blow was stopped, the knife was raised a third time. That is the injury that penetrated just above the victim’s wrist.15 The area of the complainant exposed whilst she was at Boost Juice were her shoulders, the nape of her neck, her upper back, an area that houses the heart, lungs and several vital arteries.16 After her arrest, the accused was interviewed by police. From my point of view, what is significant is what happened when the police left the interview room looking for the officer in charge of the station to attend upon the accused with a view to asking her the usual post-interview questions.  17 In that time span, the complainant conducted an emotional conversation with her support person. She said, “I can’t believe James would tell me to do something like this, to stab a beautiful woman.” 18 Subsequently speaking to, I think it was Dr Wilcox, the accused referred to Jane and gave to her the role of making the request for the stabbing. 19 The significance of the admission, that is, that she was asked to and responded to a request to stab, is that it displays a clear intent so to do. 20 That recitation of the facts explains why neither counsel really contested the proposition that in a normal trial, a finding of guilt on those facts would require an offender to be sentenced to imprisonment. I formally indicate that this Court would have imposed a term of imprisonment in such circumstances. 21 It now falls to the Court to nominate what is called a “limiting term”, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have imposed if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings and the evidence before the Court sustaining the conviction was the evidence of before the Court sustaining the commission of the offence (limited though it was).Do the Standard Non Parole provisions in part upon Sentence.22 It is significant to understand that the limiting term that is being imposed is the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have imposed if the Special Hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence and found guilty of the offence - see section 23(1)(b) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990.23 While the proceedings are to be conducted as near as possible to a normal criminal trial, when setting the limiting term the Court does not apply section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, but instead confines itself to the requirements of section 23, particularly 23 subsections (5) and (6) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990.24 All of this becomes important when it comes time for the Court to have regard to what impact, if any, section 54A - standard non-parole period - will have upon the limiting term, a topic to which I must return later.Objective seriousness. 25 This is a vicious attack from the victim’s point of view, gratuitously made, intended to occur at a time that the victim was unaware of the presence of her would-be attacker. The intended areas of attack were the upper torso, initially from behind and then on two subsequent occasions towards the victim’s shoulder and bodice area. The attack was done with a knife having a ten centimetre blade, that is, a knife capable of inflicting a lethal injury. The knife was wielded with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 26 There was a sufficient level of planning for the accused to have come to the shopping centre armed with a knife. In other words, this offence was not opportunistic or impulsive. Having said that, however, the level of planning was hardly sophisticated. It would appear to have been no more than the grabbing of a knife and going to the shopping centre with a view to finding a Muslim.The impact of the Standard Non Parole Provisions.27 After a criminal trial, an offence against section 33 of the Crimes Act is one attracting a standard non-parole period, provided the offence is judged to be one falling within a mid range of seriousness. 28 Mr Leary has sought to rely upon section 54 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It makes clear that Division 1A of Part 4 of that Act (standard non-parole period) does not apply to the sentencing of an offender to detention under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. What Division 1A does is, it creates a standard non-parole period that applies to mid range offences after trial. Way’scase [R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168] and others make clear that, although the standard non-parole period does not apply to offenders who plead guilty, its existence impacts upon the sentences to be imposed as a consequence of the Legislature’s creating a standard non-parole period.29 It seems to me that the way in which section 54D ought to be interpreted is that the standard non-parole periods prescribed for the various offences contained within the table in section 54D are not to be imposed upon those who are to receive a limiting term. I do not however read the section as saying that the existence of the standard non-parole period should not affect the approach to the limiting term.30 It seems to me the same logic must apply where a Court is setting its best estimate of the sentence it would have considered appropriate had a normal trial of criminal proceedings occurred for a person who is fit to be tried. That is to say, the effect of the existence of the standard non-parole period, even for the cases where it does not apply (guilty pleas and section 23 Mental Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act limiting terms) is still to drive upwards the sentence that would have otherwise been given had it not existed.Aggravating Factors.31 All other section 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act matters have been dealt with in my assessment of the objective criminality of this offence.Subjective Circumstances.32 I turn now to the subjective circumstances. I am both required and entitled to do that. The subjective circumstances of an offender may give some insight into the offending conduct and some reason why a more or less serious sentence should be imposed.Family dynamics and social background. 33 Lisa Beattie has had a limited guardianship order made in her favour. As a consequence of that order, she has had appointed the Public Guardian to maintain guardianship of her. The Guardian appointed has powers in relation to where Ms Beattie may reside, to determine what health care and major and minor medical and dental treatment she may receive, to make substitute decisions on her behalf about any medical or dental treatment proposed for her by others, to make decisions on her behalf concerning major services to which she should have access, to advocate generally on her behalf, and to make decisions with respect to her representation in the criminal justice system.34 Ms Beattie is a twenty year old woman who has been diagnosed with mild intellectual disability, borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia. The diagnosis is one that impacts upon her daily functioning, and touches particularly upon areas of her capacity to communicate, her lack of understanding and a general absence of social skills.35 She has a limited social network, very few peer relationships. Such friends as she did establish, assuming she did, at high school have not been maintained. She had not established any appropriate relationships in the wider community whilst residing at a special care facility. But she is engaged to a gentleman who I understand can be named as Gary, who she has known for approximately three years, and she requires, it is said, support to maintain the relationship. I note that he has been present at least on the last two occasions. Whether he was present earlier, I do not know, because my attention had not been drawn to him.36 She has a history of foster placements, the longest lasting ten years. That was reported to be positive, but it broke down in about 2001. Since 2001 she has had as many as ten placements, which would suggest a very unsettled life since 2001. Her placements have been both funded and unfunded. They include refugee centres and group homes. 37 The Centre, which was where she was living in 2002, is supported accommodation with twenty-four hour support staff. She was absent from that setting for a two week period, which found her placed on remand at Mulawa Women’s Correctional Facility. It is envisaged that the situation post this offence will be more closely supported and monitored than the last, as I understand it.Education, employment and skills. 38 Ms Beattie attended the Bankstown Public School in her primary years. In her secondary school years, she required intensive academic support, but sought to function in the mainstream system. Her high school teachers at Holy Spirit College, Lakemba and at Cabramatta High School identify her as having many difficulties in functioning in a school setting. Those difficulties would no doubt be related to her intellectual disability and her capacity to daily function.39 She attended a post-school options programme which was designed to assist her participate in activities that would help her develop skills, give her some social contact with other people, and gain a sense of being in a community. As events turned out, she sought to discontinue that programme, but has interest in attending a vocational training, and at some time in the future gaining employment. So far as I can tell on the material before me, there is no evidence of her having any particular skills in the employment area yet, or in having any employment history.Medical history. 40 Again so far as I can tell, it would appear that she is physically in reasonably good health. Her major problems appear to be related to her intellectual disability and to her mental health problems. She has, as I say, been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia of a disorganised type, poly-substance abuse and a psychotic disorder not otherwise specified.Dr Giuffrida, on an overview of reports, noted this: 
     
      
      “On reading Dr Brown’s report, she is firmly of the opinion that Ms Beattie suffers from schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. 
      
     
     
      
      Dr Wilcox, in her report of 14 January 2006, states that Ms Beattie has a definite vulnerability to develop psychosis, with experience of auditory hallucinations and persecutory ideation. In her report of 20 June 2004, she thought that the most likely diagnosis was of schizophrenia. Dr Wilcox’s differential diagnosis, although not stated as such, was that her psychosis was one precipitated by substance use.” 
      
    41 I have before me also the report of Dr Rosalie Wilcox of 20 June 2004. It was a report that appears to have been generated on the question of whether she was fit to be tried on certain charges, although not, I think, the charge currently before me.42 In giving the past psychiatric history, Dr Wilcox noted: 
     
      
      “Ms Beattie has had an extensive contact with various psychiatric services. When she was aged fifteen, she spent four weeks at Redbank Adolescent Unit because she was paranoid. She had several admissions to Bankstown Psychiatric Hospital, and the admissions related to her ongoing paranoia. She said that following her admissions she did not always take her medication and continued to use drugs. Since stopping her use of illicit drugs and taking regular medication, she says she has been feeling more stable. She was uncertain of her current medication. She said she had an injection every two weeks and was also required to take oral medication.” 
      
    43 As to the mental state examination in 2004, the situation was for Dr Wilcox: 
     
      
      “Ms Beattie presented as an adolescent female with a slight build, with blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail. She was dressed in prison attire. She gave the impression of being younger than her stated age. She had mild acne scars on her face and several cigarette burns on the back of her hand.  
      
     
     
      
      She had a restricted range of emotional response. Compared to when I assessed her late last year, she was a lot more settled; however, within less than an hour she became restless and requested to terminate the assessment.  
      
     
     
      
      Her thoughts were disordered and at times she did not make any sense. She was observed to lose concentration on several occasions, either due to dissociation or distraction by auditory hallucinations. She acknowledged the presence of auditory hallucinations that were primarily the voice of a woman whom she knew when she was younger, and the voice said unpleasant things to her and told her to harm herself. 
      
     
     
      
      She had difficulty maintaining attention and it was necessary to repeat a number of questions. She was oriented to time and place. Her manner of relating was indicative of mild developmental delay.” 
      
    44 I am satisfied the accused’s mental illness contributed to her commission of the offence. She remarked when she was at the police station that she had been told by James to do it. Later “James” became “Jane”. Whether that is a spelling mistake by someone transposing an “n” for an “m”, or a change of account by the accused, is unclear. Whether James or Jane actually exist is also unestablished. But given her mental condition, whatever is the case, the reception of such a request would have been more readily acted upon by her than if she had been in complete control of her mental facultiesAlcohol and drug abuse. 45 There is not much evidence before me as to the state of her consumption of alcohol and drugs at the time of this offence. What I am satisfied of is that she was, though, abusing to some extent drugs in the period around the time of this offence. The drugs that would appear to be her drugs of preference at that time are marijuana and what is commonly known as ICE.Attitude to offence. 46 It is likely the accused had very little insight into the significance of her attack upon Ms Hamdoun, or any understanding why such conduct is seriously criminal. Her absence of insight arises as a consequence of her intellectual capacity and her mental health situation. In the circumstances, there can be no aggravation of her criminality on account of her lack of insight, but it is nonetheless a factor to be considered when assessing her capacity to rehabilitate.Rehabilitation. 47 It is unlikely in the short to intermediate term this offender’s rehabilitation prospects could be assessed positively. She has serious mental health issues that appear to me to be not yet stabilised, whether by medication or by age or a settling in the condition. She has issues of intellectual capacity. She has drug abuse issues that are unresolved. Her family and social support networks can only be assessed as weak and of dubious quality. I am, though, conscious that the boyfriend, Gary, would appear to be a beacon of support in an otherwise impoverished situation.48 She is likely to be kept in a secure, hopefully structured and therapeutic environment for the foreseeable future.Deterrence. 49 Ms Beattie is not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence, nor, in my view, is she an appropriate vehicle for personal deterrence. It is unlikely, being unfit to be tried, she has any real idea of what is happening to her or why that is so. Her thinking is likely to be concrete, that is, limited to concepts such as that she is in custody or in a secure environment; that her so being there requires adherence to a regime which is dictated to her by others, and that somewhere in the future the regime may change. However, it is unlikely that she understands the factors that will cause it to change or the mechanism by which it does change. In those circumstances, it seems pointless to think that personal deterrence would have any impact upon her.Setting the sentence. 50 The injuries actually sustained were serious. True, they were not the intended injuries. The intended injuries would have been much more serious. The injuries sustained required medical attention. Once the bleeding had stopped, they were not life threatening. 51 The subjective features on behalf of the accused’s rehabilitation and factors that would feed into that are bleak. Her insight into the offending conduct is really non-existent. I cannot confidently assert that she would be unlikely to reoffend if she were not in a secure environment. 52 She has on her history other instances of offending, but not many of them, including a malicious injury to her intended partner. There are offences indicating significant lack of judgment, such as offensive language, behaving in an offensive manner, failing to pay a taxi fare perhaps, and there are some offences of dishonesty.53 It is not a record that would have disentitled her to leniency, but it is a record that reinforces the absence of rehabilitation prospects.54 The maximum penalty for this offence is one of twenty-five years imprisonment. The difficulty here then becomes that the sentence that I would have set would have been mitigated by the finding of special circumstances and the like. None of that material can I take into account in setting this sentence. The term of imprisonment I would have imposed to a person who had been fit to be tried and was in fact tried would have been one of five years imprisonment. That being so, that is the term that I must set as the limiting term.55 What now is required is to give credit for the time already served. The limited term will date from 21 January 2006, and will expire on 20 January 2011.56 Pursuant to section 24(1), I refer Lisa Beattie to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.57 I further order that Ms Beattie be kept at the Long Bay Prison Hospital until such time as a bed is available at the Bunya Unit at Cumberland Hospital, and thereafter be retained there until further order of the Court.58 The next order I make is that a copy of these remarks on setting the limiting term and the original decision by me, will both be sent to the Mental Health Review Tribunal and both of you will get a copy of each.59 I direct the Registrar to send copies of my reasons for finding, on the limited evidence, the commission of the offence, and these remarks on setting a limiting term, to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.60 I will give leave to the parties to apply to me in the event of non-action by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. So I am putting it back in your Court.LEARY: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: So, leave given to the parties to approach the Court for further order.

      Charge two: That he and Roy William Nicholson on 14 August 1986 at Parramatta did cause grievous bodily harm to Ronald Paul Gollan with intent to murder the said Ronald Paul Gollan (s 27 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900).  
       
      
    2 The jury had been given the opportunity to find the plaintiff guilty of the less serious alternative charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Ronald Paul Gollan (Gollan) with intent to do grievous bodily harm but declined to do so. The jury, as Justice Hunt observed in his remarks on sentence, were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the plaintiff’s intent to kill Gollan .  
     
      
    3 The plaintiff on the first charge which was described by the sentencing judge as one of aiding and abetting the assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed by Mitchell Winefield upon Gollan was sentenced to penal servitude for four years. He was sentenced on the second charge to penal servitude for 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years. The sentences were to be served concurrently and to date from 8 October 1987. 
     
      
    4 On 7 September 1995 the plaintiff was released on parole. The time served in custody for the sentences imposed was accordingly seven years and 11 months. 
     
      
    5 Thomas Ross Eastwood, then a detective in the New South Wales Police Force, gave evidence on 13 March 1996 to the Police Royal Commission (the Commission) which included the following (see exhibit D):  
     
      
       
        
       
       
        
        “Q. If document 1711747 might be brought up on the screen. I’m going to direct your attention now, sir, to the investigation of a man by the name of Bruce Malcolm Thomas. Do you recollect being involved in an inquiry concerning an allegation that Mr Thomas had assaulted a person? 
        
       
      
     A. Yes. 
     
      
       
        
        Q. What, briefly, were the circumstances surrounding that matter? 
         
        A. It happened at - him and a couple of other fellows bashed a fellow in gaol, a fellow named Gollan.  
        
       
      
     Q. A fellow named Gollan? A. Yeah. 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Were you and Detective Hannay the officers conducting inquiries into that matter? 
         
        A. Some of the – two of the officers were conducting inquiries in that matter. There was a number of police involved in that matter. Myself and Detective Hannay interviewed Bruce Thomas at the Parramatta police station.  
        
       
      
     Q. Did you verbal Mr Thomas? A. Yes. 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Was there any question of you receiving any payment in connection with your inquiries? 
        
       
      
     A. No. 
     
      
     Q. What was the reason that you verballed Mr Thomas? A. Well, to assist in convicting him for the assault.” 
     
      
    6 The plaintiff had been interviewed by Detective Senior Constable Christopher Hannay (Hannay) and Detective Senior Constable Eastwood (Eastwood) at Parramatta police station in the afternoon of 26 September 1986 in relation to the assault upon Gollan (‘the second interview’).7 Following the second interview, the plaintiff was taken to Granville police station and charged by Hannay with one count of ‘feloniously’ wounding Gollan with intent to murder contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of inflicting grievous bodily harm on Gollan contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act 1900. On the same afternoon Mitchell Winefield (Winefield) and Roy Nicholson (Nicholson) were each charged with one count contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count contrary to s 35 Crimes Act 1900 in similar terms to the plaintiff.  
     
      
    8 On 9 January 1987 the plaintiff, after a committal hearing in the Parramatta Local Court, was committed to stand trial on each count. It appears that the charge contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act 1900 was amended to read did “inflict grievous bodily harm upon” Gollan rather than “feloniously” did “wound” prior to the plaintiff being committed. Nicholson at the same hearing was also committed for trial on each count whereas Winefield was solely committed on the s 35 count, the Magistrate not being satisfied that the prosecution case in respect of Winefield was capable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt of the intent to murder. 
     
      
    9 Following the committal for trial the prosecution was taken over by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). It is unclear on what date that occurred, however, it was before the plaintiff’s trial. The plaintiff was indicted at the commencement of his trial in the Supreme Court with a fresh count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59 of the Crimes Act 1900 and an alternative count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. These charges were laid, it appears, by the DPP.  
     
      
       
      
    10 Hannay and Eastwood gave evidence at the plaintiff’s trial (and committal hearing) that the plaintiff had made admissions during the second interview which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “We went to my cell. Mitch shit himself about it. Me and Nico went back. The arse was coughing blood so we smashed his head. Fuck him, he’s better dead.” [Hannay] said “Did you intend to kill him?” He said “Yeah, he should be dead.” [Hannay] said “What happened when you were in the cell?” He said, “We picked him up, give it to him and threw him on the bed.” 
        
       
      
    11 By these representations attributed by the police officers to the plaintiff, the plaintiff admitted not only that he had participated in a savage attack upon Gollan but also that he had an intention to kill. 
     
      
    12 On 31 October 1997 the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal and on 13 April 1999 the plaintiff’s appeal was allowed, convictions quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered. 
     
      
    13 On the 25 October 1996 the plaintiff was sentenced in the District Court for an offence of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation to a term of imprisonment of twelve years with a minimum term of nine years. The offence was committed on 12 July 1996 whilst the plaintiff was on parole. The additional term of the sentence expires on 11 July 2008 and the plaintiff is presently in custody.  
     
      
    14 The plaintiff brings proceedings against the State of New South Wales for malicious prosecution. He claims general damages, aggravated and exemplary damages, compensation for deprivation of liberty and past and future economic loss. Hannay and Eastwood were members of the New South Wales Police Service at the time. The State is sued pursuant to s 5 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1988 and s 8 of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983. The claim is founded on the assertion that the police officers fabricated the admissions which they said were made by the plaintiff on 26 September 1986. The plaintiff claims that Hannay and Eastwood had no reasonable and probable cause to charge him and maliciously invented the admissions. The State has admitted vicarious liability for the actions of Hannay and Eastwood and the former police officers have not been joined by the plaintiff.  
     
      
    15 The elements of the tort of malicious prosecution in the present case are: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The institution of criminal proceedings against the plaintiff by the defendant;  
        
       
      
     (2) That the proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff. 
     
      
       
        
        (3) That the defendant, in initiating or maintaining the proceedings acted maliciously; and  
         
        (4) That the defendant acted without reasonable and probable cause.  
         
        
       
      
    16 The plaintiff has identified the real issues between the parties as being: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) whether there was an absence of reasonable and probable cause to institute the charges (or either of them) as at 26 September 1986; and  
        
       
       
        
        (b) whether or not Hannay and Eastwood “verballed” the plaintiff on 26 September 1986, thereby reinforcing the absence of reasonable and probable cause and justifying a finding of malice.  
         
        
       
      
    Element one: The institution of criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    17 The plaintiff was charged by Hannay at Granville Police Station on 26 September 1986. New charges were subsequently laid by the DPP. The State argues that its liability was curtailed as the case was taken over by the DPP two new charges were laid and the only charge laid by Hannay which came to be determined by the jury was charge two. In respect of that charge the State submits that s 9(4) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act applies and the Director is deemed to be the prosecutor from the time the Director takes the matter over.  
     
      
    18 Section 9(4) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 is as follows: 
     
      
       
       “(4) If the Director takes over a matter under this section: 
       
        
         
          
          (a) the Director shall, as from the time when the Director complies with section 10(1) in relation to the matter, be deemed to be the prosecutor in connection with the prosecution or proceeding concerned, and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the Director may decline to proceed further in the prosecution or to carry the proceeding further.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    19 It appears that the DPP became involved in the proceedings after 20 March 1987 (T576).  
     
      
    20 This submission raises the issue of who was the prosecutor who instituted the proceedings against the plaintiff. In Davis v Gell  (1924) 35 CLR 275 Isaacs ACJ, who was the only member of the High Court to refer to this issue, observed (at p 282) that “the law looks beyond theory and regards the person in fact instrumental in prosecuting the accused as the real prosecutor”. Isaacs ACJ went onto the explain (at p 283) that the answer to the question “who was the prosecutor?” is a question of fact and depends on all the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    21 In Commercial Union Assurance v Lamont [1989] 3 NZLR 187, a decision of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, Richard J remarked (at p 193) that a defendant to incur liability “must have played a sufficient role in the institution of proceedings as to be regarded as setting them in motion”. 
     
      
    22 O’Keefe J in Nye v State of New South Wales & Ors (2004) Aust Tort Reports [¶81 – 725] said (para 14): 
     
      
       
        
        “To incur liability as a prosecutor a defendant must have played an active role in the proceedings by setting them in motion or by adopting or continuing them………”  
        
       
      
    23 Hannay, it is clear, was active in the investigation of the assault upon Gollan and the laying of charges. He was a member of the police investigation team which was led by Detective Sergeant Snell (Snell). His participation included the inspection of the prison cell in which the assaults on Gollan took place, the interview of the plaintiff with Detective Hough (Hough) on 28 August 1986 (the first interview) and the second interview. On the night before the second interview Snell, Hannay, Eastwood and Detective Brown (Brown) discussed the appropriate charges that would be preferred against the plaintiff and were of the view that there was sufficient evidence to substantiate the charges which were laid the next day by Hannay. 
     
      
    24 The charging of the plaintiff by Hannay at Granville police station on 26 September 1986 with the counts contrary to ss 27 and 35 of the Crimes Act 1900 falls within the first element of the tort of malicious prosecution. Hannay was the prosecutor. It does not matter, in my view, so far as the issue of liability is concerned that the proceedings were subsequently taken over by the DPP and fresh charges were laid nor does it matter that Hannay was a member of an investigation team of which Snell was in charge. Hannay played a major role in the institution of the criminal proceedings by setting them in motion.  
     
      
    Element two: Favourable termination of proceedings  
     
      
    25 There is no dispute that the quashing of the convictions and entry of verdicts of acquittal by the Court of Criminal Appeal was a termination of the proceedings in the plaintiff’s favour, that is, that they have been brought to an end without adverse consequences to him: see Davis v Gell (above) and Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd v Smith (1937-1938) 59 CLR 527.  
     
      
    26 The real issue in the present proceedings is whether the plaintiff has established the third and fourth elements of the tort of malicious prosecution.  
     
      
      Element three: Malice  
       
      
    27 In “A”, it was said in the joint judgment [at 91]: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is clear is that, to constitute malice, the dominant purpose of the prosecutor must be a purpose  
        other 
         than the proper invocation of the criminal law – an “illegitimate or oblique motive”. That improper purpose must be the sole or dominant purpose actuating the prosecutor.” 
        
       
      
    28 And [at 93]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Two further observations should be made about the element of malice. First, its proof will often be a matter of inference. But it is proof that is required, not conjecture or suspicion. Secondly, the reference to “purposes other than a proper purpose” might be thought to bring into this realm of discourse principles applied in the law of defamation or in judicial review of administrative action. No doubt some parallels could be drawn with the principles applied in those areas. But drawing those parallels should not be permitted to obscure the distinctive character of the element of malice in this tort. It is an element that focuses upon the dominant purpose of the prosecutor and requires the identification of a purpose other than the proper invocation of the criminal law.”  
        
       
       
      Element four: Absence of reasonable and probable cause 
       
      
    29 A clear statement of what is required for the plaintiff to prove in an action for malicious prosecution in relation to element four is found in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Heydon and Brennan JJ in A v State of New South Wales [2007] HCA 10 at [76] and [77]: 
     
      
       
        
        “76. The absence of reasonable and probable cause will not in every case be shown by demonstrating that the prosecutor had no positive belief that the accused person was, or was probably, guilty. In particular, references to belief in guilt, or more properly, the absence of belief in guilt, will very likely prove distracting in any case where the prosecutor may not be supposed to know where the truth lies. A case where the prosecutor acts on the statements of others is one example of such a case. 
        
       
       
        
        77. These are three critical points. First, it is the negative proposition that must be established: more probable than not the defendant prosecutor acted  
        without  
        reasonable and probable cause. Secondly, that proposition may be established in either or both of two ways: the defendant prosecutor did not “honestly believe” the case that was instituted or maintained, or the defendant prosecutor had no sufficient basis for such an honest belief. The third point is that the critical question presented by this element of the tort is: what does the plaintiff demonstrate about what the defendant prosecutor made of the material that he or she had available when deciding whether to prosecute or maintain the prosecution? That is, when the plaintiff asserts that the defendant acted without reasonable and probable cause, what exactly is the content of that assertion?” 
        
       
      
    30 The absence of reasonable and probable cause is to be determined on the material the prosecutor had available when deciding whether to commence or maintain the prosecution, not whatever material may subsequently come to light: see “A” at [para 56]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even if a prosecutor is shown to have initiated or maintained a prosecution maliciously (for example, because of animus towards the person accused) and the prosecution fails, an action for malicious prosecution should not lie where the material before the prosecutor at the time of initiating or maintaining the charge both persuaded the prosecutor that laying a charge was proper, and would have been objectively assessed as warranting the laying of a charge”. 
        
       
      
    31 The fourth element of the tort of malicious prosecution involves both a subjective and objective aspect: See “A” at [38]. 
     
      
       
      The onus of proof 
       
      
    32 The onus of proving each of the elements of the tort lies with the plaintiff. The standard of proof is the civil standard, namely, the balance of probabilities. In applying this standard the nature and the seriousness of the allegation to be proved must be borne in mind. In Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336, Dixon J said (at 361 – 363): 
     
      
       
        
        “Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters “reasonable satisfaction” should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences………This does not mean that some standard of persuasion is fixed intermediate between the satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt required upon a criminal inquest and the reasonable satisfaction which in a civil issue may, not must, be based on a preponderance of probability. It means that the nature of the issue necessarily affects the process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained.” 
        
       
      
    33 An allegation of malicious prosecution is serious. In the present case the allegation is particularly serious being founded on the assertion that Hannay and Eastwood “verballed” the plaintiff and perjured themselves at committal and trial. The consequences flowing from adverse findings to Hannay are likely to be grave as he is a solicitor in practice in Queensland. Adverse findings may affect his ability to continue in his profession. Adverse findings are likely to be of no import to Eastwood who has suffered the consequences of his revelations to the Police Royal Commission. 
     
      
    34 The standard of proof required remains the civil standard. When applying Briginshaw v Briginshaw (above) it is necessary to remember what was said in Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings (1992) 67 ALJR 170. The High Court emphasised that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The ordinary standard of proof required of a party who bears the onus in civil litigation in this country is proof on the balance of probabilities. That remains so even where the matter to be proved involves criminal conduct or fraud. On the other hand, the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what is sought to prove. Thus, authoritative statements have often been made to the effect that clear or cogent or strict proof is necessary “where so serious a matter as fraud is to be found”. Statements to that effect should not, however, be understood as directed to the standard of proof. Rather, they should be understood as merely reflecting a conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a judicial approach that a court should not lightly make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct.” (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ at p 170 –171): See also  
        Rejfek v McElroy 
         (1965) 112 CLR 517. 
        
       
       
      Was the plaintiff “verballed”? 
       
      
    35 The first matter of fact this case raises is whether the admissions said to have been made to the plaintiff on 26 September 1986 were fabricated by Hannay and Eastwood. It is common ground that in the absence of such a finding neither the absence of reasonable and probable cause nor the presence of malice in relation to the institution of the proceedings could be established by the plaintiff. In determining this issue I have sought to avoid the advantages of hindsight and a jurist’s discomfort with interviewing procedures employed by police prior to the advent of the video camera.  
     
      
    36 The plaintiff gave evidence in the present proceedings that the first time he found out that he had said something about being involved in bashing Gollan was when he appeared at the committal hearing. He said when he was escorted into the interview room on 26 September 1986, Detective Hannay was there with a female police officer and another male police officer. Detective Hannay said to him they were going to interview him over the assault on Gollan. The plaintiff then said (T 40 L 9 – 31): 
     
      
       
        
        “I told him how I come back from the gym with 4 inmates and I went to my mate’s cell for lunch and I seen Mr Golan (sic) lying in a pool of blood………I went in and seen he was in a bad way, so I asked my mate, who I was with, to assist me. We lifted him onto the bed and he had a bit of a – what do you call it? He chucked a fit and blood flew out of his nose and mouth and splattered over the wall. I rolled him on his side and put him in what I call a recovery position. I put his head back so he could breath. It made no difference. He was tossing and turning. I said: “We better go and notify the – tell the prison officers and say he was in a bad way and he needed a doctor.” And that’s what I did, I went to the bottom landing of the wing and I told the prison officer that I found him on a pool of blood and he needed medical treatment, Mr Windchip I think was his name. He just continued reading the paper. I told him he was in a bad way and he needed a doctor. He said: “I will check into it.” I think he went up to the middle landing and l left the wing and spoke to a couple of people I knew for about 5 minutes and went back to me cell and spent the rest of the day playing cards with an inmate.” 
        
       
      
     And (at L 43 – 48): 
     
      
       
        
        “Yes, that’s what I told Mr Hannay in the interview. He said words like, you know: “You’re full of bullshit. Tell me a different story.” He mentioned $10,000 and I didn’t have no $10,000. I told him the truth. I wasn’t going to tell him a different story just to get someone else into trouble, that’s not my style……” 
        
       
       
      
    37 Counsel for the State subjected the plaintiff’s account of the interview to close scrutiny in cross-examination.  
     
      
    38 One of the matters identified by counsel for the State as being of significance was the lack of cross-examination at committal or trial of Hannay and Eastwood that the plaintiff had told them that Gollan ‘chucked a fit and blood flew out of his nose and mouth and splattered on the wall’ and the omission of that material from the unsworn dock statement made at trial. 
     
      
    39 The blood splatter in cell 210 ‘B’ in which Gollan was assaulted was a circumstance relied upon by the Crown to prove that the plaintiff with Nicholson rammed Gollan’s head against the cell wall. The staining of the cell wall assumed early significance in the investigation of the crime. Hough, went with Hannay to the cell on the same day as the assault and gave evidence in the present proceedings that he saw just above the pillow area of the bottom bunk blood splatter going up the wall to about 600 millimetres. It was spreading out in almost a ‘fan shape’ and went almost, to the next bunk, up the wall (T331). He discussed with Hannay that the impact of the head on the wall would need to be “very, very significant to cause that amount of blood to splatter up that far up the wall” (T332). Detective Sergeant Johnson (Johnson) of the scientific investigation section photographed the staining on the cell wall on the next day which in his statement he described as appearing to be similar to a “splash pattern”. The photocopies of photographs tendered in the present proceedings (exhibit 2) regrettably are of poor quality and were described by Hough as not representing the full extent of the blood splatter on the wall. 
     
      
    40 Hannay and Hough interviewed the plaintiff on the 28 August 1986 (the first interview). The running sheet (exhibit C volume 1 at 85) records that “Thomas was shown photographs of the blood splatter on the wall next to the pillow on the bottom bunk where he agreed he had placed his head and would not give any explanation as to how this blood got there.” The plaintiff agreed in cross-examination that during the interview he explained that he would not give the police any explanation as to how the blood splatter came to be on the wall (T 132).  
     
      
    41 Mr Peluso of counsel represented the plaintiff at trial. A perusal of the transcripts of the trial and committal does not reveal any questions being asked of Hannay or Eastwood of the plaintiff’s revelation to them of the expectoration of blood from Gollan’s nose and mouth onto the wall nor did the plaintiff make express reference to it in his dock statement.  
     
      
    42 Counsel for the plaintiff points, however, to the inclusion in the dock statement by the plaintiff that he lifted Gollan onto the bed gently, that “Mr Gollin (sic) was still having troubles, he was making gargling (sic) sounds”. The plaintiff had earlier referred to “choking sounds” coming from the person lying on the floor (see exhibit C volume 2 at 111). The plaintiff contends that the blood splatter is consistent with these statements.  
     
      
    43 It seems to me to be surprising that if the plaintiff had provided at the interview on 26 September 1986 an explanation of the blood splatter on the cell walls consistent with innocence that this matter was not put by his counsel to Hannay or Eastwood and was not expressly referred to by the plaintiff during his statement from the dock.  
     
      
    44 This is to be contrasted with the plaintiff’s description in evidence given on 1 June 1998 in proceedings by Gollan for personal injury damages, of Gollan starting to “fit and blood started spattering all over the walls from his nose and mouth………” (T 93 L 48-50). There were inconsistencies, in the plaintiff’s evidence given before this Court and in the Gollan civil proceedings. The plaintiff described himself as a hostile witness in Mr Gollan’s action and egregiously said he “could have said I believe in the man in the moon” (T 96 L 2 - 3). 
     
      
    45 The credibility of the plaintiff’s evidence of $10,000 being mentioned was subjected to attack by counsel for the State as it had not been referred to in his dock statement or cross-examination at the criminal trial. The plaintiff initially explained he did not tell Mr Peluso until after the criminal trial which was subsequently changed to his thinking he might have told him before the trial. He explained it was not referred to in the dock statement as he did not feel it was important at the time. The plaintiff said that Hannay threatened to bash him (at the first interview) and someone gave him a ‘bit of a clip’. He did not report it because it was a waste of time. Hannay, he agreed, was not challenged at the trial about his being bashed. 
     
      
    46 Snell, the plaintiff said, in the first interview said to Hannay “Let’s fit him up. We know he’s done it” (T 125). He agreed not one word along those lines emerged during the committal, trial or dock statement. In further cross-examination he conceded that Snell was not present at the first interview. A concession had been previously made that his earlier nomination of Eastwood as being present was incorrect. 
     
      
    47 Without dilating further on the cross-examination, it was evident that the plaintiff’s recollection of events was in a state of confusion. Inconsistencies and changes in position undermined his credibility. He was not an impressive witness. In making this assessment, I have made due allowance for the substantial lapse of time since the Gollan assault and state of his health. The plaintiff in particular described serious injuries sustained in 1991 and his current bad health.  
     
      
    48 I do not accept the plaintiff’s allegations in the present proceedings of police violence and corruption not raised during his criminal trial. The assertion that he, a regular inmate of the prison system, would be asked for a substantial sum of money as a bribe is plainly implausible. These allegations, in my view, were made to enhance the perception of police misconduct.  
     
      
    49 Although the plaintiff was an unimpressive witness he has constantly denied (save for the alleged admissions) involvement in the attack upon Gollan. During the first interview, he told police he saw Gollan lying on the cell floor with a large amount of congealed blood under his head. Gollan was gargling and urinating. With Nicholson’s assistance, he lifted Gollan from the floor and placed him on the bed facing out. He then informed a prison officer that Gollan needed assistance. The plaintiff’s denial was maintained throughout the committal and trial. He has consistently denied making admissions during the second interview. In the course of the dock statement he said that “he told Mr Hannay the truth from the very start but he wasn’t interested in that”. (Exhibit C volume 2 at 116).  
     
      
    50 Thomas Ross Eastwood is the fountainhead of the assertion that the oral admissions said to have been made by the plaintiff on 26 September 1986 were fabricated. It was his evidence which triggered the events leading to the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. His affirmative answer before the Commission to the question, “Did you verbal Mr Thomas?” could only be understood to mean that he was representing that he had falsified an oral confession by the plaintiff. The only interview of the plaintiff he had participated in was that conducted by Hannay at Parramatta police station on 26 September 1986. His credit is of significance in this case. Either Eastwood told lies at the plaintiff’s trial or to the Commission. 
     
      
    51 Copies of the relevant evidence are exhibits D and 10 in the present proceedings.  
     
      
    52 Eastwood presented as a diminished man. It appears he has been on witness protection for a number of years. He had no recollection of the interview conducted on 26 September 1986, nor of the evidence he gave to the Commission involving the plaintiff. In cross-examination he agreed that pressure had been exerted upon him by Royal Commission investigators to provide information and had formed the view if he did not co-operate he would almost certainly go to gaol. He was suffering from depression at the time and had attempted to commit suicide shortly prior to giving evidence on 8 March 1996. 
     
      
    53 Eastwood, however, was resolute as to the use of his duty book to jog his memory before the Commission. Counsel assisting the Commission would have gone, he said, to a particular page in the duty book because he would have indicated it to the Commission’s investigator at an earlier time.  
     
      
    54 He was referring to counsel assisting the Commission’s request for document 1711747 to be brought up “on the screen”. This document was a copy of Eastwood’s duty book for Friday 26 September 1986. The entries in the book for that day include: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “…….then with Det Hannay interview Bruce Malcolm Thomas born 19.9.47……” (exhibit C volume 1 at 020).  
          
         
        
       
      
    55 He was asked (T 563): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Q. And if the evidence was there would you agree that on your understanding of the verballing process back in 1986 there would be no need to verbal; was that your understanding? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A. Well, if the evidence was there there would be no need to verbal.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    56 He agreed he had no recollection of how strong the prosecution case was before he gave evidence to the Commission. He was subsequently asked (T 568 – 569): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Q. And would you agree that in terms of your admitted involvement in verballing suspects up to 1996 when you were a police officer, you may have in fact simply got it wrong as to who was verballed on what day and who was with you? 
          
         
        
       
      
     A. No. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          Q. When you say no, the reality is you’re not in a position today to be able to even deny that last question I asked you, are you? 
          
         
        
       
      
     A. I don’t believe I’m wrong. 
     
      
     Q. You’re not in a position to deny it, are you? 
     
      
     A. I said I don’t believe I am wrong.” 
     
      
    57 It is clear that Eastwood was not mistaken in his recollection who it was he was saying to the Commission was verballed. He was asked by the Commissioner (see exhibit 10 p 21616): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Q. Was Mr Thomas convicted? 
          
         
        
       
      
     A. Yes, he was, your Honour. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          Q. To your recollection, would he have served that sentence by now? 
          
         
        
       
      
     A. Possibly, your Honour. 
     
      
     Q. I take it he was already serving a sentence? 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          A. He was serving a sentence at the time and, like, the bashing happened in gaol and he was convicted some time after this incident and I think he was given seven years, I think. 
          
         
        
       
      
     Q. On top of the existing sentence or concurrent? 
     
      
     A. I’m not certain of that. 
     
      
     Q. I take it was a fairly serious assault? 
     
      
     A. Yes. He made the fellow a vegetable, yes.” 
     
      
    58 Gollan suffered extensive brain damage in the assault.  
     
      
    59 Eastwood had told the Commissioner that there were more cases in which his evidence had been more untruthful than truthful (T 563). How he came to identify in 1996 by the use of his duty book that Thomas had been verballed was not explored before the Commission nor does it appear that his evidence was challenged. He agreed in this Court that he had been involved in numerous matters in which he had verballed suspects or persons of interest and there was nothing exceptional in his mind which stood out as to what occurred on 26 September 1986 (T 586).  
     
      
    60 Notwithstanding Eastwood’s revelations to the Commission, Hannay was neither advised by representatives of the Commission of the evidence nor was he provided with the opportunity to challenge what Eastwood had said. 
     
      
    61 Hannay in the present proceedings gave evidence that on the 25 September 1986 after the interview of Mitchell Winefield (Winefield) he, Snell, Brown and Eastwood discussed the appropriate charges that would be preferred against the plaintiff, Winefield and Nicholson the next day. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Regardless of what was going to be done, whether they partook in an interview or not, they would have been charged with those offences as of the 25th” (T 636). 
        
       
      
    62 Snell supported this evidence. He said on the evening of the 25th, he conferred with Hannay and Brown and they all agreed that they had sufficient information to charge the three offenders with attempt murder regardless of what might be said the following day by the plaintiff and Nicholson (T 520). A charge of malicious wounding was to be a back up charge. 
     
      
    63 Winefield had participated in a record of interview conducted by Snell in the presence of Brown on the evening of the 25 September 1986. The interview was recorded by Brown on a typewriter. During the interview Winefield said that “Thommo” told him they grabbed Gollan and “through (sic) him up against the wall.” And “One held the top half of him and another held him by the legs, they threw him head first into the wall.” (see exhibit C volume 1, Q 44 at 143 and Q 63 at 147). 
     
      
    64 Hannay said that on the 25th he knew that Winefield was going to plead guilty and was to give evidence against the plaintiff and Nicholson. He had formed the view that it was significant that Winefield had said that when he left the cell there was no skin broken, there was no blood and from the blood in the cell, it was “easy to deduce that a massive assault had taken place after the initial assault by Winefield on Gollan” (T 629). 
     
      
    65 Hannay was aware that Bell had identified the plaintiff as being the person at cell 210 who told him not to be in the cell when his mate got back. 
     
      
    66 Nicholson had been interviewed by Snell and Brown at Parramatta police station at 1.15pm on the 26 September. During the interview Nicholson had told the police officers that the “cunt [Gollan] was still breathing. Thommo and I grabbed him and rammed his head into the wall to finish the cunt”. Hannay prior to commencing the second interview was informed that these admissions had been made.  
     
      
    67 The extent of the evidence which had been marshalled against the plaintiff prior to the second interview raises the question as to why Hannay and Eastwood would be motivated to fabricate confessional material by the plaintiff. Hannay acknowledged, however, in cross-examination that he believed at the time of the second interview that the Crown case would be improved if he was able to obtain an admission from the plaintiff (T 683). He was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you certainly believed at that time, that is on the day when you were going to interview Mr Thomas, that day, 26 September 1986, you believed that the case against him would be improved if you were able to obtain an admission from him, didn’t you? 
        
       
      
     A. Most probable. 
     
      
     Q. Most definitely, isn’t it? 
     
      
       
        
        A. Yes, it would have been far better and as it turned out is far better to have direct evidence or oral evidence from the perpetrator or from whoever has created the crime to have a confession of course.”  
        
       
      
    68 The working relationship between Hannay and Eastwood does not indicate a likelihood that they would conspire to give false evidence. It was not close. Hannay said he had little knowledge of Eastwood prior to the Gollan investigation and Eastwood recalled that the investigation was the only time he worked with Hannay. Hannay left the police force in 1988 having been offered a job in Queensland and has lived in that State since that time.  
     
      
    69 The interviewing procedure Hannay said he used during the second interview was that he would write down a question in his official note book, ask the question and then write down the answer. Eastwood was present and did not take notes. 
     
      
    70 Hannay’s adoption of this procedure was challenged by Mr Peluso during the criminal trial. It is evident that Hannay was aware that the procedure of a formal record of interview could have been adopted with questions and answers, the movements of police and the suspect being recorded by typewriter with the time of the conclusion of the interview being noted at the end. Hannay when asked by Mr Peluso why this procedure was not used replied that he “chose not to use it” (exhibit C, volume 2 at 077). 
     
      
    71 Hannay gave similar evidence before this Court but when asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Were there any reasons for that particular choice that come to mind?”  
        
       
      
     Replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Only if the typewriter or documentation weren’t in the room or if it was more convenient to use the notebook that I had that I always carried with me in a simple record of interview, if there was going to be a large amount of questions or we prepared a large amount of questions to put to an offender or somebody else we may have chosen to type them then go through a pre – with a – you might say if we had a lot of information already gathered and we had prepared questions we wanted to ask, we may have typed them but in an off–the-cuff interview it would normally be done just in a notebook and that was a process that was normally adopted, regularly adopt in those days” (T 685). 
        
       
      
    72 Hannay had earlier agreed that a typewriter and paper was standard equipment in the interviewing rooms. Parramatta police station was one of the largest in the State. The procedure of a formal record of interview had been adopted by Snell and Brown when Winefield had been interviewed the previous night. A large amount of information implicating the plaintiff in the commission of the offences had been gathered prior to the second interview. There were a large number of questions which could have been put to the plaintiff. It seems to me in those circumstances to be extraordinary that “an off–the-cuff” interview would be conducted. After all, exculpatory statements had been made by the plaintiff in the first interview.  
     
      
    73 Mr Peluso closely questioned Hannay about his familiarity with a procedure of a senior police officer independent of the investigation being called in to enquire of the person being interviewed whether he had any complaint to make and as to the truth and voluntariness of the statements said to have been made in the interview. He was further questioned as to his failure to adopt this procedure at the conclusion of the interview. It was, Hannay said, most probable that there would have been a senior officer available at the time. When asked why he did not call in a senior independent officer, Hannay replied that “he chose not to adopt that procedure”. (Exhibit C vol 2 at 078). 
     
      
    74 In this Court, Hannay was asked by senior counsel for the plaintiff (T 686): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. But an aspect of doing interviews with the assistance of notebooks in those days was that when the interview was over you would go and get a senior officer to come and talk to the person, confirm that that was the interview, wasn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, but – yes, that could happen but it wasn’t generally a process that happened all the time.  
        
       
      
     Q. It didn’t happen all the time but it was available, wasn’t it? 
     
      
     A. Yes.  
     
      
       
        
        Q. And it was a very good process for one reason certainly, wasn’t it, that it made it much harder for the person after the event to have second thoughts and say: That’s not what I said? 
        
       
      
     A. I don’t understand what you’re saying. 
     
      
       
        
        Q. You had had the experience as an investigator of having people sometimes tell you that something happened or they had done something and then trying to wriggle out of that later and say that’s not what they said exactly or they didn’t say it at all? 
        
       
      
     A. Yes. 
     
      
     Q. People backing out was not an unusual phenomenon? 
     
      
       
        
        A.  
        It would be very unusual for someone to partake of an interview and then come back and say: That’s not right” 
         (emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    75 The rationale proffered by Hannay for not calling in an independent officer is, in my view, implausible. Hannay’s account of the second interview included the plaintiff being asked if he wished “to sign these notes” to which he responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “You’re kidding.” (Exhibit C vol 2 at 068) 
        
       
       
      The demonstrated indisposition to acknowledging the contents of the note book should have provided clear warning to an experienced police officer (which Hannay was) that the oral confession would not be adhered to by the plaintiff. To my mind it is remarkable that Hannay in the circumstances did not seek to confirm the making of the oral admissions by the use of an independent officer. A serious crime was being investigated and Hannay knew that the admissions would improve the Crown case.  
       
      
    76 Eastwood during the criminal trial described the plaintiff as not seeming “to care” and speaking “fairly freely” during the second interview. Hough in this Court referred to the plaintiff’s position in the ‘prison hierarchy’ and in their mind being ‘worthy of some respect’. Hough opined if [the police] were polite and respectful “they would respond positively to that and tell you what you wanted to know sometimes” (T 337). Hough’s assessment has been advanced by the State as providing a possible explanation for the oral confessions said to have been made. 
     
      
    77 At the time of the second interview the plaintiff was well versed in the criminal justice system. He was unaware that Bell had identified him and Winefield had implicated him in the commission of the offences. I am unable to accept that the plaintiff would either be so naive or arrogant to orally make admissions to the commission of serious crimes which included in response to the question “Did you intend to kill him?” The answer: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yeah, he should be dead.” 
        
       
      
    78 During his statement from the dock the plaintiff told the jury that at no stage did he see either detective making notes, nor was he asked to read any notes, nor was he shown any (exhibit C vol 2 at 115).  
     
      
    79 The informality of the procedure used by Hannay and Eastwood to conduct the second interview provided fertile ground for the fabrication of oral admissions. In my assessment Hannay was not telling the truth in the criminal trial when he denied that was a reason for the manner in which the interview was conducted. Hannay’s evidence in this Court concerning the second interview I did not find to be credible.  
     
      
    80 Eastwood’s ability to identify to the Commission that Thomas had been “verballed” arose from his knowledge of the truth of what had occurred. I am satisfied that Eastwood’s evidence before the Commission relevant to the present proceedings was truthful. 
     
      
    81 Notwithstanding the deficiencies identified in the plaintiff’s testimony in this Court, I conclude that oral admissions were not made. 
     
      
    82 I am, bearing in mind the nature and seriousness of the allegation that the plaintiff was “verballed”, satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the oral admissions said to have been made by the plaintiff during the second interview were in fact not made and were fabricated by Hannay and Eastwood. 
     
      
    83 Senior counsel for the plaintiff referred to Hannay’s apparent clear recollection of events occurring over twenty years ago and his inability to remember who had informed him of the quashing of the plaintiff’s convictions. The plaintiff contends that the Court would have significant concerns about the credibility of Hannay. Save for Hannay’s evidence concerning the fabricated admissions, I found his evidence to be generally reliable. It does not surprise me that he was readily able to recall the police investigation into the assaults upon Gollan. After all, he resigned from the police force in 1988, the year in which he had given false evidence in the criminal trial of the admissions.  
     
      
       
      The material available to Hannay 
       
      
    84 As the question whether the criminal proceedings were commenced without reasonable and probable cause directs attention to the material Hannay had available for consideration when deciding to commence the prosecution it is necessary for that material to be identified. He did not have the oral admissions which have been found to be fabricated. 
     
      
    85 In identifying the available material it is to be recognised that Hannay was a member of the police investigation team led by Snell. Members of the team conferred regularly, meetings were held and information was shared. As Snell said, Hannay was informed “like the other police officers in the investigation of all new leads or information or enquiries which needed to be carried out” (T510). 
     
      
    86 Prior to charging the plaintiff Hannay had available on 26 September 1986 the following material: 
     
      
       
      Information from Brian Bell 
       
      
    87 On the 14 August 1986, the day on which Gollan was assaulted, Brian Bell (Bell) was his cellmate. Bell was in custody for unpaid fines.  
     
      
    88 On the day of the attack, Bell wrote out a statement in which he related being in the cell with Gollan and Gollan being called away. Mitchell (Winefield) called back into the cell and was talking ‘small talk’ with him when a prisoner entered and said “when your mate comes back to the cell make yourself scarce” (exhibit C volume 1 at p 21). Winefield and the other prisoner then left. Bell, shortly thereafter, applied for protection to the warden on duty, which was subsequently granted. 
     
      
    89 Bell entered into a typed record of interview on the 27 August 1986 conducted by Snell (exhibit C volume 1 at pp 77-81). He described the prisoner being at the door of the cell and heard him say “this is the cell” or words to that effect. The prisoner then approached the door near where [Winefield] was and said to Bell ‘Don’t be in the cell when your mate gets back”. (Exhibit C volume 1 p 78 Q12). He stated (Q13) when he was waiting outside the wings for the officer to come back, a prisoner came up to him and said “looks like you will be on your own tonight you (sic) mate just got a bashing. That is what he gets for belting woman.” 
     
      
    90 On the 29 August 1986 Bell was shown at the Parramatta police station eight photographs. He identified the man in photograph number 3. He believed this to be the man who came to the cell on 14 August 1986 and said to him “Don’t be in the cell when your mate gets back.” He also recognised him as being the man who came to the cell and had spoken to Gollan’s friend Mitchell Winefield. The picture marked 3 was that of the plaintiff.  
     
      
    91 Snell informed Hannay that Bell had positively identified the plaintiff as being the person who attended the cell on the day of the attack (T652).  
     
      
       
      The first interview  
       
      
    92 The identification of material available to Hannay necessarily requires a determination of whether the plaintiff was “verballed” during the first interview. 
     
      
    93 The running sheet (exhibit C volume 1 at 85) records (inter alia) that the plaintiff “further stated that Gollan was ‘king hit’ with a fist two or three times and had his head jumped on. [He] “further stated that he thought Gollan was the correct target of the assault for bashing prisoners wives and girlfriends” and Thomas stated that: 
     
      
       
        
        “the police should not waste their time looking in ‘A’ or ‘B’ wing. He indicated that he knew the identity of the offender but was not prepared to say who was responsible”. 
        
       
      
    94 The plaintiff denied in the present proceedings making these representations to police. 
     
      
    95 In his statement from the dock the plaintiff told the jury that at no stage in the [first] interview did he say that he “knew who was responsible for the attack on Mr Gollan and refused to tell the police officers who it was because at that stage he didn’t know who attacked Mr Gollan.” (Exhibit C volume 2 at 114).  
     
      
    96 Hough who signed the running sheet told this Court in evidence-in-chief that there was no impropriety of any kind during the course of the interview.  
     
      
    97 He went on to say that he had no independent recollection of [the interview] because there were no admissions by the plaintiff and nothing stood out in his recollection. It was, he said, “fairly innocuous” (T336). 
     
      
    98 Senior counsel for the plaintiff in accordance with his assurance at the commencement of cross-examination did not suggest to Hough that there was any verbal or any sort of inappropriate activity in the first interview  
     
      
      (T337). Hannay confirmed that the [contents] of the running sheet correctly reflected what occurred during the first interview. This evidence was unchallenged. 
       
      
    99 The accounts of Hough and Hannay of the first interview I found to be credible and I am not satisfied that any part of their account of what was said to them by the plaintiff was fabricated. 
     
      
    100 The material available to Hannay included the plaintiff’s account which is accurately recorded in the running sheet.  
     
      
    101 Hannay also knew from prison officer Windship (Windship) that about 2.00pm on the day of the assault he had been approached by the plaintiff and Nicholson. The plaintiff told Windship that he better go on and check the bloke in 210 cell, he’s got a bloody nose, we picked him up and threw him on the bed. 
     
      
    102 No mention was made by Windship of seeing any blood on the plaintiff. 
     
      
    103 During the first interview the plaintiff represented that he had been in the gym with Gavin Honnery, Charles Amos and Nicholson working out for two hours from about 11.30am. He and Nicholson were on their way back to Nicholson’s cell for a cup of tea.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Mitchell Winefield 
       
      
    104 Winefield on the 27 August 1986 denied any involvement in the attack on Gollan (exhibit C volume 1 pp 82 –84). On the 25 September 1986 he was interviewed by Snell and Brown. Shortly after being cautioned by Snell he was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Are you aware as a result of Gollan being bashed he is in critical condition at Westmead Hospital suffering from head injuries?”  
        
       
      
     To which he replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yeah, I feel pretty bad about what happened and I haven’t been able to sleep much.” (Exhibit C volume 1 at 157) 
        
       
      
    105 Winefield then participated in a typed record of interview during which he stated Gollan had told him about his wife Kim being punched at Blacktown. He described ‘Thommo’ coming into the cell and closing the door after which, he [Winefield] punched Gollan around the head and left him unconscious on the floor. Winefield stated that he and the plaintiff left the cell and went to the plaintiff’s cell so that he could wash his face. He said looking down from the top landing into Gollan’s cell, he could see Gollan’s legs and he [Gollan] was not moving. The plaintiff said ‘don’t worry about it’, he would go and see if he was alright and tell the ‘screws about him’. Later on, he had a conversation with the plaintiff and Nicholson during which the plaintiff told him that he gave Gollan ‘first aid’ by punching him around the face and they grabbed him and threw him against the wall (exhibit C volume 1 QQ 15 – 16 at 142, Q17 at 143). He further related, as I have quoted at paragraph 63 above, the plaintiff telling him how they threw Gollan against the wall.  
     
      
    106 After the interview Snell and Brown met with Hannay. Snell recalled the [record] of interview being shown to Hannay who appeared to read it. Hannay said that he was told by Snell and Brown what Winefield had related to them and had a clear recollection of reading the interview but not “every word of it” (T667). In cross-examination Hannay’s attention was drawn to an answer given in the criminal trial that he “was aware the interview was taken but….wasn’t aware of the contents”. In response, Hannay reasoned that his answers which followed set out what had happened, that there were certain aspects of the interview which he didn’t read (T669-670). 
     
      
    107 It seems to me to make little difference whether Hannay had fully read the record of interview or not. Winefield’s statement to police was regarded as a major break through in the investigation. Hannay detailed (T629) his recollection of the information provided to him of the interview. I am satisfied that Hannay had been briefed by Snell and Brown of the allegations made by Winefield against the plaintiff and that he comprehended fully these allegations even though he may not have read every word of the record of interview.  
     
      
    108 Winefield told this Court that he made it known to police at the end of the interview that he was prepared to give evidence against Nicholson and the plaintiff although he did not want to (T427). Snell deposed that Winefield said during the interview he was prepared to give evidence against the other two. Brown also gave evidence to this effect.  
     
      
    109 The plaintiff contends that this evidence is contrary to contemporaneous documentation and is “unbelievable”. The plaintiff points to Snell’s statement of 17 March 1987 which is to be contrasted with the lack of any written record of Winefield’s indication that he was prepared to give evidence. 
     
      
    110 Snell’s statement records a visit with Winefield at Long Bay on 17 March 1987 by Brown and himself during which Winefield said that he was prepared to give evidence for police if he was sent up on the charge of malicious wounding and not an “attempt murder charge”. 
     
      
    111 A further ground for the contention of implausibility, the plaintiff argues, is the maintenance of the plea of not guilty by Winefield until the charge against him was reduced to assault occasioning actual bodily harm just before the criminal trial in 1988. The plaintiff submits that fact supports the view that the first time any agreement for Winefield to give evidence was reached was at the meeting with Snell and Brown on 17 March 1987, when the groundwork for the deal was first postulated by Winefield. 
     
      
    112 In this Court Snell said that it was his normal procedure not to include in the record of interview information that the [interviewee] was prepared to give evidence. He did not do so for Winefield’s safety as his life would be in danger within the gaol system (T515). He was not prepared to supply a copy of the interview to Winefield as it would be in his property when he was returned to gaol and the possibility was other persons may get their hands on it (T516). He spoke to Winefield about the dangers of receiving the record of interview and he declined to take a copy (T590). His interpretation of the meeting of the 17 March 1987 was that Winefield was seeking for the charges to be dropped and he [Snell] would see what he could do in that regard but Winefield was still prepared to give evidence even if the charges were not reduced (T596). His attitude to recording important events was that “some [he] did; some [he] didn’t” (T597). He recorded the discussion with Winefield on 17 March 1987 as he was requested to (T598).  
     
      
    113 Winefield’s disinclination to take a copy of the interview of 25 September 1986 is recorded in Snell’s duty book. 
     
      
    114 In his testimony to this Court Winefield referred to the danger of the record of interview being in his property within the prison system as being the reason he did not take a copy of the interview (T427). He explained that he withheld the entry of a plea of guilty at the committal out of “self preservation” and his desire not to go on protection (T428-429). 
     
      
    115 The suggestion made at committal to Snell that his interview was not given freely was made by his solicitor on his instructions as he was having “second thoughts, trying to get out of it……….trying to get out of giving evidence……” (T429). He described having “cold feet”. Winefield said the small period of doubt remained for about “a week or so” after the committal. He explained that the delay in entering the plea was basically due to the various changes he had in his legal representation (T431). In cross-examination he refuted the suggestion that he had not made up his mind to give evidence against his co-accused until very shortly before his trial and said that if his [willingness] had become public knowledge he would have been in danger (T495). He related that at the time of the interview in September 1986 he didn’t know the giving of evidence against the co-accused would help him on sentence, he was just willing to accept his responsibility (T497).  
     
      
    116 Winefield’s then fear of disclosure is manifest. Notwithstanding the plaintiff’s denials he and Nicholson were regarded as “heavies” within the prison system. Revelation that Winefield had turned informer would place him in jeopardy. The lack of a record of his willingness on 25 September 1986 to testify against his co-accused, his ‘second thoughts’ at committal and the delay in his guilty plea are understandable. The annunciation of co-operation was founded on remorse. The evidence of Winefield and Snell on this issue is consistent and credible. There is no real possibility that consistency arose from collaboration between these witnesses nor does senior counsel for the plaintiff make such a suggestion. The contention is that their account of events was the product of distant, reconstructed and ‘quite likely’ partisan memory. I do not find that to be so. I reject the contention that the evidence is unbelievable and accept on this issue the evidence of Winefield, Snell and Brown. 
     
      
    117 Hannay, I am further satisfied, was informed by Snell that Winefield told him that he would give evidence against the other two.  
     
      
    118 The motive, the plaintiff contends, given by Winefield for the plaintiff’s attack on Gollan is attended by significant doubt. The plaintiff points to the inconsistencies in the various accounts by Winefield and submits that they are destructive of the credibility of the evidence given before this Court by Winefield. During the interview on the 25 September 1986, Winefield said he told the plaintiff Gollan had given his wife a “hard time” and owed him “some money”. In a statement made to police in May 1988, he stated he told the plaintiff that Gollan had “bashed” and “robbed” his fiancée as a result of which she was put in hospital. At the criminal trial, Winefield testified that his ‘wife’ was beaten severely enough to have a miscarriage. No evidence was given about money being stolen. Winefield told this Court his best memory of events was that his wife told him that he [Gollan] had hit her and took some money.  
     
      
    119 In cross-examination, Winefield spoke, inter alia, of the various visits by his partner to the goal, his different manner of speaking at the time he was in custody, the uncertainty of his relationship with his former partner and his attempts to suppress and distance himself from that unhappy part of his life. Although this evidence does not conclusively resolve apparent inconsistencies, it does provide some explanation for them. I do not consider that the various accounts generally undermine his credibility. Winefield impressed me as being in this Court a truthful witness.  
     
      
       
      Observations of cell 210 ‘B’ 
       
      
    120 At paragraph 39 above I have summarised to the observations of Hough and Johnson of the staining of the wall in cell 210 ‘B’. Hannay inspected the cell with Hough on the day of the assault and attended on the next day with Johnson. Hannay said (T615): 
     
      
       
        
        “I saw that there was blood on the floor, a large amount or (sic) congealed or pooled blood on the floor. I saw a double bunk on the left – as you walk into the cell on the left-hand side there was blood on the pillows and the mattress. I saw splatterings of blood which appeared to extend from the mattress level of the wall and then continue up the wall towards the second bunk level. I also saw blood, a reasonable amount of blood splatterings and blood on the far wall in the cell itself. I also saw blood on the pillows and the mattress area.” 
        
       
      
    121 Snell said he viewed the original photographs taken by Johnson and recalled that the blood splatters were evenly spread over a varied measurement on the wall “like someone had got a paint brush and just flicked the paint onto the wall”. He was of the opinion that it would have had to be more than one person to cause that splattering of blood. It appeared to him consistent with two persons ramming a person’s head into that wall (T522). He said he could see that extreme force had been used by placing the victim’s head towards the cell wall causing a splattering of blood which was consistent with Winefield’s interview on the 25th September. He rang Johnson on the same night and told him what Winefield had said in the record of interview. Johnson told him that [account] would have been consistent with the injuries to Gollan as shown in the photograph from the scientific police of the scene (T522).  
     
      
     Gollan’s injuries  
     
      
    122 Hannay had been informed that there was a probability that Gollan would die as a result of the injuries, that he had severe brain damage and head trauma, and if he survived, he would have severe brain damage. He recalled talking to doctors about how the injury took place and was informed that the injury would have had to have been done by either a heavy object or his head being smashed against the wall. Gollan, he was informed, would have had to have been unconscious or in a semi-state of unconsciousness for his head to have been smashed against the wall (T 620).  
     
      
    123 Snell said that the medical personnel at the hospital from whom he obtained information agreed that the severe head injuries Gollan sustained were consistent with someone’s head being rammed against a wall (T523).  
     
      
       
      Information from informers 
       
      
    124 Snell had received information from prisoners and Corrective Service Officers that Thomas and Nicholson were known as “enforcers or heavies” within the gaol system and that Nicholson was in gaol on remand for sentence for attempt murder of a police officer. 
     
      
    125 Hannay said information had been received from a person outside the gaol system after Winefield’s interview on 27 August that Winefield was concerned about Gollan who had been a long standing friend. He had gone to school with him. Winefield’s initial involvement, they were informed, was to give him a hiding for his involvement with his wife. Winefield was remorseful about what subsequently happened to Gollan after he had initially assaulted him (T624). Steps were then taken to re-interview Winefield.  
     
      
       
      The interview with Nicholson 
       
      
    126 As related at paragraph 66 above, Nicholson was interviewed at 1.15pm on the 26 September 1986. Nicholson was asked by Snell (exhibit C volume 1 at 163): 
     
      
       
        
        “We have been informed that you and another prisoner named Bruce Thomas went to Gollan’s cell after he had been assaulted by Winefield. Do you want to say anything about that?” 
        
       
      
     He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yeah, we went there alright and gave the cunt what he should have got in the first place”. 
        
       
       
      Detective Snell said, “Can you tell us what you did to Gollan when you went back to his cell?” 
       
       
      He said: 
       
       
        
        “The cunt was still breathing. Thommo and I grabbed him and rammed his head into the wall to finish the cunt.” 
        
       
       
      In the present proceedings, it is not contended that these admissions were fabricated by police. 
       
      
    127 Although the information from the informers and Nicholson’s admissions would be inadmissible as evidence in criminal proceedings against the plaintiff, Hannay was entitled to consider this material in forming an honest view that there was a proper case for prosecuting the plaintiff: see Hicks v Faulkner (1878) 8 QBD 167 at 173. 
     
      
     What should the prosecutor have made of the available material? 
     
      
    Information from Brian Bell 
     
      
    128 It is contended for the plaintiff that Bell’s identification of the plaintiff was made in such circumstances as to cause a reasonable prosecutor to have doubts about its reliability. The plaintiff argues that it took ten minutes for Bell to identify him and the photograph identified him as a 39 years old and showed him with a moustache. 
     
      
    129 Bell did not know Nicholson, Winefield or the plaintiff prior to 14 August 1986 nor did he know any of the members of the police investigation team. He was an independent witness. Eight photographs were shown to him by police on the 29 August 1986. As Bell said, the police made no effort to induce him and the identification was made without prompting. 
     
      
    130 During the criminal trial and in this Court the plaintiff postulated that Bell had told lies because he wanted protective custody (T160). At the time of the identification Bell was in protection. In any event, Bell impressed me as an honest and reliable witness and the plaintiff’s postulation is rejected. 
     
      
    131 The time during which and the distance from which Bell had the opportunity to identify the person who spoke to him was explored by Snell in an interview with Bell on 27 August 1986. The length of time between the initial perception by Bell and the photo identification was not such, in my view, to significantly weaken the reliability of the identification nor was the time taken by Bell in selecting photograph number three. The time taken was not necessarily indicative of an equivocal identification. It was also consistent with an assertion made after careful consideration. 
     
      
    132 Hannay did not know how long Bell had taken to choose photograph number three nor precisely what he had said at the time of identification. Snell had informed him that Bell had positively identified the plaintiff as being the person who attended the cell on the day of the attack. 
     
      
    133 In my opinion, it is of no consequence in the circumstances that Hannay was unaware of these matters. Bell had identified the plaintiff and the identification was part of the material which was available to Hannay.  
     
      
    134 It seems from the plaintiff’s written submissions that some reliance is placed on the identified photograph being one of the plaintiff with a moustache. I am unable to recall or find in the transcript of the present proceedings any evidence that the plaintiff did not have a moustache at the time of the Gollan assault. 
     
      
    135 Bell said during close scrutiny by Mr Peluso at the criminal trial that he recognised [the plaintiff] by the moustache (exhibit C volume 2 028). To my mind, if it had been asserted that the plaintiff did not have a moustache at the time of the assault such a question would have been put to him by Mr Peluso. It was not. Bell in re-examination said that a difference in the appearance of the accused then before the Court was the accused did not have a moustache. The accused in his statement from the dock did not assert that he did not have a moustache at the time of the assault. The reference in written submissions to the moustache has no significance. 
     
      
    136 The circumstances of the identification, I consider, were not such as to cause doubt in the mind of a reasonable prosecutor.  
     
      
       
      Observations of cell 210 ‘B’ 
       
      
    137 It is submitted for the plaintiff that Hannay saw a large pool of congealed blood on the floor of the cell, however, his evidence suggested he had not really turned his mind to that fact prior to laying the charges against the plaintiff.  
     
      
    138 Hannay was asked (T680): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I suggest you got Mr Winefield’s account and you galloped with it without any thought at all? 
        
       
      
     A. That’s not true. 
     
      
       
        
        Q. I have just demonstrated to you one thing you didn’t think about, haven’t I?  
        
       
       
        
        A. I just told you I would have thought about a number of things. There was blood on the floor, there was blood on the wall, there were blood splatter marks up the wall in between the two beds, it was obvious that someone who was either lying on the bed had been forced on to the bed and it would have been impossible for someone to be put on the bed and lie there and spatter marks up. If they had been punched while lying on the bed and a (sic) there was a large amount of blood, it’s possible blood could have sprayed up. I very much doubt whether it would have come off someone else’s hand on to the wall. That’s not a reasonable assumption.” 
        
       
      
    139 Hannay, I am satisfied, gave consideration to the blood on the floor. He reflected upon a number of possibilities as to how the assault may have occurred. 
     
      
    140 It seems, however, Hannay gave little consideration to a possibility that the blood splatter occurred when someone punched Gollan in the face nor did he direct his mind to a possibility that the blood he had seen in the cell had been occasioned by Winefield’s attack on Gollan. 
     
      
    141 Hannay was asked (T681): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you direct your mind at all to the possibility that in attacking Gollan in a rage he [Winefield] had gone much further than he had meant to? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well, I had no reason to disbelieve what he had said in his record of interview. From memory he said he punched him eight to ten times on the side of the temple and he felt – I think I recall his legs went and he let him go and he fell unconscious to the ground. I also recalled him saying when he left there was no blood or broken skin.” 
        
       
      
    142 There was no evidence or information at that stage, Hannay said, to think that Winefield was telling lies. 
     
      
    143 The material then available to Hannay strongly pointed to the veracity of Winefield’s account. Bell had identified the plaintiff which suggested that the plaintiff’s account during the first interview may be untruthful and no explanation had been proffered by him as to how the blood came to be on the wall next to the pillow. Bell’s identification provided independent support for the reliability of Winefield’s account. Nicholson’s admissions, moreover, confirmed that Winefield was telling the truth. The blood stains in cell 210 ‘B’ were consistent with the accounts given by Winefield and Nicholson as were Gollan’s injuries. It was not unreasonable for Hannay in the circumstances to have given scant consideration to the possibility that the blood in the cell was caused by Winefield. 
     
      
    144 In written submissions the plaintiff argues that from an examination of the photographs (Exhibit 2) it appears there is no blood marking consistent with a smudge stain occurring as a result of Gollan’s head being rammed against the wall and the blood splatter above the bunk bed is in light droplet form. As a result the plaintiff contends the blood splatter pattern is consistent with the plaintiff’s dock statement where he said that Gollan was choking and making gurgling sounds and inconsistent with a heavy blow from the skull which would be more likely to produce “ a smear” or “smudge” 
     
      
    145 It suffices to say in answer to this submission that little can be discerned from the photocopies of the photographs which constitute exhibit 2 due to their poor quality. The descriptions of the blood splatter given by Hough, Johnson and Hannay, all of whom visited the cell are, in my view, reliable and consistent with the accounts of the assaults given by Winefield and Nicholson. No evidence was given in this Court or during the criminal trial that the blood splatter was consistent with the plaintiff’s dock statement. As I have observed at paragraph 41 and 43 above, this matter was not put to Hannay nor Eastwood (nor any other witness) during the criminal trial.  
     
      
       
      Mitchell Winefield 
       
      
    146 The plaintiff asserts that the police did not do enough to establish the veracity of Winefield’s account. The police failed, it is submitted, to: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) undertake any investigation of Winefield’s history which would have revealed his propensity for very violent attacks; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) determine whether Gollan’s fall to the ground (after being rendered unconscious by Winefield) could have been sufficient to have contributed to his injuries; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) determine whether the large pool of blood on the floor of the cell could have come from Gollan’s nose and mouth after Winefield left the cell; and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) most significantly failed to question whether Winefield was attempting to shift blame from himself for an attack which simply got out of hand. 
        
       
      
    147 Snell, it seems, made some enquiries into Winefield’s background. He was asked (T609): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Well let’s start with what he was in gaol for at the time? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I would have made enquiries. I can’t recall exactly what he was…in gaol for. Blacktown warrants, he came from Blacktown police station cutting warrants out.” 
        
       
      
    148 It was Bell and not Winefield who was in custody for unpaid fines. Over twenty years have passed since the police investigation. It is not surprising Snell could not accurately recall the reasons for Winefield’s incarceration. Snell’s misconception does not mean enquiries were not made. Winefield, it appears, was serving concurrent sentences for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and for assault. He told this Court that one sentence was being served for assault with the use of a cricket bat and the other for an assault upon Ronald Hooper in Penrith cells. Both victims were rendered unconscious. Snell, it is more probable than not, would have ascertained why Winefield was an inmate in the gaol. Hannay did not interview Winefield and relied on the information received from Snell and Brown. 
     
      
    149 Snell assessed Winefield as being genuine in his expression of guilt and remorse as to what had happened to Gollan. Winefield had gone to school with Gollan and had grown up with him. Hannay said he had no evidence or information to think that Winefield was telling lies. 
     
      
    150 The plaintiff complains that the police should have determined whether Gollan’s fall to the ground could have been sufficient to have contributed to his injuries and failed to question whether Winefield was attempting to shift the blame. I have summarised at paragraph 122 and 123 above the information received concerning Gollan’s injuries.  
     
      
    151 Hannay was informed by doctors “that the injury would have had to have been done by either a heavy object or his [Gollan’s] head being smashed against the wall”. (T620) 
     
      
    152 Hannay was asked (T 620): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And the mechanics of how his head came to be smashed against the wall, did you obtain any information in relation to that or what? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Someone at that particular time would have had to have done it because he was unconscious or in semi-state of unconscious at one particular time of the assault.”  
        
       
      
    153 In cross-examination, Snell gave the evidence which follows (T610): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What information had you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That the victim was in an unconscious condition in the cell and it would have needed two persons at least to pick him up and drive his head into the wall. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you didn’t understand any circumstance in which one person could do that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It wouldn’t be possible, sir, with the amount of force that was used. 
        
       
      
     Q. How did you know that? 
     
      
       
        
        A. Because it was told to me by the doctors. That was consistent with the injuries he had received. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say consistent with injuries he received, what do you mean by the word “consistent”? 
        
       
       
        
        A. How the injuries were sustained by the victim as one of the doctors described it to me, it was consistent in his words by a person being picked up and their head being driven into the cell wall.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now in just the way you understood words, when somebody said that to you did you understand that as meaning that way of doing it could be the only way of doing it or that that could be one possible way of doing it? 
        
       
      
     A. The most likely way it was done, sir. 
     
      
       
        
        Q. But leaving the possibility that it could have been done in other ways, is that what you mean? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Possibly it could have been done in other ways but most likely in the manner in which I have described.” 
        
       
      
    154 Snell and Hannay were entitled to consider that Winefield’s account was the most likely explanation for the infliction of the head injuries upon Gollan. Nicholson’s admissions provided a buttress for the view that the head injuries were sustained when Gollan’s head was rammed into the cell wall. Although Winefield was criminally concerned in the attack upon Gollan the identification by Bell independently supported the truth of his account. They were not required in the circumstances of the material available to them to determine whether Gollan’s fall could have been sufficient to have contributed to his injuries nor to question whether Winefield was attempting to shift the blame. As was said by Lord Atkin in Herniman v Smith [1938] AC 305 at 319 which was cited with approval in “A” [at 86]:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is not required of any prosecutor that he must have tested every possible relevant fact before he takes action. His duty is not to ascertain whether there is a defence, but whether there is a reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution.” 
        
       
      
    155 During the criminal trial Dr Buskall was not asked by Mr Peluso whether the head injuries could have been sustained by a person falling after being punched and hitting his head on the cell floor. The absence of cross-examination, in my view, on this point reflects the recognition by the plaintiff’s counsel at trial of the unlikelihood of the head injuries being occasioned in that way rather than any inadvertence. Dr Buskall did, however, tell the jury that the injuries to the left side of Gollan’s head were not consistent with punches by a fist and were consistent with a man being thrown against a wall.  
     
      
    156 A deficiency in the police investigation was, the plaintiff contends, the failure to interview the prisoners, Amos and Honnery, to establish whether or not the plaintiff’s alibi was corroborated before he was charged. Nicholson was one of the prisoners identified by the plaintiff as being with him in the gym. The material available to Hannay at the time the plaintiff was charged strongly confuted the honesty and reliability of the plaintiff’s account and, I might add, the innocent purpose of notifying Windship of Gollan’s state. In my opinion Hannay was not required to ascertain from Amos and Honnery whether they supported the plaintiff’s representations as to his whereabouts.  
     
      
       
      Has the plaintiff established the absence of reasonable and probable cause? 
       
      
    157 The plaintiff must prove that Hannay did not honestly form the view that there was a proper case for prosecution or must prove that Hannay formed that view an insufficient basis. The standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
    158 As mentioned in paragraphs 23, 61 and 62 above Snell, Brown, Eastwood and Hannay met on the night of 25 September 1986 after Winefield had been interviewed. They discussed the appropriate charges that would be preferred against the plaintiff and were of the view that there was sufficient evidence to substantiate the charges which were laid the next day by Hannay. Credible material pointed to the plaintiff’s guilt. The decision to lay the charges was made irrespective of what might be said by the plaintiff during the second interview. 
     
      
    159 Hannay, I am satisfied, honestly held the view on the material then available that there was a proper case for the plaintiff to be prosecuted for both charges. On the next day the belief was fortified by information of the confession made by Nicholson. 
     
      
    160 The admissions said to have been made by the plaintiff during the second interview were fabricated by Hannay to ensure that the plaintiff would be convicted. The fabrication did not occur because Hannay had not honestly formed the view there was a proper case for prosecution. 
     
      
    161 At the time of charging the plaintiff Hannay having fabricated the admissions was then in possession of material which he knew to be false. Does that mean he no longer honestly held the view that there was a proper case for prosecution? The question, to my mind, must be answered in the negative. Hannay’s knowledge of the fabricated admissions was not knowledge or belief in some fact that was inconsistent with guilt (as the plaintiff alleged in Mitchell v John Heine (1939) 38 SR 466). It was knowledge of material which had been falsified to add to the credible material previously obtained upon which Hannay’s view that there was a proper case for prosecution had been honestly formed. He was acting upon information obtained in the course of the police investigation.  
     
      
    162 The question remains whether the material then available to Hannay warranted the charges being laid. Material admissible in criminal proceedings to prove the charges consisted of (at the time the charges were laid): 
     
      
       
        
        (i) the plaintiff’s first interview; 
        
       
      
     (ii) the evidence of the prison officers Windship and Jenkins; 
     
      
     (iii) the evidence of Brian Bell; 
     
      
     (iv) the observations of blood in cell 210 ‘B’; 
     
      
     (v) the head injuries suffered by Gollan; and  
     
      
     (vi) the evidence of Mitchell Winefield. 
     
      
    163 Direct evidence was provided by Winefield of the plaintiff’s alleged participation in the initial assault upon Gollan. There was no direct evidence to prove the charge contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act 1900. The case depended upon circumstantial evidence. 
     
      
    164 Viewed in combination the evidence was capable of satisfying a properly instructed jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff in concert with Nicholson had rammed Gollan’s head with considerable force into the cell wall with the intention to kill him. The available evidence taken as a whole was capable of giving rise to no other rational inference than the inference that the plaintiff had committed the offences contrary to ss 27 and 35 of the Crimes Act 1900. Objectively assessed the material before Hannay warranted the charges being laid. There was a strong and credible case against the plaintiff. 
     
      
    165 The plaintiff has neither established that Hannay did not honestly form the view that there was a proper basis for prosecution nor that Hannay formed that view on an insufficient basis. 
     
      
    166 The plaintiff has not established the absence of reasonable and probable cause. 
     
      
       
      Did Hannay in initiating the proceedings act maliciously? 
       
      
    167 As is emphasised in “A” [at 89] “malice” in malicious prosecution is a separate element of the tort and is to be contrasted with “malice” in law which is “no more than the unlawful intent which is present whenever an injurious act is done intentionally and without just cause or excuse”: Trodbridge v Hardy (1955) 94 CLR 147 per Kitto J at 162. 
     
      
    168 What is required to be proved to establish malice is that the dominant purpose of Hannay in initiating the proceedings was a purpose other than the proper invocation of the criminal law – a purpose other than a proper purpose: see “A” [ at 91-93]. 
     
      
    169 There is no doubt that Hannay [and Eastwood] acted with malice in law when the admissions were fabricated. Hannay held, however, an honest and justifiable belief that there was a proper case for prosecution. Absent the verbal it could not be said that the proceedings were invoked other than for a proper purpose. 
     
      
    170 The purpose of the fabricated admissions was to secure a conviction. 
     
      
    171 The conviction of the plaintiff, at whatever cost, had become Hannay’s dominant purpose at the time the charges were laid. That is a purpose other than a proper purpose. The proper invocation of the criminal law demands that an accused be tried upon honest and reliable evidence and not upon false testimony. I am satisfied that Hannay acted maliciously in initiating the proceedings. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    172 The plaintiff has established that the defendant in initiating the proceedings acted maliciously. The plaintiff has not, however, established that the defendant acted without reasonable and probable cause.

      2006/653 REGINA v LISA JANE SAALFELD 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 13 March 2007 the offender, Lisa Jane Saalfeld, was convicted by a jury of a charge of murdering the deceased, Tina Maree Gestro, at Hamilton on 19 June 2005. She is now to be sentenced for that offence for which the maximum penalty prescribed is life imprisonment. There is an applicable standard non-parole period of 20 years. 
     
      
    2 The single issue before the jury was whether the offender intended to stab the deceased when they met in a confrontation on the streets of Hamilton. There were a number of witnesses who gave evidence at the trial describing the incident that occurred between the offender and the deceased. However the offender gave a version in the witness box that was to a very significant degree inconsistent with that evidence. Her account was to the effect that she had accidentally struck the deceased with a knife that she was carrying when trying to defend herself from the deceased’s attack upon her. It is clear from the jury’s verdict that they rejected this version. 
     
      
    3 The truth was that the offender intentionally stabbed the deceased with the knife after confronting her in an angry and aggressive mood. The only issue for me to determine in relation to the facts is whether the fatal stab wound to the deceased was inflicted with an intention to kill or with an intention to do grievous bodily harm. I will return to this issue later in the course of these remarks. 
     
      
    4 The facts upon which I am to sentence the offender are in a very short compass. The summary I am about to give is in accordance with the Crown case. This is chiefly because I totally reject the evidence given by the offender at the trial. It was contradicted by objective and reliable Crown witnesses and was largely implausible. 
     
      
    5 The deceased and the offender had known one another for some years. They had been close personal friends and together were involved in the drug culture in the Newcastle area. The offender was on occasions the deceased's supplier of drugs. At the date of her death the deceased was residing with her mother and daughter and was aged 33 years. At that time the offender, who was aged 44, was residing with her boyfriend, George Regan, who had a short time before been released from prison. 
     
      
    6 At Christmas in 2004 the deceased and the offender were good friends and celebrated Christmas lunch together at the home of the deceased's mother. That Christmas the deceased's daughter gave a silver chain to the deceased as a present. 
     
      
    7 At the beginning of 2005 the offender and the deceased had a falling out and their relationship gradually deteriorated until the incident resulting in the death of the deceased. The dispute arose in relation to drugs. The deceased in effect asked the offender to obtain $40 worth of drugs for her but did not have the money. Notwithstanding that they were friends, the deceased was required to give the offender the silver chain she had received from her daughter as security. The offender obtained the drugs but for some reason or other never delivered them to the deceased. The deceased then demanded the return of the silver chain but the offender failed to do so. 
     
      
    8 By April 2005 the dispute between the two women had escalated to the point where the deceased was accusing the offender of stealing money from her purse. The offender, for her part, believed that the deceased was telling lies about her, in particular to the deceased’s mother, and thereby damaging her reputation. The situation developed to the point where the offender was making public threats against the deceased. The deceased complained to her mother that the offender had called out to her that she was ""a dead woman walking"". There was an incident at a shopping mall when the offender made threats against the deceased including that she would stab her. 
     
      
    9 The offender and the deceased met in a public park in order to air their differences. This resulted in the offender threatening the deceased that, when her boyfriend George was out of prison, she would stab her. The deceased's brother came to hear of this threat and, after George was released from gaol, went to visit him and the offender. The purpose of the visit was in effect to warn off the offender by praising the fighting skills of the deceased. 
     
      
    10 At approximately 10 pm on the night of the stabbing the deceased was walking south along Beaumont Street, Hamilton when at the same time the offender and her boyfriend were walking on the same side of Beaumont Street but further south from the deceased. The offender and George were arguing with each other. They crossed to the other side of Beaumont Street and, when outside the Sydney Junction Hotel opposite the railway station car park, they stopped and became engaged in a very heated argument. This was so loud and aggressive that it drew the attention of persons in the vicinity, even to the extent of bringing one witness out of the hotel where he was playing pool to see what was happening. 
     
      
    11 The deceased had continued walking along Beaumont Street but at some point stopped diagonally opposite where the offender and George were arguing, this no doubt having attracted her attention. The offender noticed her and began yelling abuse in her direction. She then walked across the road towards the deceased still yelling at her. The deceased commenced to yell abuse back at the offender. 
     
      
    12 The offender was carrying a bag swung over her shoulder. In that bag she was carrying a folding knife with a 10 cm blade. The knife could be opened to expose the blade by pressing a button. It could only be closed by using both hands. As the offender crossed Beaumont Street, a witness sitting in a car parked directly in front of her path, was watching her concerned that she might come to his vehicle. The deceased was further down the car park to the left-hand side of the witness. The witness gave evidence that, as the offender crossed Beaumont Street, she had her bag in front of her and was reaching inside it, apparently trying to take hold of something. Although the offender denied in her evidence touching the knife before she confronted the deceased, I have no doubt that she did. It is more than likely that she opened it at this time, or, if it was already opened, she placed it into her hand inside the bag. 
     
      
    13 The offender walked up to the deceased and the argument continued for a short time. There was a witness a short distance away watching what was happening. He had been following the activity of the deceased and the offender from the time the deceased entered into Beaumont Street. In my opinion he was a completely reliable witness and I accept his account of the stabbing beyond reasonable doubt. He described the deceased starting a physical attack upon the offender with “roundhouse type overhead punches” coming down upon the offender. The offender seemed at first to put her hands up to defend herself. However during the short confrontation between the two, there were a few punches thrown by the offender in an “uppercut style”. When they both stopped throwing punches, the deceased seemed to be hunched over the offender, who removed herself from underneath the deceased and spun away from her. The deceased then stood up, took two or three steps backwards and fell flat on her back. 
     
      
    14 I have no doubt that the uppercut style punches described by the witness were the offender stabbing at the deceased with the knife. They are consistent with the evidence that damage to the deceased’s coat indicated that there was more than one stab towards the deceased although only one made contact with her body. The description is also consistent with the stab wound inflicted to the side and under the deceased’s breast. I have no doubt that the offender had the knife in her hand either as she approached the deceased or very shortly after she confronted her. In any event I am satisfied that, as she crossed the road, the offender was aware that she would probably use the knife during the confrontation with the deceased. 
     
      
    15 Having stabbed the deceased, and knowing that she had done so, the offender met up with George and they went their way eventually ending up in a hotel playing gaming machines. At some stage the offender closed the knife and replaced it in her bag where police found it later. The jury was played a video recording of the offender after her arrest when she was speaking with the custody officer at the police station. There is at that stage no suggestion in her manner of any contrition for having stabbed the deceased. It is only when she is informed of the death of the deceased that any sign of remorse occurs and there is a very significant change in the offender’s demeanour thereafter. This is the principal matter that raises a doubt in my mind that the offender intended to kill the deceased. 
     
      
    16 However a finding in her favour that she only intended to inflict grievous bodily harm does not greatly diminish the seriousness of her conduct given the type of weapon used, her preparedness to use it and the nature of the wound inflicted upon the deceased. Even though there was only a single wound, it was in the place most likely to cause a very serious injury indeed. I have no doubt that generally the offender was the aggressor in her relationship with the deceased after it turned sour and was certainly so on this particular evening. There was not the slightest provocation by the deceased either immediately before the offender crossed the road or in the period leading up to the stabbing. The offender had the knife with her principally for her protection in carrying out her trade as a drug supplier. I am not persuaded that she went across to confront the deceased in order to stab her. But as I have already noted, she got the knife ready as she crossed the road in case she needed to use it, and not merely by way of self-defence. 
     
      
    17 The use of the knife is an aggravating factor but the only one. Although the offender had been threatening to stab the deceased, this was a chance meeting on this particular evening. She seems to have been egged on to cross the road by George who was seen to push her in that direction. It was also a contributing factor that she had been arguing with George and was in an aggressive mood before she saw the deceased. Although the offender gave evidence at the trial of using drugs during that day, there was no evidence from her as to the effect of those drugs upon her. There is no suggestion in the police video that any drugs she had taken earlier were affecting her. However, I think that there is some merit in the submission put to me on her behalf that her rather chaotic drug-affected lifestyle might have contributed to her excessive anger toward the deceased over this period of time. 
     
      
    18 The offender has a criminal record but not such that it is a matter of aggravation. However, she has an offence for violence in Queensland that resulted in her serving a sentence of imprisonment in that State. She breached parole in respect of that sentence by coming to New South Wales and using drugs. She was returned to custody in Queensland and served about two years gaol in total. She was released from custody in December 2002. Since that time she has only been convicted of a traffic offence. However, she was not of good character because she was involved in using and supplying drugs. None of this is particularly relevant to the sentence that I am to impose except that the conviction in Queensland deprives her of any leniency that she might have received had this been her first offence of violence. 
     
      
    19 There is little in mitigation of the objective seriousness of the offence except that it was not planned in any way and arose more or less instantaneously when the offender saw the deceased while she was in an aggressive state of mind because of her argument with her partner. 
     
      
    20 Turning to subjective matters I was asked to find that she is unlikely to commit further offences and that her prospects for rehabilitation are good. Those matters have little relevance to my task here. The offender must serve a very lengthy term in custody and, although she has shown signs of seeking to address her drug and other problems while in prison, it will be so long before she is released that it is speculation to try to determine what her prospects are. I have also been asked to take into account her remorse for the death of the deceased. There is undoubtedly evidence of that fact notwithstanding that she did not plead guilty to the offence and tried to minimise her criminal responsibility for the death of the deceased in the witness box. Her remorse is of only little significance, but it indicates that she is unlikely to act in the same way again and, therefore, personal deterrence is not a relevant factor. 
     
      
    21 There is little in her background that assists her. At one time she developed a heroin addiction and participated in a course of methadone to overcome it. But her primary drug of abuse has been amphetamine. This is principally the drug that she was using and supplying up until her arrest. It seems that she had a happy and uneventful life until her marriage of eight years broke up when she was aged 28. She has two daughters in their twenties from that relationship. She then entered into a relationship with a heroin addict who was violent toward her. It was during this relationship that she started using drugs. She has a child aged 13 from that relationship who lives in Queensland. The offender still maintains regular contact with her children. She was in a relationship with George Regan for about 12 months and he was a heroin user. She has not seen or heard from him since her arrest. She is close to her mother and has regular contact with her. 
     
      
    22 There are in evidence reports from a psychiatrist and a psychologist but they disclose little of relevance to the sentencing of the offender apart from setting out her background. She has no mental health problems and she was found to be in the Superior range of intelligence. Her major social problem has been her use of drugs and periods of depression. She has some medical problems but none that could impact upon the sentence to be imposed upon her. There is no suggestion that at the present time or in the foreseeable future these problems would cause prison to be more difficult for her. There is however a 30 per cent chance that she might ultimately have multiple sclerosis and she has been examined as a result of a period of loss of feeling in her right hand. Her symptoms, however, have substantially subsided over time. 
     
      
    23 Since her arrest she has become drug free. She has completed a “Getting SMART Program”, a twelve-week programme on drug abuse and life skills. She has also attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings. She has spent the period of her remand in protective custody because of fears of retribution from friends or associates of the deceased. This causes her some restriction in the amenities she can enjoy and the activities and courses available to her. However, she works as a sweeper, a trusted position in the gaol. 
     
      
    24 In my view the offence is slightly less than mid range seriousness objectively. It was a single stab wound, although as I have noted one likely to cause very serious injury if not death. It was not a planned offence and arose as a result of a chance meeting with the deceased when the offender was in an aggressive mood. The weapon was one very likely by its nature to inflict a serious wound and, as I have indicated, the offender was prepared to use it when she approached the deceased. There was no provocation on the part of the deceased. There is nothing in s 21A that would move the offence from where it lies by reason of its objective seriousness. 
     
      
    25 Nor is there anything in the subjective circumstances of the offender that moves the non-parole period up or down except the fact that she will serve the sentence probably in protection. But this is of limited significance in this particular case bearing in mind the actual nature of her custody. There are no special circumstances because the sentence will be of such length that the statutory relationship between the overall term and the non-parole period provided by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 will be adequate to address any need the offender might have for assistance on her release. There is no reason that I can see for reducing the non-parole period. 
     
      
    26 There has been placed before me a victim impact statement from the mother of the deceased. The Crown informed me that the writer was aware that the contents of the statement could not be used by me to increase the sentence upon the offender by reason of the pain and loss occasioned to the writer or the deceased’s daughter by the killing. However, the document is important because it allows the deceased’s mother to express her grief to this Court as representing the community. The offender’s act is a crime against the community and not just those who mourn the passing of the deceased. The punishment meted out by the Court on the offender is for what she has done to the community and to express on its behalf its abhorrence of the taking of human life whoever the victim might be but also to express its sympathy and compassion for the deceased’s mother and her daughter. 
     
      
    27 I have been referred to a schedule of sentences imposed upon offenders after trial where the standard non-parole period provisions apply. These represent a guide but of course they each depend upon their own particular facts and circumstances. However I have taken them into account and I believe the sentence that I am about to impose upon the offender is broadly consistent with those sentences. I believe I should indicate that the sentence I am about to impose is longer than the sentence I would have imposed had there been no standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    28 The offender is convicted. She is sentenced to a non-parole period of 16 years 6 months with a balance of term of 5 years 6 months. The sentence is to commence from 19 June 2005 and the non-parole period expires on 18 December 2021 the date upon which the offender is eligible to be released to parole. The balance of term commences on 19 December 2021 and expires on 18 June 2027.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: Mr Dailly of Senior Counsel has put the appellant’s case well. I am nevertheless of the view that the jury’s verdict must stand. 
     
      
    2 This is a sad case for the victims and the appellant and for their respective families. The role of this Court is to determine the matter in accordance with the law and our function as an appellate court. 
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against his conviction on four counts of dangerous driving, three causing death and one causing grievous bodily harm. The accident in question occurred on 5 March 2004 on the Pacific Highway near Bulahdelah. It was daylight. Conditions were fine and the road was dry.  
     
      
    4 The appellant was driving a Volvo prime mover towing a trailer laden with steel pipes. He was going at about 90 kilometres per hour, the speed limit being 100 kilometres per hour. He was travelling south along a straight stretch of several hundred metres. There was a single marked lane approximately 3.6 metres wide bordered with a white fog or edge line, with a three metre wide bitumen breakdown lane on the left or eastern side. There was a fair amount of traffic. 
     
      
    5 The Crown case accepted by the jury was that the appellant was inattentive to his driving.  
     
      
    6 The defence case advanced in a record of interview and the appellant’s sworn testimony was that just before the appellant’s vehicle hit the Toyota Hilux ahead of him, something caused the appellant’s windscreen to shatter or craze so that he could not see through it. This assertion was challenged by the prosecution on several bases. The primary Crown case throughout was that the Volvo’s windscreen only shattered in the ensuing accident. The prosecution also contended that if the shattering preceded impact, the accident would still have occurred because of the appellant’s previous inattention. 
     
      
    7 The case went to the jury on the basis that they could convict on either factual hypothesis so long as the jury was satisfied that the manner of driving causative of death or grievous bodily harm was dangerous. The judge told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        The manner of driving, members of the jury, includes all matters connected with the management and control of the vehicle when it is being driven, but there is an important distinction to be drawn between mere negligence and driving in a manner which is dangerous. For an episode of driving to be classed as dangerous there must be some serious breach of the proper conduct of a vehicle on the roadway; so serious as to be in reality and not just a matter of speculation, potentially dangerous to another person or persons. The Crown does not have to establish that the accused knew, or realised, that he was driving dangerously. The test is an objective one. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    8 Mr Kevin Gooch was travelling southwards in front of the appellant driving a Toyota Hilux four wheel drive. His passengers were his father, Don Gooch, and his nephew, Luke Styles. Keels Road is a small, unsealed road that intersects with the highway on the west. Mr Gooch slowed and stopped, waiting to turn right into Keels Road when the northbound traffic would permit it. His indicator was on and he stopped close to the centre of the road. His car was almost 1.7 metres wide. Before he came to a stop, a vehicle later identified as a Land Rover Discovery that had come up behind him passed him on the left-hand side using the breakdown lane. That Discovery was immediately ahead of the appellant. 
     
      
    9 Mr Kevin Gooch said that a few seconds after the vehicle had gone past on the left side, he glanced in the mirror and saw a semitrailer coming behind. He estimated it to be about 100 metres or more back. He pumped his foot on the brake two or three times to indicate that he had stopped, waiting to make what to him was a familiar right-hand turn. Luke Styles, who was sitting behind him, looked back and saw the semitrailer approaching, not slowing down or deviating. He looked again to the front and again to the back. He told his uncle that “this fellow’s not moving over...he’s not slowing down” or words to that effect. 
     
      
    10 The appellant did not observe the vehicle that passed Mr Gooch on his left, nor did he see the blinkers or brake lights on the Gooch vehicle. His semitrailer crashed into the nearside rear of the Hilux, pushing it into the path of a northbound Toyota Landcruiser, colliding head on. This was the car in which Mr Wood was a passenger. He is the man whose serious and permanent injuries were the subject of the count involving grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    11 It is common ground that following the collision with the Hilux, the appellant lost the ability to steer and from that point onwards the truck was out of control. 
     
      
    12 The appellant’s vehicle continued in a southerly direction, crossing to the incorrect side of the highway before colliding with two northbound vehicles. One was a Hyundai Excel driven by Mrs Barbara Cheadle, with her granddaughters Rebecca and Jessica Campbell as passengers. All three members of the family died instantly from the impact. 
     
      
    13 Shortly after coming to rest, the Hyundai Excel burst into flames, engulfing both vehicles. The appellant’s prime mover was extensively damaged. By this stage its windscreen was knocked completely out, although it was not scientifically possible to prove whether this occurred before, at or after the impact with the Hilux. 
     
      
    14 At a speed of 90 kph, the appellant’s vehicle would have been travelling at twenty-five metres per second before braking. The appellant said in evidence that he usually maintained a space of forty to fifty metres between his vehicle and the one in front. 
     
      
    15 The appellant’s vehicle was almost 2.5 metres wide. There was therefore room for it to have passed the Hilux on its left, as the Discovery had done, had the appellant reacted in time to do so. There was in fact considerable evidence showing that that did not occur because the appellant failed to observe the Discovery diverting to the left or the stationary Hilux with its blinker on. The appellant accepted that he did not see the stationary Hilux both in his record of interview and his sworn evidence (see the Transcript of ERISP, Q & A 128, and Transcript 1, June 2006, p37). 
     
      
    16 Sergeant Dawson of the Newcastle Crash Investigation Unit attended the accident site and gave evidence of his observations as well as some evidence of an expert nature. Sergeant Dawson observed gouge marks obviously caused as the Volvo struck the back of the Hilux. He examined immediately to the north looking for tyre lockup marks, brake marks or any other gouge marks, or anything that might lead him to believe something happened prior to the initial point of impact, but he found nothing (Transcript, 31 May 2006, p52). Sergeant Dawson also found evidence corroborating that the Gooch vehicle had its indicators on prior to the accident. 
     
      
    17 In the company of his solicitor the appellant was formally interviewed by the police on 20 April 2004. Early in the interview the solicitor presented a prepared witness statement of his client. In it the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        I was driving along when suddenly I was unable to see in front of me as the windscreen shattered. I do not recall how or why the windscreen shattered. I believe, although I am not able to say with certainty, I lightly applied the brakes. I then heard and felt an impact at the front of my vehicle. After this I did not have control of the vehicle. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    18 Asked in the interview whether he knew what may have caused the windscreen to shatter on the day, the appellant said that it could be two things, “could be a stone from the road, could be someone threw something at the windscreen”. The appellant said that he did not see anyone around. (Neither did the witness Gooch, the driver of the stationary Hilux.) The appellant said in the record of interview that because the glass was shattered into little bits he could not see through the windscreen (Q & A, 77-81). 
     
      
    19 In his evidence at trial the appellant said he was travelling about forty to fifty metres behind the car in front. He did not notice any car in front with an indicator or blinker light on. As he was driving, the “windscreen went all white, shattering and all white” (Transcript, 1 June 2006, p39). He did not hear any noise beforehand or see anything strike the windscreen. The transcript records him saying that he “proached (as said) the brakes” and the next thing he heard and felt was a bang. 
     
      
    20 The shattered windscreen explanation was challenged by the prosecution at several levels. It was put to the appellant in cross-examination that the accident occurred because he was not paying attention and that the windscreen broke when the semitrailer hit the Hilux. 
     
      
    21 The prosecution also relied upon the evidence of Mr Gooch and his nephew as to the significant distance the Volvo was back from the Hilux when they saw it as it bore down upon them. The Crown submitted that the appellant had time to slow down and space to go around the stationary Hilux. The absence of skid marks from the semitrailer were also difficult to reconcile with the appellant’s version of events. At the very least it indicates that the appellant was virtually on top of the Hilux when, if his evidence is true, the windscreen shattered. As indicated, the Crown case was that the offences were also proved on this alternative hypothesis. 
     
      
    22 The Crown case also addressed the windscreen scenario head on. It was proved that the Volvo was manufactured in September 1992 and purchased by Heggies Bulk Haul in October of that year. The prime mover was sold to the appellant in May 1996. The appellant swore that he never replaced the windscreen while the truck was in his ownership. The Volvo also had a stone guard on its front up to about ten to twelve inches below the appellant’s eye level.  
     
      
    23 The Crown could not prove that the windscreen was not changed during the Heggies era. According to the appellant, the vehicle had about 300,000 kms “and something” on the clock when he bought it. It had previously been a coal truck. Mr Adams, the national product support manager from Volvo Commercial Vehicles, said that it was his experience that it was “a regular feature of the trucking industry that windscreens [were] replaced because of stone chips” (Transcript, 31 May 2006, p22). He opined that he doubted that a vehicle could be twelve to thirteen years old and still have its original windscreen. He was, of course, talking of the whole period from manufacture to accident. As indicated, the appellant owned the car for the greater part of that time and he had not replaced the windscreen. 
     
      
    24 Mr Adams also gave evidence that it was Volvo’s choice at the relevant time to follow the European standard and fit laminated windscreens at the time of manufacture. A representative of O’Brien’s Glass Industries gave evidence that if a laminated windscreen was struck by an object it would show a circular pattern, concentric circles coming out from the point where the object struck the glass, with lines running out from that point. In other words, it would not have shattered in a way that behaved in the manner described by the appellant or that would have completely blinded the driver. 
     
      
    25 The Crown case went to the jury on the basis of showing that the appellant failed to keep a proper lookout. But it was also put in the alternative that if the jury found it was reasonably possible that the windscreen broke only a very short time before the impact with the rear of the Hilux, that still did not explain why on a clear day with clear visibility on a flat, straight stretch of the highway, while the appellant was sitting in an elevated position, the appellant failed to see what was happening in front of him. 
     
      
    26 Senior Counsel for the appellant, who also represented him at trial, submitted to us that one and a half to two seconds perception and reaction time would be expected before an alert driver could be expected to brake in response to some stimulus. He also submitted that allowance should be made for the fact that the Discovery vehicle was between the appellant’s semitrailer and the Hilux, thereby masking the Hilux’s flashing indicator, at least until the Discovery deviated to the left.  
     
      
    27 If the appellant was travelling at about fifty metres behind the car in front, this would have left little or no margin for error, even for a driver responding to a car ahead moving at his or her pace suddenly stopping or slowing. That would suggest room for caution about endorsing either the accuracy or the safeness of the appellant’s asserted spacing of fifty metres as his driving practice.  
     
      
    28 Furthermore, the submission does not really allow for the opportunity the appellant had to react to the sight of the Discovery passing on the left in the breakdown lane, nor to the evidence of Mr Gooch and Mr Styles about them having clear vision of the approaching semitrailer from approximately 100 metres back. There is also the evidence of Mr Gooch pumping the brakes of the Hilux to attract the semitrailer’s attention. 
     
      
    29 These matters show that the period of inattention was well capable of being found to be more than momentary, if I may borrow from sentencing law parlance. When sentencing, the learned judge said he was satisfied that the inattention for whatever reason spanned at least some seconds. I agree that such conclusion was well open to the jury also. Given the circumstances of a heavily laden semitrailer travelling a 90 kph down a busy highway, the jury were in my view well entitled to find the case proved to the requisite standard. 
     
      
    30 The appellant makes no complaint as to the summing up. His sole ground of appeal on conviction is that it was not open to the jury acting reasonably to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The legal principles are not in dispute, see M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493. The task of this Court is to review the whole of the record of the trial, making its own independent assessment of the evidence in determining whether, making due allowance for the natural limitations that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty (Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300). 
     
      
    31 The Crown had to show in this case that the appellant was guilty of more than want of due care. In the circumstances it had to be established that he drove “in a manner dangerous to another person or persons ” (Crimes Act 1900, s52A 1(c)). The test is objective and inattention is of itself no defence.  
     
      
    32 The appellant submits that the Crown case was circumstantial and that guilt could only be inferred when no other reasonable explanation could be drawn. It is also submitted that the evidence established that it was at least a reasonable possibility that the appellant’s windscreen shattered before the collision with the Hilux, thereby effectively blinding him. It is further submitted that there was no credible evidence to suggest that this occurred at a time when it had no relevant impact on the cause of the collision. 
     
      
    33 I cannot accept any of these propositions. Given the totality of the Crown evidence, the jury were entitled to reject the entire account of the windscreen that shattered before impact. What is important in this Court is whether the jury were entitled to reach that verdict. We are not permitted to form our own opinion on the matter other than in the context of the principles in Weiss’ Case that I have already stated.  
     
      
    34 My understanding of the principles relating to challenging a conviction on the ground that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable is that the appellant must persuade the appellate court that it was not open to the jury acting reasonably to arrive at their verdict. If one path to a conviction is open and beyond successful attack by reference to this standard, then an appellant who cannot disentangle the jury’s verdict is unable to sustain the burden of displacing that verdict. In any event, the jury was in my view equally entitled to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that even if the appellant was possibly to be believed on the matter of the shattered windscreen, dangerous driving causative of death and grievous bodily harm were still established. The summation of the evidence that I have already given explains my basic reasoning as to these propositions. 
     
      
    35 The appellant is entitled to have this Court weigh, as did the jury, his practically unchallenged evidence about the background of the accident. The appellant was aged sixty-seven at the time, a truck driver with forty-four years experience. He had driven all the way from Brisbane to the accident scene but had had appropriate rest stops on the way. It is not suggested that he had consumed alcohol or drugs, and there was no evidence of any specific event that diverted his attention. Indeed, there was the appellant’s sworn evidence to the contrary. 
     
      
    36 The appellant also swore that he gave his version of the accident to Luke Styles when he saw him at hospital on the day of the accident. Mr Styles said that the appellant told him words to the effect of “sorry ... couldn’t see the windscreen. I couldn’t see anything, I just seen something big” (Transcript, 29 May 2006, p31). Mr Styles would not agree that the words used were that the appellant could not see through the windscreen. To my mind, this particular evidence is inconclusive given the uncertainty as to what was said. Furthermore, the appellant’s version of the conversation rises no higher than showing the consistency of his version of events from the day of the accident onwards. The weight of the evidence still depends upon his credibility as a witness. 
     
      
    37 This was not a case where the jury were bound to accept the appellant’s sworn evidence. To put it at its lowest, there was a good deal of material to the contrary.  
     
      
    38 The appellant places some weight on the evidence of Mr Husband, who was driving a Freightliner truck immediately behind him. Mr Husband said that he saw the appellant’s brake lights “flicker, come on, next minute I saw the semitrailer go up in the air”. In-chief he estimated the time gap between the brakes flashing and the cab going up in the air at about three seconds. 
     
      
    39 The trial took place in May-June 2006. Having obtained leave to cross-examine on a prior inconsistent statement, the prosecutor put to Mr Husband that in a statement of 10 May 2004 he had said “I couldn’t see anything in front of the truck. The next thing I saw was the brake lights flash on the trailer and it would not have been more than a split second before I saw the cabin of the truck get airborne.” Mr Husband agreed that his recollection of events would have been better than it was when he was giving evidence at trial and that it was just a split second as distinct from a three second time gap. Time estimates by lay witnesses, of course, always need to be viewed cautiously, but this observation cuts both ways on the facts of this case. 
     
      
    40 At the end of the day I do not think that Mr Husband’s evidence assists the appellant in showing that it was not open to the jury to find guilt beyond reasonable doubt. If the appellant had put the brakes down heavily before impact there would probably have been marks to show it. If he did not, then a range of hypotheses are open. Some may assist the appellant, some do not.  
     
      
    41 The appellant suggests that Mr Husband’s evidence corroborates his version in that it suggests no harsh braking and no swerving. It seems to me that while this evidence is consistent with the appellant virtually running into the back of the Hilux without attempting to stop, such a proposition provides no positive support for the hypothesis that the appellant was blinded by a suddenly shattered windscreen. Taken by itself, it equally supports the hypothesis that the appellant did not appreciate that the Hilux was stopped until it was too late. 
     
      
    42 Road resurfacing work had been carried out by the RTA in the area just to the south of the accident on 9-10 February 2004. During this period the speed limit was 80 kph. Line marking occurred on 18 February and the 100 kph speed limit was restored at that time. There was evidence that the RTA practice was for a vacuum broom to sweep the entire area twice on the day of the seal. However, a sign stating “Beware windscreen damage, loose stones” was then erected and it was still in place on the day of the accident, 5 March 2004. An officer of the RTA agreed that bits of aggregate could nevertheless remain beyond the trafficable carriageway, ie to the side of the road. He was speaking about the area outside of the sealed breakdown lane. Of course, it is possible that stones could have been thrown back onto that sealed breakdown lane in the ensuing period. 
     
      
    43 In my view, this evidence is somewhat equivocal on the ultimate issue. Either alone or in conjunction with the other evidence it certainly does not establish that the verdict was unreasonable in the relevant sense.  
     
      
    44 I would therefore conclude that the challenge to the jury’s verdict has not shown a basis for this Court overturning it and that the appeal against conviction must be dismissed. 
     
      
    45 The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences that were imposed upon him. Coolahan DCJ imposed an effective sentence of three years three months with a non-parole period of fifteen months. The formal sentences imposed on 5 October 2006 were: 
     
      
       
        
        On count 1 he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for four months to commence today and expire on 4 February 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        On count 3 he is sentenced to a non parole period of eight months imprisonment to commence on 5 January 2007 and expire on 4 September 2007. I fix a full term of two years and six months to expire on 4 July 2009. 
        
       
       
        
        On count 4 he is sentenced to a non parole period of eight months imprisonment to commence on 5 April 2007 and expire on 4 December 2007. I fix a full term of two years and six months to expire on 4 October 2009. 
        
       
       
        
        On count 2 he is sentenced to a non parole period of six months imprisonment to commence on 5 July 2007 and expire on 4 January 2008. I fix a full term of two years and six months to expire on 4 January 2010. 
        
       
       
        
        I direct that the offender be eligible for release to parole on 4 January 2008. 
        
       
       
      
    46 The trial judge also disqualified Mr Morabito for eighteen months from driving. 
     
      
    47 His Honour provides detailed and careful reasoning for what he described as an extremely difficult sentencing exercise. For the count involving grievous bodily harm the maximum term of imprisonment was seven years. For each of the counts involving death it was ten years. His Honour correctly observed that the crimes were not ones requiring proof of any intent such as recklessness, and that the multiple impacts upon the four victims and their families were to be taken into account. 
     
      
    48 There was a body of medical and other evidence that required the appellant’s subjective case to be viewed as a very powerful one. His Honour noted a number of factors in his favour in that regard. There was nothing untoward in the appellant’s driving in the period before the accident. He was taking a load from Brisbane to Tasmania but had had appropriate rest stops on the way to Bulahdelah. It was not alleged that he was fatigued or suffering from the effects of alcohol or drugs. The appellant, who was sixty-seven at the time, had given up truck driving in consequence of the accident. He was diagnosed as suffering clinical depression with several symptoms. Evidence that has been put before this Court indicates that his medical condition is still sadly a serious one. That evidence can only be used by this Court if it came to re-sentence having first found error on the part of the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    49 The appellant had been a truck driver for forty-four years. There were a large number of speeding offences over the years but nothing involving any traffic offences like the dangerous driving or the like. The appellant had never previously been in custody. He is the father of a close family unit. He is held in high regard by many members of the community. The learned sentencing judge had no doubt that the appellant’s expressions of remorse were entirely genuine. 
     
      
    50 It was common ground that the sentencing exercise had to take account of the guideline judgements in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. It was therefore incumbent upon the judge to form his own opinion consistent with the jury’s verdicts as to the level of moral culpability involved having regard to all the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    51 Coolahan DCJ characterised the Crown case as accepted by the jury as being: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [T]hat had he been paying proper attention to [t]his driving he would have seen the indicator on Mr Gooch’s vehicle, would have noticed that vehicle slowing down, would have observed the four wheel drive overtaking Mr Gooch’s vehicle on the inside and would have, therefore been in a position to do likewise or to himself slow down and stop before a collision occurred. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    52 His Honour thought that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [I]t would be unrealistic to try to resolve the factual issues in this case on the basis of calculations as to speed and distance and the like. That is not to say that they are entirely irrelevant, but the reality is that the Crown case, as squarely put to the jury, was that even if the jury accepted that the windscreen of the truck broke and that the vision of the offender was impaired that this happened at such a time either when his vehicle impacted with the Hilux or so soon before that the offender’s prior inattention had put him in a position where it would not have mattered whether the windscreen broke or not. As I said earlier, the jury in my view clearly accepted this argument. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    53 The judge concluded: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In my view, the jury’s verdicts must lead to the conclusion that the offender was guilty of more than just momentary attention in the strict sense. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his inattention, for whatever reason, spanned at least some seconds. It is impossible to say for how long his attention was diverted from his driving, or why, but the reality is that whilst it may have been only for some seconds it was sufficient to place him in a situation where he could not avoid a collision which was otherwise, in my view, entirely avoidable.  
         
         
        An onerous duty is cast upon the drivers of heavy vehicles on the highway. The potential for gross harm resulting from even momentary inattention is obvious. When a heavy vehicle travelling at speed, albeit within the legal limit, is involved in a collision common sense and experience dictates that the chances of very significant harm resulting there from are much more likely than if the collision had been between normal motor vehicles travelling at slower speeds. This case clearly demonstrates the realisation of the potential for such harm in such a catastrophic and tragic way. For these reasons, it seems to me that even given that the offender’s level of inattention leading to the accident was perhaps not much more than momentary, when one takes into account the vehicle he was driving and the circumstances thereunder combined with the catastrophic and tragic results, the only possible sentences are full time custodial sentences. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    54 His Honour nevertheless held that the offender’s moral culpability was towards the lower end of the scale of seriousness. Later in his remarks on sentence the judge said that: 
     
      
       
        
        [W]hilst I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s inattention was more than strictly momentary I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it went anywhere near constituting a complete abandonment of responsibility. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    55 The aggregate sentences imposed for the four offences definitely reflect such a conclusion. They also pay regard, in my view appropriate regard, to the finding of special circumstances based on the offender’s age, his ill health stemming from his realisation of the accident’s consequences, and the fact that this would be his first time in custody. 
     
      
    56 Two related grounds of appeal are raised as to sentence. They are  
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour erred in sentencing the appellant on the basis that his culpability was more than “momentary inattention”. 
        
       
       
        
        2. In all of the circumstances the overall sentence of 3 years 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      
    57 I would reject the submission that the jury were invited to find guilt on the basis of “momentary inattention” or that they did so. Isolated remarks in the address of prosecuting counsel cannot be taken out of context nor can they substitute for the trial judge’s directions to the jury, let alone his findings in the remarks on sentence. I have already addressed the sole ground of appeal raised as to conviction. I also observe that his Honour made the critical findings as to sentence on the basis of his own satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    58 It is true that the inattention established is not shown to be more than a few seconds in duration. But this was a busy highway. The appellant was driving a large heavy vehicle at 90 kph and, on his own admission, he failed to observe either the Discovery vehicle that passed the Hilux on its left or the Hilux itself with its indicators flashing and brake lights being pumped by Mr Gooch. 
     
      
    59 Other parts of the appellant’s submissions on sentence in this court appear to be re-agitating the reasonableness of the jury’s verdict, and I have already addressed that matter in a different context. 
     
      
    60 As with the challenge to the verdicts, the appellant presents various scenarios and calculations as to reaction times, distances and sight lines. Drivers’ estimates of distance, time and speed are frequently unreliable. A jury’s capacity and a sentencing judge’s capacity to form sustainable conclusions as to guilt and the level of moral responsibility in the circumstances, and to do so according to the criminal standard, do not depend upon such mathematical niceties. In some cases they may, but this is not one of them.  
     
      
    61 I can detect no error in the sentencing judge’s careful analysis of the factual material or his ultimate judgment call as to the sentence. I agree with the passages in the remarks on sentence that I have quoted above.  
     
      
    62 This Court’s role is not to re-sentence but to determine whether the sentencing judge erred. In my view he did not. I propose that on the sentencing matter there be leave to appeal against sentence but that that appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    63 HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by the President and with his Honour’s reasons.64 ROTHMAN J: I agree with the reasons of his Honour the President and the orders he proposed.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Jessica McGaw appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty, on an earlier occasion, to an offence of, whilst in company with a number of other people, inciting a man, who I will refer to by the initials DS, to commit an act of indecency with her, at the time DS being sixteen years of age.2 The maximum penalty for that offence is, perhaps surprisingly, only three years. Although I am surprised at the maximum penalty which applies for that sort of offence I will of course not allow those feelings to influence the sentence I will shortly announce on Ms McGaw. The maximum penalty is of course reserved for those cases which fall into the worst case, and this is not such a case. It is however, as my sentence will demonstrate, a very serious example of criminal conduct.3 On 2 August 2005 a large group of young people met up at the Mt Druitt shops. At this time DS walked past and began talking to them. He lived nearby, having recently moved to the location from Western Australia. Things were amicable and DS was invited to go to a nearby unit to have a drink with members of the group. They all went to an address in Mt Druitt. Later on that evening the offender, DS, and another man walked to Westfields to get some more alcohol. They then came back to the premises and continued drinking.4 At one stage DS was sitting on a kitchen chair within the lounge room. For reasons which I fail to understand one of the group, a man by the name of Dickson, became aggressive and without warning hit DS with a closed fist to his face. He fell to the ground. He got up, but was pushed down again. Mr Dickson continued to assault DS, kicking and punching into him, again hitting him in the head. Not surprisingly, DS started to cry. Rather than those who were also in the premises assisting DS, two of them joined in, LK and the offender’s brother, Gavin. They too punched and kicked DS whilst he was on the ground. Not surprisingly he suffered a number of injuries as a result of those assaults. One of the members of the group left the premises, but then DS was assaulted once more.5 These assaults occurred in the presence of the offender. She was no part of them. She is not to be sentenced as though she were in any way an accessory to those assaults or criminally responsible for them. But they are important because they put what later occurred in context. After these two separate assaults on DS, and after he had suffered a number of injuries, Ms McGaw decided to inflict an indignity upon DS. She pulled her pants down and told DS to kiss her on her vagina while she had her underpants on. DS said he did not want to, but the offender insisted.6 At the time this occurred there were three other young men and another young woman present in the room. DS was forced to kiss the offender on the outside of her underpants in the area of her vagina. Ms McGaw was laughing while this occurred. At some stage after this Ms McGaw left the premises.7 I know from two sources about what happened to DS after Ms McGaw left. Again she is not criminally responsible for the most serious assaults which were committed upon DS after the offender had left the premises. But they are nevertheless relevant, primarily, because the offender has agreed to give evidence for the crown against a number of the people who were involved in the later assaults.8 I recited what occurred to DS after the offender left when I sentenced her brother, Gavin McGaw, on 22 February 2007. For the purposes of these remarks it is enough to note that he was subject to serious violence, serious indignity, and was treated as though he was inhuman, with no thought being given to his welfare by those involved. The offences committed upon him after the offender left were very serious indeed. In the event that any of those involved in those later assaults is convicted lengthy sentences will no doubt be imposed.9 Police inquiries led to them believing that the offender was involved. Before she could be picked up by police however she voluntarily went to the Penrith police station. She was arrested and interviewed. She did not tell the complete truth in that interview. In particular, she denied that DS had been forced to kiss her on the outside of her underpants. She also said some other things that were not true, which will diminish her credibility when she later gives evidence for the crown. The offender was denied bail and has spent two months and thirteen days in custody. She was released on bail and has spent some time on bail pending today’s sentencing date.10 The offender was nineteen years age at the time of the offence. She has had a very volatile upbringing. Mr Paish described her as a ping pong ball, bouncing between her parents, who are separated, and both of whom have serious drug and alcohol issues. As a result Ms McGaw has become friendly with the family of her ex-partner and they appear to have acted as a substitute family.11 Ms McGaw was, at the time that a pre-sentence report was prepared, and certainly at the time of the offence, a serious drinker. She told the author of the probation and parole report that she had consumed about twelve beers before the offence occurred. She said that she commenced drinking alcohol when she was about sixteen and that her consumption had escalated until her social activities centred around alcohol. At the time of the offence Ms McGaw said that she was drinking both daily and heavily. She recognises the contribution that alcohol has had to her offending behaviour. I note in passing that there is further evidence of the offender’s problems with alcohol in the form of a conviction for a PCA matter. The offence occurred before this offence and she was sentenced for it afterwards.12 The offender has, despite leaving school at year 9, and despite having problems with alcohol, been able to work. For about two years she was employed as a casual cleaner, her employer describing her as a reliable good worker. She lost that job when she was unable to tell her employer whether she would be able to attend for work because she had been subpoenaed to give evidence for the crown in trials relating to other alleged offenders. It is not her fault therefore that she has lost the job. The fact that she has been able to work and keep a job and be described as a reliable good worker is an important matter when I come to assess her prospects of rehabilitation. I am satisfied that they are good.13 The question as to whether she is remorseful is related to whether she is likely to rehabilitate herself. There was no evidence put before me that the offender was remorseful, apart from a reference to it in a probation and parole report, and even that suggested that although she was embarrassed and regretful for her behaviour she did not volunteer remorse. It may well be that the offender does not even now appreciate the seriousness of her misconduct. She will understand how serious the courts treat the matter after she is sentenced by me. 14 The crown put before me a Victim Impact Statement prepared by DS. I do not understand why objection was not taken to it, because it is, if objection had been taken, inadmissible. It must be remembered that DS was subject to horrific indignant sexual assaults for which Ms McGaw is not being sentenced. Clearly no-one could separate out from the effects that DS has suffered, those that relate only to the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. DS has obviously suffered a great deal as a result of everything that occurred to him, but there is no assistance in the Victim Impact Statement as to how much of those consequences are the responsibility of the offender. In those circumstances the Victim Impact Statement is of little weight. That will, however, not effect the sentence that I impose upon the offender. Anyone forced to do what DS was forced to do in circumstances where he had already been assaulted twice and suffered injuries would experience significant consequences as a result of that offence.15 As I have mentioned the offender has undertaken to give evidence for the crown in trials which are due to commence very shortly, indeed, on 7 May this year.16 The material put before me on that issue includes reference to facts which are not in a document headed “agreed facts” also tendered to me. The material relating to the assistance provides a much more serious picture of events than that related in the agreed facts. I recall that there is authority which says that in those circumstances I cannot use the material to be found in the information relating to the assistance against the offender. I will sentence her by assessing the objective facts, as they are to be found in the statement headed agreed facts. I appreciate that this is somewhat artificial but it is something that I am required to do.’17 Also artificial is the fact that I must ignore things I learnt when I sentenced the offender’s brother. The statement of facts tendered in that case also referred to the events being much more serious, even before the offender left, than the statement of facts tendered in this case. As I explained to Mr Paish earlier that is something which sentencing judges are required to confront regularly. I repeat I will sentence the offender on the basis of the material that is before me on this occasion, not on the basis of material that was before me on an earlier occasion.18 The offender’s assistance extends beyond implicating others in what occurred before she left the premises. Her evidence will be of assistance to the crown in proving the guilt of those who are alleged to have done things to DS after she left. As I have said on many occasions in these remarks on sentence what occurred after the offender left was grave indeed. But when I come to assess the value of the offender’s assistance as I must I have to recognise that her assistance is not of the same level as it would have been if she had been present for the entirety of the events.19 When I raised this issue with Mr Paish he made some submissions to me about the relevance of the fact that the offender’s assistance is limited in that way. I will state my understanding of the law as clearly as I can so that if I am wrong then I will be seen to be wrong.20 It is not the offender’s fault that she left earlier. So she is not being punished for having done so but it remains the fact that her assistance is less than it would have been had she remained there. I consider that that is a relevant matter in assessing the discount that should be given to the offender for that assistance. When I look at s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the list of factors that I must take into account refers not only to truthfulness, completeness and reliability of information but also the usefulness of information. The offender’s assistance is not as useful as it would have been had she been able to give evidence as to what occurred after she left. Also in assessing her usefulness, taking into account her earlier false denials to police, I must recognise that her credibility will be affected by the fact that she has not been completely truthful with the authorities.21 I will not quantify the discount that I will impose for the assistance separately from the discount for the plea of guilty. I will however note that when I compare the discount for this offender with the discount I allowed for her brother’s assistance, she can provide lesser assistance than her brother could. On the other hand her plea was entered earlier than her brother’s. The offender was committed for trial in June last year, there was an offer to plead to a lesser charge than that to which the offender has ultimately pleaded in July. The matter was in this court on five or six occasions before a plea was entered. In those circumstances the discount I will allow for the plea of guilty and the assistance is thirty percent.22 I should mention the question of parity in relation to the sentences I imposed upon the offender’s brother. This particular matter for which the offender is to be sentenced has a counterpart in a matter on a Form 1 attached to one of the offences which Mr McGaw was sentenced, and I repeat that he was sentenced on the basis of different facts. Parity is really of no application in those circumstances, there being nothing really to compare the sentence I will impose on this offender with any sentence I imposed on Mr McGaw. Of course I will take into account that the offender has spent some considerable time in fulltime custody. I can say considerable time because two months and thirteen days in fulltime custody for an offender going to gaol for the first time is considerable.23 It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. This was grave conduct indeed. The offence is to be placed in it’s proper context when I assess it’s criminality. This was not a case where nothing at all had happened to DS before he was incited to kiss the outside of the offender’s vaginal area. To the contrary at the time the offender did what she did, DS has already been subject to acts of violence. He was crying at times and he was injured. This places the offender’s actions in it’s proper context and makes her behaviour serious indeed.24 Taking into account the periods of imprisonment already served I will sentence the offender to imprisonment but order that it be served by way of periodic detention. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of six months with a head sentence of twelve months. That sentence is to be served by way of periodic detention. The offender is therefore to report to the Norma Parker Periodic Detention Centre at 8.30am on 5 May 2007 in order to commence serving her sentence.

    JUDGMENT1. Thanh Dung Nguyen has pleaded guilty to supplying a prohibited drug. It was 2.1123 kilograms of heroin. This is more than twice the large commercial quantity for heroin. The offence was against s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Because it is more than a large commercial quantity, it carries a sentence of life imprisonment pursuant to s33(3)(a) of the same Act. Two backup offences have been transferred to me: possessing a prohibited drug, 2.1123 kilograms of heroin and goods in custody, the amount of $10,000. 2. The offender was committed for sentence on 6 December 2006 from the Liverpool Local Court. The Crown acknowledges that his plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity.3. The facts of the offences are set out in a document which is part of Exhibit A. On 20 August 2006, police received information about a possible interstate transportation of a large amount of illegal drugs. The information included the name of the offender and a car registration number. Police conducted surveillance on certain premises in Fairfield East and on the offender in his car. Police later approached the offender in the car and told him of their suspicions. The offender denied that he was carrying any drugs. When the police searched the car, the offender admitted there were drugs and told the police where to look. They found white packaging underneath where the spare tyre is held. The packaging was stored through the rims of the tyre and clearly depicted in a series of photographs taken at the scene. The packaging comprised seven blocks neatly and securely packaged by heavy duty tape and cushioned with carpet inserts. The packaging had clearly been carefully secured so as to avoid detection otherwise than by a thorough search. 4. The offender was arrested and cautioned. He admitted he was on his way to Melbourne to meet a friend to deliver the drugs. He said that he had packed the blocks in the tyre himself earlier that morning. He was taken to Liverpool Police Station where he participated in an electronic recorded interview. 5. During the course of the interview, the offender admitted storing the drugs in the hiding place and told the police that he would be receiving $10,000 for the delivery to Melbourne. In addition, he admitted that it was the second time he had done such a delivery. When asked why, he replied “Oh I just need the money”. He told the police that a man whom he could not identify had delivered the drugs to his place earlier that morning. Questioned about the earlier delivery of drugs he told the police that he had delivered the drugs to an Asian male whose name de did not know and was paid $10,000. That occurred about two weeks before his arrest. He said that there were on that occasion, six bags of drugs of the same size, but overall a smaller amount of the drugs. Asked how he found out about making money from the delivery of drugs, he said that he had attended a nightclub in Cabravale. He told a man that he needed money and the man told him how he could do it. That conversation occurred some six months before his arrest but the first contact was made only a couple of weeks before. The offender acknowledged that the packaging and storage of the drugs in the spare wheel was his idea. He also acknowledged that he knew that what he was delivering were drugs but that he did not know what kind of drugs. Asked why he needed the money, the offender replied “Because I got big mortgage”. He and his wife were both employed.6. The offender was born on 11 March 1965 so that he has just turned forty-two years old. He was arrested on the day of the offence, 20 August 2006 and has been in custody only on this matter since that date. He has no previous convictions nor was the offence committed while he was on any form of conditional liberty. Evidently there were eight bags of drugs. They were analysed by an analyst at the Division of Analytical Laboratories of the Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research. The total weight of the items was 2.1123 kilograms.7. There was tendered in evidence a pre-sentence report dated 8 March 2007 by Jendy Ellen, a Probation and Parole officer. Some items of history in that report were corrected from the bar table and accepted by the parties. The offender was born in Vietnam and came to Australia in 1985. He still has siblings in Vietnam. He described a troubled childhood with his family being caught up in difficult times in Vietnam. He has two children from a previous marriage. They are presently aged twenty-three and twenty-one. He has been in his current relationship for some eight years and has two children, one of them is two and the other is six months. He was described by his partner as a very supportive and caring father and partner. He told the officer that his wife’s parents came to live with them two years ago and that a year ago they all moved in with his wife’s aunt and uncle. He reported financial difficulties stemming from this arrangement. He left school at the age of eleven and has worked in a variety of areas and has been employed for the last eight years by Woolworths working in a warehouse. There was in evidence a letter from his employer noting that he had abandoned his employment and terminating that employment. He has taken advantage of education programmes in custody. He does not report any alcohol or drug problem but claims to have commenced gambling since the move to his wife’s relatives. He reported to the officer that “He needed to obtain money to cover debts relating to the mortgage on their house” and “that he was responsible for supporting the family unit and was struggling to meet his financial commitments”. He was reported as appearing regretful and acknowledging the seriousness of his actions. The officer described his “presenting issue as gambling”. He was prepared to address this by way of counselling.8. The offender did not give evidence before me. His son, Thanh Hieu Nguyen, gave evidence. He was born in 1985 and is the offender’s younger son. He works part time in two jobs, one of them with Fairfield Council as a youth worker and the other as a packer. His elder brother is also in employment. He told me that the offender’s extended family were in Court including his first and second wives and other relatives. He related that his father had always supported him until he was sixteen and that he regularly had time with his father in various activities and stayed with him. No-one in his family has been in any sort of trouble before. He said that his father’s wife’s parents were sponsored to Australia by the offender who paid for their trip and provided for them. He thought there was a $200,000 mortgage on the family home which was serviced at the rate of about $500 a week. Together with other expenses the weekly domestic debt was some $1,000. His father and his father’s wife brought home just over $1,100. He has visited his father regularly in prison.9. Mr Nguyen junior reported that his father was very ashamed, very angry at himself and very sorry for all the stress which he had caused. He knew that he had to be punished and would never do it again. He appreciated the impact his actions had on others and was confused and stressed by his financial burdens. Asked why his father hade committed the offence, Mr Nguyen junior ventured that his father’s intentions had been good because he had wanted to help his families and that there is no chance that this would be repeated. He reported that his father is undertaking various courses in custody including English. He is determined to continue on such rehabilitation courses until he is released. Mr Nguyen junior said that the offence was definitely out of character. He did no think that his father “had it in him”. His father neither drinks nor smokes nor takes drugs. His father has asked him to be a good role model for his other children.10. I heard submissions on sentence on 22 March 2007 from Mr Bellanto QC for the offender and Ms Morkaya for the Crown.11. Mr Bellanto, in dealing with the objective gravity of the offence, pointed out that the offender’s was a low level involvement. That was conceded by Ms Morkaya and I accept that the offender was no more than a courier. In addition, Mr Bellanto urged me to find that his client had been approached by a relative stranger and prevailed upon to undertake this crime. I do not accept that submission. It is quite apparent from the answers given by the offender to a series of questions commencing at Q177 in his ERISP that he initiated the arrangements. He repeatedly asserted that “I ask them” adding “I need money to do something”. There was an interval of some six months after the initial contact and then he was approached at that stage but there is no evidence that he was “prevailed upon”. The opportunity he had sought out to relieve his financial burdens was now being offered to him. Mr Bellanto pointed out, and I accept, that the offender earned a flat fee of $10,000 and not a percentage of the profits. He also urged me to take into account that the drugs were not disseminated into the community. I accept the following passage from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103, referred to me by both legal representatives as stating the appropriate approach to such a situation: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In assessing the sentence to be imposed it is relevant to take into account that the prohibited drugs supplied to the undercover agents will not be disseminated into the community. Of itself this is usually unlikely to lead to other than a very minor diminution of culpability. The offender had the intention to supply and in supplying knew and believed that the drugs would be likely to find their way into the community. The fact that they did not do so was not due to the offender. 
        ” 
         
        
       
      
    Mr Nguyen’s role was clearly that of a courier responding to instructions from those higher up the chain without any knowledge of the larger picture. However whilst I accept as appropriately conceded by the Crown that the offender’s was a low level involvement, I also accept Ms Morkaya’s submission that there was a degree of planning and preparation. That was obvious from the offender’s admission that it was his idea to secrete the drugs in the spare wheel. But I further accept, as Ms Morkaya pointed out, that the planning was limited to the execution of the delivery he was instructed to do.12. Mr Bellanto drew my attention to his client’s motivation. His response in the ERISP was “because I got big mortgage...and my family...life so, yeah, I tried to...pay mortgage”. Whilst I accept that there was no evidence of greed or the offender living the high life there is some evidence, contained in the Probation and Parole Report, of gambling although it appears to be a recent development and one aimed, like this offence, at raising money for the mortgage. Mr Bellanto urged me to mitigate any sentence because the motivation was related to necessity and hardship. I do not accept that submission. Whilst I acknowledge and take into account that he was not driven by greed, he was in a similar position to thousands of families within the community. There was a mortgage and two incomes coming into the house and this required management. In his case, the offender decided to manage this by committing an extraordinarily serious crime.13. Next Mr Bellanto turned to the offender’s personal circumstances. He referred to his age, his strong work record and work ethic and strong family values. I accept and take all those factors into account. I also accept that the offender’s character was not affected by any previous criminal record and that until his involvement in this kind of activity he was a person of good character. Both parties drew my attention to the decision of the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 which had been referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Cassar [1999] NSWCCA 152 at [25]. McInerney AJ said, by reference to that case, that  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        it is important to understand that in considering a past criminal record, the antecedent criminal history is relevant to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration, or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law 
        ”.  
        
       
      
     
     
      I do not accept that this crime was an uncharacteristic aberration because the offender admitted to having couriered drugs to Melbourne on one previous occasion. This was not a one-off offence. However, as I have indicated, I do accept that until he became involved in this activity, he was a person of good character. 
      
    14. Mr Bellanto urged me to find express evidence of contrition. I find that the offender’s plea of guilty is some evidence of contrition. I also find that there is some evidence of contrition through Mr Nguyen junior’s evidence of his father’s reaction to his detection and arrest. He also evidently told the Probation and Parole officer that he was “regretful and acknowledged the seriousness of his actions”. This evidence has some value but it is limited and not as strong as it would have been if it had come from the offender himself in evidence.15. Mr Bellanto urged me, in fixing sentence which he correctly acknowledged must be a custodial sentence, to find, in accordance with s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that there are special circumstances for reducing the non-parole period below three-quartes of the term of the sentence. He listed those factors as his client’s prospects of rehabilitation, the fact that it was his first time in prison, his good character and the motivation for the offence, his work record and the indication by the Probation and Parole office that there might be a need to address gambling. Ms Morkaya conceded, correctly in my view, that it was open for me to find special circumstances in this case. I propose to make that finding and will return to that question towards the end of these remarks.16. Mr Bellanto helpfully provided me with a bundle of relevant authorities. He emphasised two in particular. One was CTC v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 236 which, Mr Bellanto urged, would provide a rough guide to a range for the current offence. That case involved a plea of guilty to the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin, being just over 2 kilograms. The offender’s appeal from the sentence of eight years and six months with a non-parole period of five years and six months was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The offender in that case was an active distributor of drugs for a group of people. In addition, he had previously served two lengthy prison sentences for supplying prohibited drugs. The offender’s plea was late but he had been prepared to plead guilty earlier to a less serious offence. He had provided assistance to the authorities at a significant level. The sentencing Judge had allowed a combined discount for the plea of guilty and the assistance of forty percent.17. The other decision emphasised by Mr Bellanto was Vu v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 188. He said that he drew comfort from Vu. In that case the offender had pleaded guilty to three discreet offences (one being on a Form 1). One was for the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin and the other two were supplies of commercial quantities. The offender received a maximum discount of twenty-five percent. His overall sentence was fourteen years. That was not reduced on appeal but his non-parole period of eleven years was reduced to nine years on appeal. The offender in that case was readily able to obtain large quantities of heroin and was in a position to negotiate price. He was able to hold quality batches of heroin for persons who wanted to obtain it. It was part of an ongoing criminal activity and the offender derived a substantial degree of profit. Vu and CTC, submitted Mr Bellanto, provided a pattern of sentence in respect of this offence.18. By reference to a passage in Chan, Mr Bellanto urged me to accept that this was not a case of supply for profit. I do accept that the offender did not partake in any percentage of the overall profits from the distribution of drugs but he was clearly going to profit immensely for his return trip to Melbourne. I have taken into account the other cases to which Mr Bellanto referred in his submissions.19. In addressing the standard non-parole period provided for this offence (fifteen years pursuant to s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the table to Division 1A of Part 4 of that Act), Mr Bellanto correctly reminded me that the standard non-parole periods “are to be taken as having been intended for a middle-range case where the offender was convicted after trial”: see Vu at [29] per Hall J with whom James and Buddin agreed. As his Honour went on to say “[i]n sentencing after a plea, the standard non-parole period...though not obligatory still takes its place as a reference point” and that, “[a]ccordingly, in the case of a plea of guilty, it is appropriate for a sentencing judge to consider where the particular offence lies on the range of objective seriousness”. It has also been described, by reference to sentencing after a plea, “as a benchmark, reference point, sounding board or guidepost”: see Regina v Misiepo [2005] NSWCCA 405 at [43] per Simpson, J. Mr Bellanto submitted that this case was well below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. After taking into account the objective and subjective factors, he says I could impose a non-parole period as low as five years and reflect general deterrence by the length of the head sentence.20. Ms Morkaya conceded that the plea had been entered at the earliest opportunity and should therefore attract the maximum utilitarian discount of 25%. That was an appropriate concession which I accept. The sentence should be backdated to 20 August 2006, which I propose to do. Ms Morkaya pointed out, so far as objective seriousness was concerned, that the quantity was more than twice the minimum amount for a large commercial quantity. I regard this as relevant and significant. I also regard as relevant and significant the fact that Parliament has affixed a maximum of life imprisonment to the crime which was committed by the offender. I also take into account Ms Morkaya’s submission that although the offender was a low level participant, the distribution of illegal drugs within the community cannot work effectively without such participants. Ms Morkaya conceded that the offender was contrite and had volunteered, by way of admission, that his involvement in a previous trip to Melbourne to deliver drugs. Ms Morkaya also acknowledged his efforts at rehabilitation. She correctly reminded me that the standard non-parole period was a reference point not a starting point and was specifically intended for a sentence following a trial. Objectively speaking, she submitted that I should take into account the quantity of the drug in this case, the financial benefit, the intended dissemination within the community, the planned execution of the trip and the fact that this was not the first time on which the offender had undertaken such an exercise. This should all be seen in the context of his role as a courier.21. Finally, Mr Bellanto urged me to be careful in looking at the earlier trip to Melbourne admitted to by the offender. He acknowledged that his client admitted that he was delivering narcotics but whether or not they were in fact drugs was an open question. In response, Ms Morkaya drew my attention to the statement of facts contained in Exhibit A, admitted into evidence by consent, which recorded that during the course of his interview, the offender “made admissions that he had previously done a single `drug run’ to Melbourne” and “that he was paid $10,000 for conveying 6 blocks (packaged in a similar way to that located by police) to Melbourne.” I note that in answer to Q146 of his ERISP the offender refers to “the drug”. Ms Morkaya drew my attention to the similar packaging and the payment of $10,000 and concluded that there was a high probability that the previous supply was of drugs. I would go further than that. Given the offender’s admissions, the similar packaging and the fact that he was paid $10,000 on the previous occasion, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on that previous occasion he delivered illegal drugs to Melbourne.22. I turn now to determine the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. Appreciating that the standard non-parole period is a reference point or guidepost for sentencing after trial, I do not regard this case as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. That is because the offender was a courier acting on instructions. (I should add that I can see how such a finding was open in the case of Vu.  The offender in that case was readily able to obtain large quantities of heroin and was in a position to negotiate price with respective purchasers. He was also able to hold quality batches of heroin for persons who wanted to obtain similar quality. He was trafficking in hard drugs for a substantial degree of profit.)23. On the other hand, in this case the offender initiated the contact with those who could help him make a substantial amount of money by this means. He intended to facilitate the distribution within the community of twice the large commercial quantity of heroin. He went to some trouble to ensure that his part in the process would go undetected. This was not a spontaneous or opportunistic crime.24. Although not an uncharacteristic aberration, the offender had led an exemplary life up until he decided to become involved in this activity. He has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and there is limited evidence of his contrition. 25. I do not regard this case as being as serious as Vu. The sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Williams in that case had to take into account the criminality involved not only in the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin (as in this case) but two offences of supplying a commercial quantity of the same drug. In addition, his Honour found that the offences were within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. CTC is more comparable to this case. It was a plea of guilty to a large commercial quantity of two kilograms of heroin. It was more serious in that the offender had two previous convictions for supplying drugs for which he received custodial sentences. But on the other hand, CTC benefited from a 40% discount which took into account both the plea and what his Honour Judge Berman SC regarded as assistance to authorities “quite clearly of a significant level” (at [17]).26. Taking all these factors into account, I regard an appropriate head sentence as nine and a half years. I regard the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, the fact that it his first time in prison, his good character and the motivation for the offence as well as his work record and the possibility of needing to address gambling as amounting to special circumstances for the balance of the term of the sentence exceeding one third of the non-parole period. Accordingly I have determined in accordance with s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, to set a non-parole period for the sentence of six years. The balance of the term of the sentence is to be three and a half years. To express this in another way, the offender will be sentenced to an overall sentence of nine and a half years with a non-parole period of six years. 27. In accordance with s 47(2)(a) the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I direct that the sentence of imprisonment is taken to have commenced on 20 August 2006 which is the date from which the offender has been held in custody in relation to this offence. In accordance with s48(1) of that Act, I specify the day on which the sentence is taken to have commenced as 20 August 2006 and the earliest day on which it appears that the offender will become eligible to be released on parole as 19 August 2012.28. So Mr Vu, your overall sentence is nine and a half years, and the non-parole period is six years, and it appears that you will become eligible to be released on parole on 19 August 2012.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Joseph Robert Haoui appeared for trial charged with driving at a speed dangerous to another person or persons whereby his vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which grievous bodily harm was occasioned to Kamal Mousselamani.2 He pleaded not guilty to that charge.3 The only evidence that the crown had to establish the speed that the accused was travelling, came from a police officer, Sergeant John Kelly.4 Before his evidence was given in the trial proper, a voir dire was conducted and I was asked to rule on the admissibility of his evidence. I ruled that his evidence was admissible and he was then called to give evidence before the jury. The jury must have accepted that evidence beyond reasonable doubt in view of the verdict they later returned.5 Because I was anxious not to unnecessarily delay the jury any more than it had been, I indicated, when announcing my decision to admit the evidence of Sergeant Kelly, that I would give my reasons for that decision later. These are those reasons.6 Sergeant Kelly did not actually attend the location in Frederick Street at the time of the collision, although he did go there some considerable time later. Instead he relied on material obtained by other police officers in order to calculate what he said was a conservative value for the speed at which the accused was travelling down Frederick Street immediately before he braked in an effort to avoid colliding with the vehicle in which Mr Mousselamani was travelling.7 Sergeant Kelly’s evidence was that by obtaining various bits of data and then by putting those into well-accepted equations of motion, it was possible to calculate the speed that the accused was driving.8 Mr Campbell SC, who appeared with Mr Bolster for the accused, challenged the admissibility of Sergeant Kelly’s calculations and conclusions on a number of bases. 9 He firstly complained about the circumstances in which the evidence that Sergeant Kelly could give was made known to him. I have mentioned those circumstances in an earlier judgment. It is sufficient for the purposes of this judgment to note that the first report prepared by Sergeant Kelly and served on the accused was seriously deficient. It failed to identify why it was that Sergeant Kelly had chosen particular values to put into the equations and failed to demonstrate that the equations he used were accepted as a valid method of calculating speed from that data.10 However, the crown made an effort to overcome these circumstances by the provision of further reports prepared by Sergeant Kelly. Those reports were served very late on the accused. Indeed, the trial had been proceeding for some time before the final report was served on the accused and that was done a very short time before Sergeant Kelly was called to give evidence.11 This is hardly a commendable state of affairs, but the question as to whether Sergeant Kelly’s evidence was admissible or not does not depend on whether this state of affairs is commendable or not.12 In these circumstances, Mr Campbell asked me to exclude the evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act. He said that there was a danger of unfair prejudice to his client which had come about because of the history I have shortly outlined. 13 Section 137 is usually directed to circumstances in which evidence is put before a jury and there is a risk that the jury will misuse that evidence. But even if the section can be applied in circumstances such as I have described, then I can see no reason for concluding that danger of unfair prejudice to the accused outweighs the probative value of the evidence.14 In performing that balancing exercise, I must first consider the probative value of Sergeant Kelly’s evidence. Once the faults which are apparent in Sergeant Kelly’s first report are overcome by the provision of other written material from Sergeant Kelly which was then supplemented by the oral evidence which was given on the voir dire, the basis of Sergeant Kelly’s conclusion becomes apparent.15 He has explained why he chose particular values and the evidence is such that there is now a basis demonstrated for his selection of those values. There is now also demonstrated the validity, or at least the general acceptance of the equations he uses in order to come to the conclusion he does.16 When I compare that to the danger of unfair prejudice, I note that what Mr Campbell was submitting was that he suffered forensic difficulties because of the late service of the necessary evidence.17 However, when I pressed Mr Campbell in an effort to discover precisely what those forensic difficulties were, and more importantly how they prejudiced his client, it became clear to me that any difficulties or prejudice could easily be overcome by adjournments and directions.18 If Mr Campbell did wish to seek the opinion of his own expert, I would have granted him time to do so. If that required the recalling of crown witnesses, again I would have allowed him to do so. Any fear that the jury might hold his client responsible for the subsequent delay could be dealt with by me telling the jury, in forceful terms if necessary, that any delay and inconvenience is solely the responsibility of the prosecution because they had failed to do what they should have done before the trial got underway.19 I note in passing that I did tell the jury in any case that the reason they had spent so much time out of the courtroom while we dealt with legal issues was because of the crown obtaining and serving information very late.20 Mr Campbell also submitted that Sergeant Kelly’s opinion was also inadmissible because he failed to explain the basis for it. Whether that was the case before the voir dire evidence was completed is one thing, but I am satisfied that once all his reports had been tendered and his evidence given, the basis on which his opinion was formed was fully explained and a proper basis for choosing those values and equations had been shown.21 Sergeant Kelly gave evidence that in order to calculate a speed at time of impact he needed to know the angle at which the vehicles collided, their post-impact angle of travel, the distance they travelled after impact and their coefficient of friction on the roadway. He explained why he had chosen the values that he had.22 The impact angles were estimated from photographs taken by police showing the damage to the vehicles. The mass of the vehicles he obtained from RTA records, making allowances for fuel state and the number of passengers. The distance travelled after collision was measured by police who attended the scene of the collision and Sergeant Kelly used those figures.23 He was able to work out the departure angle of travel for each vehicle because he knew from a plan prepared by police where the vehicles had ended up and he knew from some glass on the roadway where the collision had occurred.24 In each case, Sergeant Kelly said that he used conservative values, which meant that where there was any margin of error he chose a figure which favoured the accused, that is, which underestimated the speed which would ultimately be calculated.25 As far as the coefficient of friction is concerned, Sergeant Kelly’s estimation of this came in two stages. 26 At the time of preparing his first report, he had not been to Frederick Street but used his experience in analysing motor vehicle collisions to estimate what the coefficient of friction actually was. He knew that visible tyre marks had been left on the roadway which suggested that the coefficient of friction must have been above a certain level, otherwise any skid marks would have been invisible to the naked eye.27 He also knew the nature of the road surface and the roadway was wet. From his years of experience in investigating motor vehicle collisions, he was able to estimate a figure for the appropriate coefficient of friction, and again he explained he chose a conservative figure, that is, one which favoured the accused.28 Some years later, after police had purchased a particular item of equipment, he went out to Frederick Street and actually measured the coefficient of friction. 29 As Mr Campbell pointed out, there are a number of differences between the test he did that day and the circumstances which existed at the time of the collision. These differences were all the subject of cross-examination, but Sergeant Kelly was able to explain how those different circumstances would have affected the result he obtained, and the utility of the coefficient of friction he measured as being a guide to other coefficient of friction which existed at the time of the collision.30 However, the most important aspect of the later test done by Sergeant Kelly is that it tended to suggest the accuracy of the figure he had earlier estimated from his experience, that is, the coefficient of friction he measured was not more favourable to the accused than the coefficient of friction he had earlier estimated in performing his calculation.31 Sergeant Kelly also explained why he had used the equation which he had used to calculate the pre-impact speed, that equation being well-recognised in textbooks devoted to the analysis of motor vehicle collisions.32 Having calculated the pre-impact speed, Sergeant Kelly was then able to measure the length of the skid marks and, again using the coefficient of friction, calculate the speed the accused’s vehicle was doing at the start of the skid marks. As I have said, this speed he calculated as ninety-one kilometres an hour.33 There could be no challenge to a submission that travelling at ninety-one kilometres an hour was a dangerous speed in the circumstances.34 As I have explained, Sergeant Kelly was able to demonstrate the validity of the values he had chosen as well as the acceptance of the equations to which those values were put in order to calculate the speed of the accused’s vehicle.35 Another matter which Mr Campbell suggested would render Sergeant Kelly’s evidence inadmissible was a suggested failure to demonstrate any expertise enabling Sergeant Kelly to give the evidence he did. I will not delay matters by setting out Sergeant Kelly’s history of work and education. It is all set out in the transcript and his reports.36 It is not to the point, that some other person might have had more expertise, or might even disagree with the values chosen or the equations used, (not that Mr Campbell suggested any of these matters). This is not a case where there was a suggestion made that Sergeant Kelly was using untested science or that he was attempting to use equations of motion in circumstances where they had never been used before.37 I am satisfied that Sergeant Kelly’s expertise extended sufficiently such that he had the specialised knowledge or training required in order to provide an opinion which could be acted upon by the jury.38 Finally, Mr Campbell referred to s 136 of the Evidence Act. He said that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial, misleading or confusing, and suggested that I could limit the evidence that Sergeant Kelly could give. That is not what s 136 is directed to. It is directed to the position where the jury would have been told that they could not use evidence which had been given in a particular way. It is not directed to preventing the evidence being admitted in the first place.39 The evidence of Sergeant Kelly was clearly important, and indeed the crown had no case without it. It is for that reason that a great deal of attention was paid to the admissibility of Sergeant Kelly’s evidence, and in particular to the validity of the values he chose to put into the equations he used.40 Having observed the evidence and having read his reports, I formed the view that his evidence was admissible for the reasons I have just given.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BARR J: Brendan John Roberts seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. He pleaded guilty at the Local Court to two charges of the aggravated offence of detaining for advantage in company and to four charges of robbery in company. Each of the six offences attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years. The applicant was committed to the District Court for sentence. On 10 February 2006 Hulme SC DCJ sentenced the applicant for the two offences of detention to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and nine months, dating from 15 December 2005, and a balance of term of two years, expiring on 14 September 2011. For each of the four offences of robbery in company his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of three years commencing on 15 December 2004 and expiring 14 December 2007. The total effective sentence thereby achieved was a non-parole period of four years and nine months and a balance of sentence of two years.  
     
      
    2 A co-offender, Ashley Dwayne Sloan, was sentenced at the same time.  
     
      
    3 The facts were described thus by the sentencing judge -  
     
      
       
        
        In the early evening of 29 February 2004, Ms Susan Sluiter and her boyfriend, Mr Scott Wardle, drove to the car park near the Dumaresq Street cinema in Campbelltown. They were in a silver Tarago van and when they arrived they sat in the van discussing which movie they wanted to see. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The offender Sloan approached the driver's side of the van and said to Ms Sluiter, ""Is there any chance you could give us a lift?"" and also whether she had any spare change that he could use to catch a bus or a taxi. 
          
        Ms Sluiter became uncomfortable and told the offender to go away. Mr Wardle locked his door and reached across to lock the driver's door but the offender placed his arm on the window preventing it being wound up. He produced a screwdriver and said ""We're going to have a look through your wallets"". 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        It was at this point that the victims became aware of the offender Roberts approaching from behind Sloan. Both offenders demanded money from the victims' wallets. Sloan was pointing the screwdriver at them at the time. The victims were asked for their names and addresses which they divulged. Mr Wardle and Ms Sluiter were forced to hand over fifty dollars and twenty  
         
        dollars respectively.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The offender Roberts then demanded Mr Wardle’s bank card and his personal identification number.  
         
        There was mention of going to the nearby ATM. At this point, Ms Sluiter attempted to unlock the steering wheel and put the keys in the ignition but Sloan said to her ""Don't start the car, I've got a gun"". 
        
       
       
        
        Roberts opened the sliding door and both offenders entered the rear of the van. Ms Sluiter was then told to drive to an ATM. 
        
       
       
        
        During the drive, the offender Sloan told the victims J that he had just been released from prison for having killed someone. 
        
       
       
        
        The offenders told the victims to turn off their mobile phones, and they complied. 
        
       
       
        
        At the direction of the offender Sloan, Ms Sluiter drove to Woodhouse Drive, Ambarvale and parked. At his direction, she  
         
        then gave her bank card and PIN to Mr Wardle who then alighted from the van with the offender Roberts and was taken to an ATM. Roberts had his hand under his shirt and was covering his face as they approached the machine. At Roberts' direction, Mr Wardle withdrew seventy dollars from his own account and forty dollars from Ms Sluiter's account. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Wardle and the offender Roberts returned to the van. At this point Ms Sluiter was crying. Mr Wardle said to the offenders, ""You have our money and we're driving you around, just please don't harm us or kill us"". One of the offenders responded ""If you play the game right nobody will get hurt”. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender Sloan then told Ms Sluiter to drive to the taxi rank at Campbelltown. When the arrived Roberts alighted and returned a short time later with a female, Ms Cidgem Kucukozman, who was referred to as ""Cindy”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Sluiter was then directed to drive to various places and ultimately they ended up in a car park near a reserve on Georges River Road. Here, the two offenders and Ms Kucukozman injected themselves with what they said was Valium and heroin. At one point the offender Sloan pointed a used needle at Mr Wardle and Ms Sluiter and said ""I've got AIDS, if I wanted to, if you're uncooperative, will jab you with it"". 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        It was at about this time that the offenders wrote the victim's addresses down and threatened that if they went to the police their houses would be burned down. The facts document also indicates that the victims were in such fear that on several occasions they begged for their lives. 
         
         
        The offender Sloan sat between the two victims and told Ms Sluiter to kiss him on the cheek. She complied, obviously out of fear. Ms Kucukozman then complained of becoming jealous and started to perform oral sex upon Sloan. Sloan told Mr Wardle to look at them but he turned away and said he did not want to. 
         
         
        Sloan and Kucukozman then proceeded to have sexual intercourse in the back of the van. This was followed by Kucukozman again performing oral sex upon Sloan, during which Sloan directed Ms Sluiter to get into the back of the van and give him a hug and a kiss whist that was going on. Ms Sluiter partially complied. The offender Kucukozman said ""You don't known what you're missing out on"". Sloan directed Ms Sluiter to look at his penis. She did, and noticed a particular abnormality. 
         
         
        Sloan and Kucukozman proceeded to ask Ms Sluiter and Mr Wardle personal questions about their relationship. They were asked whether they had engaged in particular sexual activity and they replied that they were not ready and wanted to wait until they were married. At one point Sloan said to Mr Wardle ""Can't you see your missus is on heat, I want to see you both get it on"". He then told Ms Sluiter to giver Mr Wardle a head job and when she refused he said that Kucukozman could do it. Roberts added that ""You can always lick some pussy, that's not sex"". 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Sluiter was directed to continue driving. They stopped at some shops and the offender Roberts alighted and purchased some soft drink. Sloan and Kucukozman were still engaging in oral sex. 
         
         
        At around this time Sloan placed a silver necklace around Mr Wardle's neck, saying ""I want you to have this, it was my mother's"". 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Sluiter was directed to continue driving around Airds. Kucukozman told her ""They're really dangerous, don't do anything"" and then kissed Ms Sluiter on the top of the head. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Mr Wardle offered to pray for the offenders and Ms Sluiter was directed to stop the van at a reserve. All alighted and formed a circle, holding hands, with Mr Wardle praying for the offenders. Sloan then said, ""We'll pay you back for what you we took. We don't like doing these things. If you go to the police we know where you live and we'll come after you"". The offenders Sloan and Roberts then wiped the van with a towel and with the offender Kucukozman walked away. 
        
       
      
    4 The sentencing judge described the applicant’s subjective features thus -  
     
      
       
        
        The offender Roberts was born on 18 December 1978 and was thus aged twenty-five at the time of the offence and is twenty-seven now.  
         
         
        He has a criminal history that commenced with a stealing offence in the Children's Court when he was seventeen. Before the offences with which I am concerned he last appeared before the courts in August 2002 for two dishonesty offences. His record is not overly long and it is notable that all matters have been dealt with in Magistrates’ Courts. He has never been sentenced as an adult to imprisonment. It is a record that denies to him the leniency that would otherwise be extended to someone without prior convictions.  
         
         
        The offender's background is set out in a report of Ms Katie Seidler, psychologist. He was the second eldest of four sons. His parents separated when he was about four and he remained with his mother and brothers. It is reported that his father was a heavy drinker and was violent. The offender did not get on well with his mother, nor with his brothers. He suffered physical abuse and was also sexually assaulted on a number of occasions by a male family friend around the age of eight. A good proportion of his childhood was spent living with family friends in Condobolin with whom he got on well. Ms Seidler described his family life and upbringing as ""disturbed and dysfunctional"". 
         
         
        In other material before me - the pre-sentence report and evidence from the offender's mother - it is indicated that the offender was diagnosed with ADHD as a child.  
         
         
        The offender's schooling was limited and he was forced to leave in year nine because of poor attendance and disruptive behaviour. He completed his School Certificate equivalency through TAFE and obtained a certificate in landscaping through Skill Share. Despite this he has never held full-time employment but has worked casually in farm labouring positions. 
         
         
        The offender was in a relationship for about three years with a woman who was considerably older than he was. They had a daughter, Kayla, who is now aged five. She was diagnosed with Glutaric Aciduria which is said to be a rare genetic condition affecting the functioning of the nervous system and is incurable. She spends considerable time in hospital. Her mother has nothing to do with her and so the offender has been the primary care giver. The Probation and Parole officer reported that the offender had been on a carer's pension for the three years prior to going into custody. The girl has been cared for by the offender's mother since then. The offender told Ms Seidler that children with Glutaric Acideria do not live past middle childhood. This is largely confirmed in a letter from Ms Yvonne To'a, the Aboriginal Liaison Officer at Blacktown Hospital (exhibit 6). Mrs To'a confirms some evidence that was given by the offender's mother to the effect that Kayla is quite distressed at the enforced separation from her father. She frets on occasion and this exacerbates the difficulties she experiences with her poor immune system. 
         
         
        The offender has a length history of alcohol and drug abuse. He began drinking at the age of ten and regards himself as an alcoholic. He started smoking cannabis at the age of twelve and regarded his use of this drug as ""problematic"". He also abused benzodiazepine medications, amphetamines and crystal methamphetamine. As a means of coming down from amphetamine he injected heroin several times a day every second day. In the period leading up to the offences it would seem that the offender's abuse of such substances was rampant. It begs the question how devoted he could have been to the care of his daughter.  
         
         
        The offender has had minimal participation in drug rehabilitation programs in the past. It is a matter of some concern that whilst he acknowledged that he had a problem with drugs and alcohol he ""questioned the usefulness of treatment or counselling and instead stated that he believes he needs to address his substance abuse independently"". I respectfully agree with Ms Seidler's assessment that such ideas are unrealistic and naive. I note that there is contradictory material in the pre­sentence report. It is there indicated that the offender had attended some alcohol and drug counselling sessions in gaol, albeit his response was not entirely satisfactory, and had said that he would be interested in entering a residential drug rehabilitation program. 
         
         
        A further matter of concern noted in Ms Seidler's report is the suggestion that the offender has potentially developed a psychotic-like illness. This is a matter that requires expert evaluation by a psychiatrist. I note that the Probation and Parole officer has made a referral to the prison psychiatrist.  
         
         
        Other matters noted by Ms Seidler in her catalogue of the offender's difficulties include a reported history of depression. A history of suicide ideation, and a self-description of quick temperedness. She administered a number of tests and found him to be ""a man functioning at a low level of intelligence in the borderline range"". She describes has as ""a simple man intellectually, whose cognitive resources would be further compromised by stress, emotional difficulties or the ingestion of drugs and alcohol"". 
         
         
        Ms Seidler concludes her report with a variety of recommendations and suggestions for the offender's rehabilitation. Quite clearly he is a man who needs intensive assistance both whilst in custody and following release into the community. Whether he accepts this to be the case and would thereby respond to such assistance is another matter. The uncertainty as to his attitude towards the treatment of his substance abuse issues is a matter of concern. The pre-sentence report concludes with similar recommendations as to the need for intensive assistance. 
         
         
        Further material relating to the offender's background and the situation relating to his daughter is before me in the form of a letter and oral evidence from his mother Ms Anne Brown. She indicated when the offender is released they have planned that he will live with her and seek employment and she will continue to assist in the care of Kayla. She also indicates he is motivated to ""get rehabilitated"" but whether there is an appreciation of the need for intensive intervention in this regard is not clear. 
        
       
      
    5 In the first ground of appeal the applicant complains that although his Honour made a finding of special circumstances, the sentence failed properly to reflect that finding. During the remarks on sentence his Honour said this -  
     
      
       
        
        It is clearly the case in respect to both offenders that they are in need of intensive assistance both whilst in custody and following release on parole in order to assist them with their complex array of problems identified in the reports that are before me. An extended period of parole supervision is necessary and 1 propose making an appropriate allowance for this. An adjustment of the usual proportions is also necessary because of the manner in which I propose to accumulate sentences.  
        
       
      
    6 Then, having announced the sentences, his Honour said -  
     
      
       
        
        Mr Roberts the total effect of that is that the total term of imprisonment is seven years and effectively there  
        is  
        a non-parole period amounting to four years and nine months. 
         
        
       
      
    7 It was submitted on appeal that his Honour miscalculated. The total effective term was six years and nine months, not seven years as announced. It followed that his Honour’s intention, which was to reduce the non-parole period by six months, was not achieved. The result was only a three-month reduction. That was insufficient for the purposes of parole identified by his Honour.  
     
      
    8 I do not accept that submission. His Honour nowhere said that there should be a reduction of six months. His Honour did say that there was a need for an extended period of parole and did give effect to that need. Nothing about the case suggests to me that his Honour’s mathematical error lay in the calculation of the non-parole period rather than in the total effective sentence. Nothing in the judgment suggests to me that the purposes identified by his Honour could be achieved if the balance of term were two years and three months but not if it were only two years.  
     
      
    9 This ground of appeal has not been made good.  
     
      
    10 In the second ground of appeal the applicant complains that his Honour erred by not finding that such highly exceptional circumstances existed as justified a reduction in sentence. Those circumstances were the degree of hardship that the sentence would cause for third parties.  
     
      
    11 It was submitted to the sentencing judge that the effect of imprisonment upon the applicant’s five-year-old daughter and his mother, who cared for her, was so exceptional as to justify a reduction in sentence. His Honour did not accept that submission, saying -  
     
      
       
        
        Mr Matouk has submitted that I should find the situation relating to the offender's daughter to be so highly exceptional that 1 should take it into account. The child is gravely ill – so much I accept. Anyone would be moved by sympathy for her plight. I do, however, have significant reservations whether the circumstances can be described as highly exceptional. The child is being cared for by the offender's mother and there  
        is  
        no suggestion that such care is inadequate in any way. In the pre-sentence report it is indicated that Miss Brown is willing to care for the child for as long as is required. It is also noted that she is receiving some respite care. When it has been necessary for the child's spirits to be lifted with the offender that has been arranged in the form of telephone calls to the gaol. Miss Brown also takes the child to visit the offender. Whilst as 1 have said I am sympathetic to the considerable difficulties faced by young Kayla, the proper application of sentencing principles requires me to impose sentences that adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offences. 
        
       
      
    12 It was submitted on appeal that his Honour erred. Attention was drawn to the evidence of the effects of the child’s condition. There were severe delays in speech, movement and learning. The child experienced dystonia, a fluctuation of movement in the arms and legs, severe muscle spasms and seizures. She had to be fed by a tube into the stomach. She was wheelchair-bound and so restricted in movement that all she could do was roll on her back and shuffle around the bed. There were frequent fits and frequent upper respiratory tract infections. It was necessary to take her to hospital from time to time. She suffered from asthma. The applicant’s mother was willing to continue to care for the child but was ageing and finding her duties stressful. The child had a strong bond with the applicant who, before his imprisonment, had cared for her himself. The child fretted and became ill without regular contact with the applicant. 
     
      
    13 It must hardly ever happen that the imprisonment of one person will not have a serious effect upon innocent persons. The courts routinely impose substantial prison sentences upon breadwinners and carers of children and the disabled. In R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 501 Gleeson CJ reviewed the authorities and cited this passage from the judgment of Wells J in R v Wirth (1976) 14 SASR 291 at 295 – 6. Wells J said this -  
     
      
       
        
        The argument thus presented to us raises the following question: When (if ever), and to what extent (if at all), should the hardship caused, directly or indirectly, by a proposed sentence of imprisonment, to the family of, or to others closely associated with, the offender be taken into account by the Court in mitigation of that sentence? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Hardship to spouse, family, and fiiends, is the tragic, but inevitable, consequence of almost every conviction and penalty recorded in a Criminal Court. ... It seems to me that courts would often do less than their clear duty - especially where the element of retribution, deterrence, or protection of society is the predominant consideration - if they allowed themselves to be much influenced by the hardship that prison sentences, which from all other points of view were justified, would be likely to cause to those near and dear to prisoners. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        But it has been often remarked that the strength of our law lies in the willingness of judges, when applying a principle, not to carry it past the point where a sense of mercy or of affronted common sense imperatively demands that they should draw back. So it is proper that I should here add that, in my opinion, hardship likely to be caused by a sentence of imprisonment under consideration ought to be taken into account where the circumstances are highly exceptional, where it would be, in effect, inhuman to refuse to do so. For example, if it were demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that to send a man to prison would, without much doubt, drive his wife to suicide, it would be a steely-hearted judge who did not, however illogically, at least try to meet the situation by suitably framed orders as to penalty. But further than that, in my judgment, courts should not go. 
         
        
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge was well aware of the principle that applied. In considering the effect of the applicant’s imprisonment upon the child, his Honour noted that she was being cared for and that there was no suggestion that the care was inadequate, that the evidence showed that the applicant’s mother was prepared to continue to care for the child. The child missed her father but his Honour noted that her spirits could be lifted by her speaking to him on the telephone. The applicant’s mother had taken the child to the gaol to visit the applicant. 
     
      
    15 In my opinion it was open to his Honour upon the evidence to be satisfied that appropriate measures had been taken for the child’s care. His Honour also questioned, and I think was entitled to question, the degree of devotion of the applicant for his daughter and, perhaps, the effectiveness of any care he was prepared to offer, in view of the fact that during the period leading up to the commission of the offences he was rampant in his abuse of illegal substances. 
     
      
    16 It seems to me that his Honour’s assessment of the circumstances, tragic though they were, as not of that highly exceptional nature as to justify a reduction in sentence, was one that was open.  
     
      
    17 The applicant tendered further evidence on appeal, being evidence of the development or continuation of circumstances known upon sentencing. The evidence comprised a report of a paediatrician, Dr Andrew McDonald, and an affidavit of Mrs Brown, the applicant’s mother.  
     
      
    18 Dr Roberts’ report is undated but was probably written in September 2006. It says something about the effects of the condition Glutaric Aciduria Type 1 but does not suggest that the effects on the child differ from what the sentencing judge was given to understand. Dr McDonald observes that the child’s weight has now increased to 22 kilograms, making her heavy to lift. Mrs Brown has to lift her in and out of the commode chair for showering. Dr McDonald also says something about the age and physical condition of Mrs Brown, though those were all matters known at the time of sentencing. Dr McDonald offers the opinion that the burden of care on Mrs Brown is unsustainable in the longer term and observes that if Mrs Brown becomes unwell or unable to look after the child the only option will be long-term foster care, which might damage the child’s mental state.  
     
      
    19 Mrs Brown for the most part repeats what she said to the sentencing judge but draws attention to the increasing weight of the child and to the increasing difficulty she has in caring for her. She has difficulty getting her on and off public transport and find it necessary to use taxis from time to time. That is burdensome even though she has a taxi subsidy.  
     
      
    20 This evidence shows that things are no better, and probably a little worse, than in February 2006 when the applicant was sentenced. Even so, the evidence does not in my view make this case of so highly exceptional a nature that the applicant’s sentence ought to be reduced on account of the hardship resulting to the child and to the applicant’s mother. I note that the non-parole period is due to expire about two and one half years from now. 21 This ground of appeal has not been made good. 
     
      
    22 In the third ground of appeal the applicant complains that his sentence is unjustly high compared to that imposed upon his co-offender.  
     
      
    23 The offender’s total sentences of five years and nine months for the detention offences and three years for the robbery offences produced an overall total sentence of six years and nine months. Sloan had to be sentenced for those offences, for two assaults provided for on a schedule, for the two acts of indecency he committed with Ms Kucukozman and for escaping from lawful custody. His total sentence for the detention offences was seven years and six months, his Honour having taken into account on the first of those offences the two assaults on the schedule. The sentences imposed for the four robberies were identical to those imposed on the applicant. For the two acts of indecency Sloan was sentenced to concurrent terms of one year and six months and for escaping from lawful custody to a term of one year, comprising a non-parole period of nine months and a balance of term of three months. The total effective sentences for all those offences was of nine years, comprising a non-parole period of six years and a balance of term of three years.  
     
      
    24 Attention was drawn on appeal to the greater role that Sloan played in the detention offences. It may be accepted that Sloan did play a more important role. His Honour said this -  
     
      
       
        
         
        In terms of objective seriousness alone the sentences for the s86 offences to be imposed upon Sloan should be greater than those to be imposed upon Roberts because he played a more leading role. The robbery sentences should generally be the same as they both played a roughly equal role. There are subjective circumstances which warrant other distinctions in the sentences to be imposed. 
        
       
      
    25 The subjective circumstances of the two co-offenders were different. Both had had difficult childhoods characterised by deprivation of the support and example of responsible adults. Both had been in trouble with the law before, though Sloan’s was a more serious record than the applicant’s. As a juvenile Sloan had committed assault, affray, aggravated entry of a dwelling with intent to use corporal violence, malicious damage and robbery in company. As an adult he had been convicted of possessing a prohibited drug, being carried in a conveyance, having stolen goods in his custody and possessing implements to use and drive a conveyance, as well as of traffic offences. He had had a long association with the use of illegal drugs. However, he was only twenty-one years old when he committed the subject offences.  
     
      
    26 The applicant had been found guilty in the Children’s Court on several occasions of stealing and kindred offences. In the Local Court he had been convicted of stealing, of making a false instrument, of using a false instrument, of behaving in an offensive manner and of assault.  
     
      
    27 To my mind the most significant difference subjectively between the applicant and Sloan was that of their ages. A difference in age of four years between two men in their early twenties is significant. It seems to me that Sloan had a greater entitlement because of that difference to point to his deprived childhood as something to be taken into account in fashioning the sentence. His Honour did so.  
     
      
    28 It is correct to say, as the applicant submits, that the sentences imposed upon Sloan for the acts of indecency and the escape ran internally to all the other sentences imposed. It would not be correct, however, to conclude that Sloan was not punished for those offences. He was entitled, as I have said, to draw attention to his youth and to lay claim to the operation of the principles of totality of criminality.  
     
      
    29 Comparing the two overall sentences, nine years and six years nine months, and taking into account the greater role played by Sloan in the detention offences, it seems to me that the relative sentences fell well within the discretion of the sentencing judge. In my opinion the applicant’s sense of grievance is not a justifiable one. This ground of appeal has not been made good. 
     
      
    30 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.  
     
      
    31 ADAMS J: I agree with Rothman J.  
     
      
    32 ROTHMAN J: Brendan John Roberts seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed by His Honour Judge Hulme SC DCJ on 10 February 2006.  
     
      
    33 The applicant for leave to appeal had pleaded guilty to two charges of aggravated detain for advantage (contrary to section 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and four counts of robbery in company (contrary to section 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)). The aggravated detain for advantage in company carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment of twenty years and the robbery in company also carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for twenty years. 
     
      
    34 His Honour Judge Hulme SC DCJ sentenced the applicant in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Counts 1 and 2 (aggravated detain for advantage in company): imprisonment for a non-parole period of three years and nine months to date from 15 December 2005 and expire on 14 September 2009 with a balance of term of two years to expire on 14 September 2011; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Counts 3 – 6 (four counts of robbery in company): imprisonment for a fixed term of imprisonment of three years to date from 15 December 2004 and expire on 14 December 2007.  
        
       
      
    35 The applicant seeks leave to appeal on three grounds:  
     
      
       
      (1) That his Honour did not implement in the ultimate sentence imposed the finding of special circumstances that was intended to be reflected; 
       
       
      (2) That his Honour erred in not finding highly exceptional circumstances including hardship to third parties justifying a reduction in the prison sentence to be imposed;  
       
       
      (3) Parity: the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance compared to the sentence imposed on his co-offender.  
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    36 Barr J sets out the findings of Hulme SC DCJ as to the facts that underpin the sentencing exercise being undertaken. His Honour also sets out the findings made by Hulme SC DCJ on the subjective features that apply to the applicant. It is unnecessary to repeat them.  
     
      
    37 It is important to recite that the applicant with two others, one male and one female, apprehended a male and female victim who had parked in the car park at or near Campbelltown Cinema and were intending to attend the movies.  
     
      
    38 The two victims were in a Tarago van. They were apprehended at the point of a screw driver by the male co-offender and required to produce their wallets. All three offenders, i.e. the applicant and the male and female co-offenders entered the vehicle and required the two victims to drive around, attend an Automatic Telling Machine and obtain moneys. They intimidated the two victims in a number of ways. Those ways included the male and female co-offenders engaging in a variety of sexual acts in the back of the van and made suggestive advances towards the female victim.  
     
      
    39 During the course of these events, the applicant, Roberts, was not engaged in any of the sexual conduct, which the other two offenders performed. However, Mr Roberts (the applicant in these proceedings) did demand money from the victims, threatened them either by conduct or statements and forced the male victim to withdraw monies ($70 from his account at the ATM).  
     
      
    40 The three offenders eventually left the two victims without having physically injured them but having significantly affected them in terms of their emotional and psychological well-being. On leaving, the male co-offender threatened the two victims if they were to report these matters to the police.  
     
      
    41 His Honour found that the male co-offender who was sentenced at the same time as the applicant, was, in terms of objective seriousness of the section 86 (detain for advantage) offences more culpable than the applicant. While, his Honour the sentencing judge determined that the robbery sentences should generally be the same, he found that the co-offender “played a more leading role” in the detain for advantage offences. However, his Honour found that the criminality of the applicant was not “much less”. This he found because, while the applicant was not the instigator of most of the conduct that occurred, he had supported his co-offender and reinforced the fear that they had sought to instil in the victims.  
     
      
    42 It should be borne in mind that the male co-offender who was sentenced at the same time as the applicant was also charged with and had pleaded guilty to two aggravated acts of indecency carrying a maximum sentence of three years and a count of escape from lawful custody carrying a maximum sentence of ten years.  
     
      
    43 In relation to the subjective circumstances of the applicant, Barr J has set those out, and I reiterate that his Honour the sentencing judge found special circumstances.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Special Circumstances 
       
      
    44 His Honour found the existence of special circumstances and the need for the applicant to be on an extended period of parole to assist him in his complex array of problems. His Honour found, apart from making an appropriate allowance for the necessity of extended parole supervision, that there was a need to adjust the sentence because of the effect of accumulation on the sentence. His Honour then said (remarks on sentence page 27.6): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Roberts, in respect of the offences of robbery in company, each of them, you are sentenced to imprisonment comprising fixed terms of three years. They are to date from 15 December 2004 and to expire on 14 December 2007.  
        
       
       
        
        In respect of each of the offences of aggravated detain for advantage you are sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and nine months that is to date from 15 December 2005 and to expire on 14 September 2009. Thereafter you will be eligible for release on parole. There will be a balance of the term of the sentence of two years.  
        
       
       
        
        Mr Roberts, the total effect of that is that the total term of imprisonment is seven years and effectively there is a non-parole period amounting to four years and nine months.” 
          
        
       
      
    45 In fact the sentence imposed was for a period of six years and nine months with a non-parole period of four years and nine months. Absent special circumstances, the application of the statutory ratio to a total term of imprisonment of six years and nine months would warrant a non-parole period of approximately five years. The “special circumstances” in fact effected a reduction in the non-parole period of three months.  
     
      
    46 It is clear from the above quotation from his Honour’s remarks that the three paragraphs cannot logically sit together and give a consistent result. The final paragraph which recites the overall sentence is inconsistent with the sentence otherwise imposed. 
     
      
    47 The difficulty for this Court is to determine which of the two results was the intention of his Honour. In the circumstances, it is necessary for us to discern an intention or to exercise our own discretion. 
     
      
    48 However the quoted extract from his Honour’s sentence makes clear that his Honour miscalculated that which his Honour was intending. If his Honour’s total effective sentence was as described, there would have been a reduction of six months in the non-parole period and a consequent extension in the period of supervision. This seems to have been the intent of his Honour and, with respect to him, it seems as if his Honour has miscalculated in making the adjustment for the accumulation of sentences.  
     
      
    49 A finding of special circumstances will not always warrant a reduction in the non-parole period and the level of reduction in the non-parole period, if any, determined by a sentencing judge will not ordinarily be subject to review on anything other than a criterion which would warrant the interference with an exercise of discretion. However, in the current circumstances, I am of the view that the sentence imposed by his Honour did not reflect his Honour’s intention and a further reduction to give effect to a six month reduction in a non-parole period would give effect to his Honour’s reasoning and his Honour’s actual intent.  
     
      
       
      Parity  
       
      
    50 The applicant also submits that there exists a justifiable sense of grievance in the sentence imposed upon him compared to the sentence imposed upon his male co-offender.  
     
      
    51 The principles of parity in sentencing have been dealt with on a number of occasions and are now well settled. Justice Dawson (with whom Wilson J agreed) summarised the principle in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606, in which his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no rule of law which requires co-offenders to be given the same sentence for the same offence even if no distinction can be drawn between them. Obviously where the circumstances of each offender or his involvement in the offence are different then different sentences may be called for but justice should be even-handed and it has come to be recognised both here and in England that any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not to be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done.” (154 CLR at 623) 
        
       
      
    52 His Honour Justice Dawson in a joint judgment with Justice Gaudron in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 developed the statement in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion in the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v R, recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to a ‘justifiable sense of grievance’. If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.” 
        
       
      
    53 The application of the principle embodied in the joint judgments and applied on innumerable occasions can often lead to some difficulty. In the present proceeding the notion of parity must take account of the circumstance that the co-offender was charged with, and sentenced for, a number of offences over and above those offences with which the applicant was charged. Further, in order to compare like with like, it is not simply a question of ignoring the sentence imposed for the further offences. The principle of totality of sentencing required his Honour to take account of the totality of the criminal conduct of the co-offender and this may have impacted, not only by virtue of the sentence imposed for the additional offences, in the sentence imposed for the charges common to both the applicant and the co-offender.  
     
      
    54 The sentencing judge, in this case, was, in relation to the co-offender, required to deal with two counts of aggravated acts of indecency pursuant to the terms of section 61O of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). For those offences his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of eighteen months fixed term for each. His Honour also sentenced for an escape. Each such sentence being wholly concurrent with the other. Further his Honour dealt with the principle of totality by providing for partial accumulation. The sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Accumulation or Concurrence and the Principle of Totality 
        
       
       
        
        It is appropriate that there be a degree of partial accumulation of the sentences to reflect the fact that there was a difference in the type of offences committed and the fact that there were two victims, but in so accumulating I will bear in mind that the offences were committed on the one occasion and involved a considerable degree of overlapping criminality. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the offence of escape it is necessary that this sentence be completely accumulated upon the other sentence to be imposed on the [co-] offender.” 
        
       
      
    55 It is clear that in these circumstances the principle of totality has been accommodated by the degree of accumulation or concurrence of the sentences rather than an alteration in the sentences provided. In those circumstances one can more readily compare the sentence imposed on the applicant and his co-offender.  
     
      
    56 The co-offender was sentenced for the robbery in company to a fixed term of three years’ imprisonment. For the same offences the applicant was sentenced to the same fixed term of imprisonment. This accords with his Honour’s stated intention and finding that in relation to the robbery the criminality of both offenders was identical.  
     
      
    57 In relation to the offence of aggravated detain for advantage, the co-offender was sentenced to imprisonment, in relation to the female victim, for a non-parole period of three years and nine months and the balance of the term of sentence being three years and nine months. That sentence commenced twelve months after the sentence for aggravated acts of indecency, which, in turn, commenced twelve months after the offence for robbery in company. In relation to the aggravated detain for advantage for the male victim, the same sentence was imposed and it was wholly concurrent with the sentence of the female victim.  
     
      
    58 In relation to the applicant the non-parole period was identical but there was imposed a lesser (by one year and nine months) parole period. In the circumstances faced by the sentencing judge, the finding was made, with respect correctly, that the offences of detain for advantage should result in a sentence imposed upon the co-offender that was greater than that imposed upon the applicant.  
     
      
    59 His Honour the sentencing judge also considered subjective circumstances and found that an extended period of parole supervision was necessary. He stated that he intended to structure the sentences so that “there is scope for a longer effective parole period than would otherwise be imposed but it would be a matter for the Parole Board to assess the utility of allowing the offenders the benefit of this based upon the attitudes that they exhibit in the future.” 
     
      
    60 On the basis of these findings on the involvement in the detain for advantage, it is clear that the instigator of the offences and the person who took the leading role in the offences was the co-offender. In those circumstances, to impose a sentence on the applicant for these offences which, when compared to his co-offender, is identical in the non-parole period imposed but less in the parole period, gives rise to a sense of grievance which, in the circumstances, is justifiable.  
     
      
    61 The difficulty is that the offence is a serious one. To reduce the sentence to a level that brings the law into disrepute is impermissible, even if that requires inappropriate disparity. I intend to maintain the overall sentence and reduce the non-parole period to effect the same ratio as the sentencing judge effected for the co-offender. While this results in a sentence that is lower than would otherwise or ordinarily be justified, it is not so low as to warrant the non-application of the parity principle.  
     
      
       
      Impact on Third Party 
       
      
    62 The remaining ground of appeal raised is the issue associated with the subjective circumstances of the serious illness of the applicant’s infant child. As set out in the judgment of Barr J the principles associated with the mercy to be granted because of the serious impact upon innocent third persons have been established in a number of cases. With the exception of cases such as R v Douglass [2001] NSWCCA 250 (where the circumstances were such that the Court took the view that the applicant was suffering extra curial punishment which could be taken into account), the circumstances in which the effect on third persons will be taken into account by the Court when sentencing are and must remain exceptional. If persons have significant subjective circumstances associated with the need to care for a person, they should be matters that impact upon the decision of the person to offend against the law. They can rarely be circumstances which allow the Court to forgo punishment imposed by the Parliament for the criminal offence in question.  
     
      
    63 Nevertheless, such subjective circumstances may be able to be taken into account more readily in the ratio of non-parole period to the remainder of sentence. In that way, the conduct of the offender will itself determine the success or otherwise of the application for parole and society can continue to exercise supervision over the conduct of the offender in question.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    64 The inconsistent determination of the sentencing judge requires correction. In the circumstances, the determination that the applicant ought be sentenced to the same non-parole period as his co-offender gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. That justifiable sense of grievance requires the Court to exercise its own discretion in relation to the matter. I take into account the principles of parity and my determination of the proper relationship between the offences. I otherwise take into account the findings of his Honour the sentencing judge in every other respect. I add to the special circumstances the situation with the applicant’s child and allow for the circumstance that, if the applicant’s conduct is such as to warrant parole, he would be eligible to return to his child earlier than otherwise contemplated.  
     
      
    65 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be granted in part.  
        
       
       
        
        (b) The sentence imposed on the applicant by his Honour Judge Hulme SC on 10 February 2006 for the offences of aggravated (being in company) detain for advantage (2 counts) be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences be imposed: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) In respect of each of the offences of aggravated detain for advantage the applicant, Brendan John Roberts, be sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years and eleven months that will commence on 15 December 2005 and expire on 14 November 2008 with a remainder of sentence of a further two years and ten months to expire on 14 September 2011.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) The applicant will first be eligible for parole on 14 November 2008.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Joseph Robert Haoui appears for sentence today after having been found guilty of an offence of driving at a speed dangerous to the public whereby grievous bodily harm was occasioned.2 The offender was driving down Frederick Street in Rockdale. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was travelling at at least ninety-one kilometres an hour.3 The reason I am satisfied that that was at least the speed at which he was travelling is because of evidence adduced by the crown at trial from Sergeant Kelly. He concluded from the objective material available to him, with the aid of various measurements and calculations, that 91 kph was the lowest speed at which the offender was travelling.4 As he was heading down Frederick Street, a utility driven by Mr Khanafer pulled out of the driveway at number 89. The passenger in the front seat was a man by the name of Kamal Mousselamani.5 Mr Khanafer said that he saw the offender’s vehicle before he pulled out of the driveway but had not realised it was travelling so fast.6 The offender’s vehicle struck the rear of the utility causing it to spin around. Mr Mousselamani suffered injuries in that collision and he was taken to hospital. It was there discovered that he had a fractured cheekbone. He underwent an operation and the evidence suggested that he has been left with no residual disabilities or impairment.7 Indeed at trial, one of the real issues for the jury to determine was whether Mr Mousselamani had suffered grievous bodily harm. There was evidence that a very short time after this collision he attended his son’s wedding and there played a musical instrument which required him to blow into that instrument.8 I am satisfied that the injuries of course amounted to grievous bodily harm but very much at the low end of that scale.9 The offender was nineteen years of age at the time. He had a number of matters on his driving history including three speeding matters. 10 Since this collision, he has also committed other traffic offences: one more speeding matter and an offence of making an unlawful U-turn.11 However, the offender has no criminal history.12 He was brought up in a supportive family, living with his parents and two younger sisters in the family home. He completed Year 12 and has then undergone further study, initially in the IT area before commencing further study in the hope that he would become a police officer.13 After this collision, it may be that someone told him that he could not become a police officer if he was convicted, or it may be that he felt uncertain himself, and so he discontinued his studies.14 Since then he has begun to work full-time in the family cleaning business. References and other material were tendered to me today which indicate that there is a lot to be said for the offender. He is a hard worker and gets on well with his employees and clients.15 This is, like many cases of this offence which come before the courts, an offence committed by a person who, (in this case, apart from some traffic matters), is a person of otherwise impeccable character.16 He is now twenty-three years old. He was only nineteen when this collision occurred. That four year delay is a matter about which Mr Campbell spoke at length this afternoon. 17 This is a case where the offender has had the matter hanging over his head for that period. It has led to some uncertainty which in turn has led to the offender discontinuing a tertiary education course that he was undergoing, and no doubt the offender has been anxious at the outcome of these proceedings.18 It seems that no part of the delay was attributable to any failure of the offender to appear at court or have his witnesses available or things of that nature. Instead, delay seems to be attributable to three circumstances: the first that the offender was discharged at committal; the second that a trial listed in 2005 was adjourned on application of the crown when its witnesses were not available; and the third when the crown was dilatory in paying the costs thrown away by the offender because of that successful adjournment application.19 The authorities speak of the measure of leniency which can be shown to someone in the offender’s position who has had a matter hanging over him for a lengthy period of time.20 There is, however, one qualification to what I have been saying and that is this. The offender must have known that he was travelling at high speed down Frederick Street. He could not have believed that he was travelling at or close to fifty kilometres an hour, that being the speed limit applicable at the time.21 Although it is an objective test as to whether he was driving dangerously or not, I am satisfied that the offender must have realised that he was driving at a dangerous speed.22 It was always open for the offender to admit his guilt. It may be that he thought he had a chance of getting off, especially given the state of the crown brief until very late. But given what the offender must have known about the way he was driving, a plea of guilty would have obviated the need for these protracted proceedings.23 So there is that qualification, as I have said, to the circumstances which have resulted in this matter being delayed for such a lengthy period of time.24 It is not a case either where the offender is a mature man. This is a man whose life is changing as he grows older, and so a four year delay to him would be felt particularly keenly. At a time when he would be thinking about consolidating his career, settling down, things of that nature, he has had this matter in front of him for a long time.25 I want to also refer to the circumstance that, in some sense, this collision was attributable to the way that Mr Khanafer drove. He did see the offender’s car before he pulled out of the driveway. It is not a case where the collision was solely attributable to the dangerous speed at which the offender was travelling. However, not too much weight can be placed on this circumstance. 26 The offender drove in such a way that he represented a grave risk to people like Mr Khanafer and Mr Mousselamani. Mr Khanafer might be forgiven for thinking that there would be few people travelling on a wet road down Frederick Street at ninety-one kilometres an hour.27 The offender’s decision to drive at such a high speed was a seriously criminal one. This is, as the photographs revealed, a normal suburban street. There are always likely to be people out and about at 5 o’clock in the evening. There will be people pulling out of driveways, as Mr Khanafer was. There will be pedestrians crossing at pedestrian crossings. The decision by the offender to drive at such a high speed, especially on a wet road, must be firmly borne in mind when deciding on the appropriate sentence.28 Of course, attention was paid during sentencing proceedings to the two guideline judgments of R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte & Ors (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. At one stage Jurisic led to some decisions as to whether there was a bright line between momentary inattention or misjudgement on the one hand and abandonment of responsibility on the other. But the better view and the prevailing view now is that there are sometimes cases in the middle. I am satisfied that this is one of them.29 It is certainly not a case of momentary inattention or misjudgement. The decision to drive at ninety-one kilometres an hour was a deliberate one. But nor is this a case where there was anything in the driving itself which indicates that the offender had abandoned responsibility for his actions.30 One thing that Jurisic and Whyte had in common of course was that they were intended to change the way judges imposed sentences for this type of offence. There can be no argument against the proposition that they were intended to increase the level of sentencing for offences of this type.31 When people drive as the offender did there is always a substantial risk of injury or death, and that is why sentences should be imposed which reflect the fact that the offender deliberately chose to run the risk of such injury or death, and which act as a general deterrent to others who might be tempted to run such risks.32 The offender, as I have said, has no prior convictions. There are some qualifications to a finding that he was of prior good character and has good prospects of rehabilitation and they, of course, relate to his driving history. 33 As to whether the offender has shown remorse, there seems to be some contradiction between what the offender told the author of the pre-sentence report and what he told Dr Westmore.34 The pre-sentence report includes these words: 
     
      
      “Mr Haoui disputed that he was speeding at the time of the accident. He regrets the injuries sustained by the elderly man but maintained that it was an accident.” 
      
    35 On the other hand, Dr Westmore’s report suggests that the offender fully accepted the verdict of the jury in this case. 36 According to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I have to make a finding as to whether the offender was remorseful or not. I am satisfied that he is sorry in the sense that he regrets the injury to Mr Mousselamani, but I am not able to find, on the balance of probabilities, that he is remorseful in the sense that he accepts that that was because of the way he was driving.37 This is a matter where the offence could have been dealt with at the Local Court. It seems that the DPP made a decision that the matter would be committed to this court if it was to go ahead.38 I am not quite sure why that was the case. It seems to be a matter eminently suitable for the Local Court, especially given the very limited nature of the injuries suffered by Mr Mousselamani. Had that happened, the delay of four years would have certainly not been experienced.39 I should make a specific finding that there are no aggravating matters as set out in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act present in this case.40 Mr Campbell submitted that I would not be able to find that a sentence of imprisonment was required in this case.41 Section 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act reproduces in statutory form a principle which has bound sentencing judges for many years, that is, that imprisonment is a sentence of last resort.42 Notwithstanding that, I am satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment is required in this case.43 There is a fundamental rule of sentencing which says that a sentence imposed has to reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. Here, as I have mentioned a couple of times, the offence was objectively grave because the offender willingly and deliberately put other people at risk by travelling at high speed on a wet road where people were likely to be out and about. That deliberate decision can only be met, I am satisfied, with a sentence of imprisonment.44 Mr Campbell, as a fallback position to his primary submission, said that I should suspend the sentence I will impose. Because the sentence I have in mind is less than two years, suspension is an option. However, I am not satisfied that in this case suspension adequately reflects the offender’s conduct and adequately would act as a deterrent to others who may be tempted to drive as the offender did.45 I find special circumstances in this case, this being the first sentence of imprisonment imposed on the offender and the fact that his speeding matters suggest that an extended period of supervision on parole would be of benefit to him.46 I will not, however, impose a sentence of full-time custody. The offender is, as I have said, a man about which it can be said that he has a lot to contribute to society. He is an industrious and hardworking young man, and I am satisfied that the appropriate sentence is one of periodic detention.47 The order I make is therefore this. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of nine months with a head sentence of eighteen months, that sentence to be served to be way of periodic detention.48 The offender is therefore to attend the Parramatta Periodic Detention Centre at 8.30am on 5 May 2007 in order to commence serving his sentence.49 I also disqualify the offender from driving for a period of eighteen months. That is reduced from the automatic period of three years because of the offender’s need to have his licence in order to most efficiently carry out his current occupation.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Elle Saliba has been on s 11 bail [s.11 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999] since 14 December 2006. Initially he was given bail in the face of two committals for sentence. The first related to a break and enter building and commit the offence of stealing. And secondly, in respect of a number of counts of disposing of stolen property.2 At the time it was clear to me that he had a problem with drugs and that he had a problem perhaps in facing up to issues. 3 He was forty-four years old and had not previously been convicted of any offence, if my memory serves me correctly. Certainly he had not been in prison before. 4 The s.11 bail that I gave him was to last for a year. It had a number of conditions that sought to treat what I thought were the causes of his crime and further conditions that would guarantee the protection of the community. 5 Those, which were designed to treat the causes of his criminal offending related to rehabilitation efforts touching drug abuse. He was required to submit to random testing four times a month at the discretion of the Probation and Parole Service. He was required to attend random urine testing within four hours of being notified by the Probation and Parole Service. He was required to accept the supervision and, in particular, counselling by the Probation and Parole Service. 6 To guarantee the protection of the community the Probation and Parole Service were required to advise me of any breach of bail within forty-eight hours. I had also set two dates, this being the first and the date in August being the second, when I would assess his progress before finalising the matter on 14 December this year.7 At the first review I have been given a breach report. It concerns his conduct during urine analysis. He was sent for analysis on 26 March 2007; the urine analysis provider contacted the Service on the 29th, that is, the Probation and Parole Service on 29 March to inform that Service that Mr Saliba had been detected substituting someone else’s urine for his. That was an act, which really undermined any confidence that I could place in the testing. 8 He tells me though that he has made progress whilst he has been on bail. His solicitor indicates that he is now receiving psychological counselling. That he is about to be introduced to a medication regime. 9 In the absence of rehabilitation this is an offence that must call for imprisonment. I am loath, if I can avoid it, to send anyone to prison. What I intend to do is to give him another four months to see if he can redeem himself in the eyes of the Court. In the event that there should be any breach of the bond, you have heard the crown submissions. I thought they were responsibly made. On the next occasion I will not resist them.OFFENDER: Can I say something.HIS HONOUR: Yes.OFFENDER: If it pleases the court to show that part of that deception ..(not transcribable).. I’d be more than willing to go and take out at my own expense have a blood test done randomly when ever Probation and Parole call for out of my own cost to show them there’s no way of cheating through having a blood test.HIS HONOUR: Well that something you can take up with your solicitor. Whatever you do to impress the court will be noted, but I am not making any order.OFFENDER: Yes your Honour..HIS HONOUR: I want to see you at the Penrith District Court for a further progress report on 31 May.OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.ADJOURNED TO PENRITH DISTRICT COURT ON THURSDAY 31 MAY 2007BAIL CONTINUED

    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    Introduction1 Mr Shane Holten was convicted by a magistrate of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. He now seeks to bring an appeal in this Court against the conviction, and also the sentence imposed by the magistrate following that conviction. Such an appeal is commonly referred to as an “All Grounds Appeal”. 2 However when the notice of appeal was filed in this Court the ground of appeal was stated as “I am appealing the above sentence because the penalty is too severe”. Such an appeal is commonly referred to as a ""Severity Appeal”. What Mr Holten seeks now is that I make orders to enable him to pursue an All Grounds Appeal despite the fact that this matter commenced in this Court as a Severity Appeal.3 I will refer to Mr Holten as the appellant.The Merits4 At once it should be noted that this is a case where if I can do what the Appellant seeks, then I should clearly do it. The affidavit filed in support of the Appellant’s Notice of Motion revealed that he, and his legal representative, always intended that the appeal to this Court would include an appeal against his conviction, but through administrative error the form was filled in in such a way as to indicate only an appeal against severity of the sentence. 5 Further the prosecution was alerted to the mistake some time ago, and there is no suggestion that the prosecution would be in any way prejudiced if the Severity Appeal were now converted to an All Grounds Appeal.6 In circumstances where the prosecution suffers no prejudice, this is not a case where the Appellant should be lightly denied the chance to have his conviction overturned because of an administrative error made by those representing him.7 Thus, as I have said, if I can grant the relief which the Appellant seeks, I should do so. The question is, however, whether I have the power to do what the Appellant asks me to.Chronology8 The Appellant was convicted in the Local Court on 16th August 2006. The hearing had taken place a few days earlier on 11th August 2006. The Notice of Appeal was signed by a solicitor from the Aboriginal Legal Service, apparently a solicitor not familiar with the Appellant’s matter. As I have already noted the only ground of appeal stated on that Notice of Appeal concerned the severity of the penalty. That Notice of Appeal was filed in the District Court Criminal Registry on 13th September 2006 and a listing date of 28th September 2006 was allocated.9 On 28th September 2006 there was no appearance of the Appellant nor anyone representing him. The matter was thus stood over to 19th of October 2006 and fresh notices were issued.10 On 19th October 2006 the appellant was represented by Mr Carroll. It was he who had appeared for the Appellant in the Local Court and it was he who had received instructions from the Appellant to lodge an appeal against conviction. 11 It was also Mr Carroll who asked the Aboriginal Legal Service to lodge an appeal on behalf of Mr Holten. However he did not see the Notice of Appeal before it was filed and it was only when his attention was drawn to the fact that no one appeared on 28th September 2006 that he subsequently appeared for Mr Holten on 19th October 2006. 12 It seems at this stage that Mr Carroll became aware of the administrative mistake which led to a Severity Appeal being lodged instead of an All Grounds Appeal. 13 A transcript of what occurred before Acting Judge Gibson on the 19th October 2006 was provided to me. Mr Carroll told his Honour,  
     
      
       
      “what has occurred is that Mr Holten’s appeal was filled out by the ACLO, the Aboriginal Legal Service, the liaison officer, and said it was a Severity Appeal. The intention of Mr Holten was for this matter to be an All Ground Appeal.”  
      
    14 The Judge directed that there be a transcript taken out (transcripts are not usually provided for Severity Appeals but are of course necessary for All Grounds Appeals) and asked Mr Carroll  
     
      
      “is he in time or have you got to make an application for leave?”  
       
      
    15 Mr Carroll replied, 
     
      
       
      “I think the distinction between a Severity Appeal and an all ground appeal is merely administrative. Once the appeal’s in it is sufficient, so no”. 
       
      
    16 It is to be noted that at 19th October 2006 the time limit of 28 days specified in s11 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act (“the legislation”) had expired but it was within the 3 month period referred to in s13 of that Act. If Mr Carroll had made an application for leave to appeal against the Appellant’s conviction when he appeared before Judge Gibson on 19th October 2006 it is unlikely that that would have been opposed and the issue which I now have to determine would not have arisen. 17 Various call overs of the matter then took place until the matter was listed for the hearing of an application for leave to appeal on the 2nd April 2007. Before that date the DPP was served with the Notice of Motion and affidavit in support of the Notice of Motion seeking, as I have mentioned earlier, that “the grounds of appeal be amended from Severity to an All Grounds Appeal”.Arguments of the Appellant18 It is the Appellant’s case that an application to amend the appeal from a Severity Appeal to an All Grounds Appeal was made orally by Mr Carroll when he appeared before Judge Gibson on 19th October. Mr Franklin, who appears for the Appellant at this stage, referred to the fact that when that application was being made it was outside the 28-day period referred to in s11 but within the 3-month period referred to in s13. It was implicit in Mr Franklin’s submission that it was his understanding of the law that the application to convert an appeal from severity to all grounds had to be made within the 3 month period. As will appear, I do not agree that that is correct. 19 Mr Franklin submitted that an application to amend grounds of appeal did not have to be in writing but even if it did then he relied on s62. He said that this was beneficial legislation and should be given a beneficial interpretation. 20 He pointed out that on 19th of October there was no objection taken by the Crown to Mr Carroll’s suggestion that the appeal could be converted without leave being sought and if there had been such an objection then leave to appeal could have been sought at a time within the 3 month cut off referred to in s13.Arguments - Crown21 The Crown argument is that changing an appeal from severity to all grounds is not simply a case of amendment, but it is the bringing of a completely new and different form of appeal. The Crown submitted that if Mr Franklin’s argument was correct then all Severity Appeals could be amended to All Grounds Appeals at any time whether within the 28 day period, within the 3 month period, or even outside that 3 month period. 22 The Crown pointed to the requirement that there be grounds of appeal included in writing on the Notice of Appeal and suggested that an amendment to those general grounds of appeal should also be in writing. 23 The Crown argument is that severity and conviction appeals are 2 separate sorts of appeals so a failure to include in a Severity Appeal a ground relating to conviction cannot be rectified simply by amendment and that a fresh Notice of Appeal should have been filed on the 19th October (leave being necessary to do so). The Crown’s argument is summarised in the proposition that there are 2 separate appeals provided for, one relates to severity and one relates to conviction and one can’t be amended to become the other.The Legislation24 Part 3 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides for appeals to this Court from a decision of the Local Court. S11(1) provides  
     
      
        
       
      “any person who has been convicted or sentenced by a Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the conviction or sentence”.  
      
    25 By subsection 2 that appeal must be made within 28 days after sentence is imposed. 26 S14(2) requires that the Notice of Appeal must state “the general grounds of appeal”.27 S20 sets out what the District Court may do after hearing an appeal, with different outcomes available depending on whether the appeal is one against conviction or one against sentence.28 Importantly the legislation allows Notices of Appeal to be amended. S62(2) provides that an Appeal Court hearing an appeal may amend a Notice of Appeal if it is satisfied that the Notice is capable of amendment and ought to be amended.29 There are some matters of note in the legislation. First s11 doesn’t make specific provision for a single appeal against both conviction and sentence. It is the experience of this Court that often a Notice of Appeal is filed which states that the ground of appeal is that the appellant is not guilty, but when that appeal is dismissed a challenge is then made to the sentence imposed by the magistrate. In such circumstances the practice has been to hear the sentence aspect of the appeal after (either explicitly or implicitly) allowing amendment of the Notice of Appeal to add an additional ground challenging the sentence. If the Crown in the present case is right then such amendment is not permissible where, as in most cases, the time limits have expired. 30 Secondly the same time limit applies to appeals against conviction and appeals against sentence, even to the extent of providing that a conviction appeal cannot be made before sentence is imposed. Thus amending a Notice of Appeal to the effect that the appeal is against conviction rather than sentence does not allow an appellant a back door way to avoid a time limit. Matters of Practice31 Matters of practice need also to be noted. I have already referred to the general practice of allowing a sentence appeal to follow an unsuccessful conviction appeal even if the original Notice of Appeal did not make a specific challenge against the sentence imposed. 32 Another matter of practice concerns the form used by appellants. It seems that there are various versions of this form used by various people and which form is used depends on who the appellant approaches to provide him or her with the form. 33 The version of the form currently available on the Lawlink site is in a slightly different format to the Notice of Appeal in the present case. In other cases, particularly it seems where the appellant is in custody, the form used makes reference to the Justices Act, an Act which was repealed on 7th July 2003 by the Justices Legislation (Repeal and Amendment) Act.34 Even more surprisingly the form currently on Lawlink (and it must be remembered that is the official Attorney General’s website to assist members of the public) to be filled in by those seeking leave to appeal has as its subheading “section 123 Justices Act” and contains references to “Part 4A Justices Act”. In these circumstances it is worth repeating that the Justices Act was repealed almost 4 years ago.35 To return to the Notice of Appeal, the various forms used have other curiosities. For example the form available on Lawlink contains advice to the appellant to cross out those grounds of appeal which are not applicable from a list of 3. The second of those options is “I am appealing the above sentence because the penalty is too severe” (emphasis added) yet nowhere in the form above that entry is there any space for the sentence to be recorded. 36 The form does not appear to be made pursuant to any rule or regulation. Perhaps some attention needs to be paid to it, and to others on lawlink as well. 37 I mention these matters not because they are directly relevant to the resolution of the present appeal but to suggest that to strictly confine an appellant to matters appearing on a Notice of Appeal would seem inconsistent with the lack of rigour with which the various forms of the Notice of Appeal appear to have been drafted.The Purpose of the Legislation38 The legislation has as its purpose the creation and regulation of means to challenge a magistrate’s conviction or sentence. The consequences of not allowing such a challenge can be grave indeed. There are few orders made by an inferior Court which are not susceptible to appeal, because the criminal justice system recognises that not all decisions are perfect and that where error is made it is better to correct it than to ignore it. This is especially the case where the decision which may be wrong is a decision to convict a person of a crime.39 The power of amendment in s62(2) is also to be borne in mind. That provision gives a judge a discretion as to whether to allow an amendment. Thus in interpreting the legislation it is to be noted that the exercise of that discretion controls whether amendments will be made, and giving judges the power to decide whether to allow an amendment is more consistent with the purpose of the legislation than to preclude amendments being made irrespective of the consequences of that outcome.Decision40 In the light of s62(2), which clearly contemplates amendments being made to a Notice of Appeal, the question to be asked in the present case is not whether the amendment sought can be made, but whether it can’t be. 41 The submissions of both the parties seem to have been distracted by what occurred on 19 October and the fact that, at that time, the 3 month period provided for in s13 had not expired. But what happened on 19 October, and s13 are irrelevant to the present matter, because I am satisfied that there is nothing in the legislation which prevents an appellant who has lodged an appeal within the 28 day period provided for in s11 seeking to amend the relevant Notice of Appeal, even to the extent of appealing against conviction where the original Notice of Appeal stated that the appeal was against sentence. 42 To hold otherwise could easily result in an injustice. Indeed an injustice would surely result in this case if the Crown’s argument is correct. The appellant would be denied the opportunity to challenge his conviction because of an error made by his lawyers, and that would be the case even though it was made known to the prosecution from a relatively early stage that an error had been made. 43 An interpretation of the legislation which avoids injustice is to be preferred over an interpretation which does not.44 To accept the Crown’s argument would be to artificially divide the grounds of appeal which are referred to in s14(2) into 2 categories: those where the grounds of appeal relate to a particular aspect of the conviction or sentence challenged; and those where the grounds of appeal identify whether what is challenged is a conviction or a sentence. 45 I will give an example to illustrate what I mean. The Crown did not suggest that if an appellant included in a Notice of Appeal a ground of appeal suggesting that a sentence was challenged because of an asserted failure to take sufficient account of subjective matters, then the appellant would later be precluded from amending the Notice of Appeal to include a challenge to the sentence on the basis that the magistrate had misunderstood the maximum penalty. The Crown accepted that an amendment to grounds of that nature could be made after the 28 day time limit had expired. Why then should a different approach be taken to grounds of appeal which identify whether it is the sentence or conviction which is challenged? The answer of course is that no different approach should be taken because there is not legislative warrant for so doing.46 The result is that this Court has power to amend the grounds of appeal so that the Notice of Appeal covers both conviction and sentence. As I explained earlier, in the circumstances of this case, if this Court has the power to do what the appellant asks it should do so, there being no prejudice to the Crown and no fault on the part of the appellant.47 The Crown no doubt would be concerned, probably justifiably, at an outcome which saw sentence appeals becoming conviction appeals a lengthy time after the appeal was first filed. But nothing in this judgment is intended to suggest that amendments such as that sought here are simply there for the asking. S62(2) is an important constraint and the question of whether an amendment “ought” be allowed will be a matter for consideration by the judge hearing the application. All that I am deciding in this case is whether such amendment can be made and the question of whether it ought to be must be resolved on a case by case basis. 48 The particular relief sought by the appellant includes an order that “the grounds of appeal be amended from Severity to an All Grounds Appeal”. Some greater precision perhaps is necessary so that the order I make reflects the legislation. 49 The order I make is therefore: The Notice of Appeal signed on behalf of the appellant on 24 August 2006 is to be amended to include the following ground of appeal in addition to the ground of appeal presently appearing, “I am appealing the above conviction because I am not guilty”.

    JUDGMENT 
    Admissibility of Officer Kelly’s Evidence1 Joseph Robert Haoui appeared for trial charged with driving at a speed dangerous to another person or persons whereby his vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which grievous bodily harm was occasioned to Kamal Mousselamani. He pleaded not guilty to that charge. The only evidence that the Crown had to establish the speed that the accused was travelling came from a police officer, Sgt John Kelly. Before his evidence was given in the trial proper a voir dire was conducted and I was asked to rule on the admissibility of his evidence. I ruled that his evidence was admissible and he was then called to give evidence before the jury. The jury must have accepted that evidence beyond reasonable doubt in view of verdict they later returned.2 Because I was anxious not to unnecessarily delay the jury any more than it had been, I indicated when announcing my decision to admit the evidence of Sgt Kelly that I would give my reasons for that decision later. These are those reasons.3 Sgt Kelly did not actually attend the location in Frederick St at the time of the collision, although he did go there some considerable time later. Instead he relied on material obtained by other police officers in order to calculate what he said was a conservative value for the speed at which the accused was travelling down Frederick St immediately before he braked in an effort to avoid colliding with the vehicle in which Mr Mousselamani was travelling.4 Sgt Kelly’s evidence was that by obtaining various bits of data and then by putting those into well-accepted equations of motion, it was possible to calculate the speed that the accused was driving. 5 Mr Campbell SC who appeared with Mr Bolster for the accused challenged the admissibility of Sgt Kelly’s calculations and conclusions on a number of bases. He firstly complained about the circumstances in which the evidence that Sgt Kelly could give was made known to him. I have mentioned those circumstances in an earlier judgment. It is sufficient for the purposes of this judgment to note that the first report prepared by Sgt Kelly, and served on the accused, was seriously deficient. It failed to identify why it was that Sgt Kelly had chosen particular values to put into the equations and failed to demonstrate that the equations he used were accepted as a valid method of calculating speed from that data. 6 However the Crown made an effort to overcome those circumstances by the provision of further reports prepared by Sgt Kelly. Those reports were served very late on the accused, indeed the trial had been proceeding for some time before the final report was served on the accused, and that was done a very short time before Sgt Kelly was called to give evidence.7 This hardly a commendable state of affairs but the question as to whether Sgt Kelly’s evidence was admissible does not depend on whether this state of affairs is commendable or not.8 In these circumstances Mr Campbell asked me to exclude the evidence under s137 Evidence Act. He said that there was a danger of unfair prejudice to his client which had come about because of the history I have shortly outlined. Section 137 Evidence Act is usually directed to circumstances in which evidence is put before jury and there is a risk the jury will misuse that evidence, but even if the section can be applied in circumstances such as I have described then I can see no reason for concluding that the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused outweighs the probative value of the evidence. 9 In performing that balancing exercise I must first consider the probative value of Sgt Kelly’s evidence. Once the faults which are apparent in Sgt Kelly’s first report are overcome by the provision of other written material from Sgt Kelly, which was then supplemented by the oral evidence which was given on the voir dire, the basis of Sgt Kelly’s conclusion becomes apparent. He has explained why he chose particular values and the evidence is such that there is now a basis demonstrated for his selection of those values. He has now also demonstrated the validity or at least the general acceptance of the equations he uses in order to come to the conclusion he does.10 When I compare that to the danger of unfair prejudice I note that what Mr Campbell was submitting was that he suffered forensic difficulties because of the late service of the necessary evidence. However when I pressed Mr Campbell in an effort to discover precisely what those forensic difficulties were and more importantly how they prejudiced his client, it became clear to me that any difficulties or prejudice could easily be overcome by adjournments and directions. 11 If Mr Campbell did wish to seek the opinion of his own expert I would have granted him the time to do so. If that required the re-calling of Crown witnesses, again I would have allowed him to do so. Any fear that the jury might hold his client responsible for the subsequent delay could be dealt with by me telling the jury, in forceful terms if necessary, that any delay and inconvenience is solely the responsibility of the prosecution because they had failed to do what they should have done before the trial got underway. I note in passing that I did tell the jury in any case that the reason they had spent so much time out of the Court room while we dealt with legal issues was because of the Crown obtaining and serving information very late. 12 Mr Campbell also submitted that Sgt Kelly’s opinion was also inadmissible because he failed to explain the basis for it. Whether that was the case before the voir dire evidence was completed is one thing, but I am satisfied that once all his reports had been tendered and his evidence given, the basis on which his opinion was formed was fully explained and a proper basis for choosing those values and equations has been shown.13 Sgt Kelly gave evidence that in order to calculate a speed at time of impact he needed to know: the angle at which the vehicles collided; their post impact angle of travel; the distance they travelled after impact; and the coefficient of friction on the road way. He explained why he had chosen the values that he had. The impact angles were estimated from photographs taken by police showing the damage to the vehicles. The mass of the vehicles he obtained from RTA records making allowances for fuel state and the number of passengers. The distance travelled after collision was measured by police who attended the scene of the collision and Sgt Kelly used those figures. He was able to work out the departure angle of travel for each vehicle because he knew from a plan prepared by the police where the vehicles had ended up and he knew from some glass on the roadway where the collision had occurred. In each case Sgt Kelly said that he used conservative values which meant that where there was any margin of error he chose a figure which favoured the accused, that is which underestimated the speed which would ultimately be calculated.14 As far as the coefficient of friction is concerned Sgt Kelly’s estimation of this came in 2 stages. At the time of preparing his first report he had not been to Frederick St but used his experience in analysing motor vehicle collisions to estimate what the coefficient of friction actually was. He knew that visible tyre marks had been left on the roadway which suggested that the coefficient of friction must have been above a certain level otherwise any skid marks would have been invisible to the naked eye. He also knew the nature of the road surface and that the road way was wet. From his years of experience in investigating motor vehicle collisions he was able to estimate a figure for the appropriate coefficient of friction and again he explained he chose a conservative figure, that is one which favoured the accused.15 Some years later, after the police had purchased a particular item of equipment, he went out to Frederick St and actually measured the coefficient of friction. As Mr Campbell pointed out there are a number of differences between the test he did that day and the circumstances which existed at the time of the collision. These differences were all the subject of cross-examination, but Sgt Kelly was able to explain how those different circumstances would have affected the result he obtained and the utility of the coefficient of friction he measured as being a guide to the coefficient of friction which existed at the time of the collision. However the most important aspect of the later test done by Sgt Kelly is that it tended to suggest the accuracy of the figure he had earlier estimated from his experience. That is the coefficient of friction he measured was not more favourable to the accused than the coefficient of friction he had earlier estimated in performing his calculation. 16 Sgt Kelly also explained why he had used the equation which he had to calculate the pre-impact speed, that equation being well recognised in text books devoted to the analysis of motor vehicle collisions.17 Having calculated the pre-impact speed Sgt Kelly was then able to measure the length of the skid marks and, again using the coefficient of friction, calculate the speed the accused’s vehicle was doing at the start of the skid marks. As I have said this speed he calculated as 91 kph. There could be no challenge to a submission that travelling at 91 kph was a dangerous speed in the circumstances. 18 As I have explained Sgt Kelly was able to demonstrate the validity of the values he had chosen, as well as the acceptance of the equations into which those values were put, in order to calculate the speed of the accused’s vehicle.19 Another matter which Mr Campbell suggested would render Sgt Kelly’s evidence inadmissible was a suggested failure to demonstrate any expertise enabling Sgt Kelly to give the evidence he did. I will not delay matters by setting out Sgt Kelly’s history of work and education. It is all set out in the transcript and his reports. It is not to the point that some other person might have more expertise, or might even disagree with the values chosen or the equations used (not that Mr Campbell suggested any of these matters). This is not a case where there was a suggestion made that Sgt Kelly was using untested science or that he was attempting to use equations of motion in circumstances where they had never been used before. I am satisfied that Sgt Kelly’s expertise extended sufficiently such that he had the specialised knowledge or training required in order to provide an opinion which could be acted upon by the jury. 20 Finally Mr Campbell referred to s136 Evidence Act. He said that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial or misleading or confusing and suggested that I could limit the evidence that Sgt Kelly could give. That is not what s136 is directed to. It is directed to the position where the jury would be told that they could not use evidence which had been given in a particular way. It is not directed to preventing the evidence being admitted in the first place.21 The evidence of Sgt Kelly was clearly important and indeed the Crown had no case without it. It is for that reason that a great deal of attention was paid to the admissibility of Sgt Kelly’s evidence and in particular to the validity of the values he chose to put into the equations he used. Having observed the evidence, and having read his reports, I formed a view that his evidence was admissible for the reasons I have just given.

    SENTENCEIntroduction1 The offender appears for sentence today on 15 counts of stealing from his employer, the Australian Museum. He asks also that I take into account a total of 179 other offences on 5 Forms 1 attached to various counts on the indictment. The maximum penalty for each offence on the indictment is imprisonment for 10 years.Facts2 The Australian Museum is Australia’s first and oldest natural history museum, having been established in 1827. As well as having a cultural significance, the collections of the museum are important to natural history research and projects undertaken by staff, students and scientists from external agencies.3 Many people would have visited the Australian Museum and seen the exhibits there in the various galleries. However the work of the Australian Museum extends far beyond displaying exhibits to members of the public. The vast majority of the items held and owned by the museum are not for the purposes of display to the public, but are instead for the purpose of scientific study. 4 The offender started working for the Australian Museum in October 1996. Initially he was working as a pest controller. This work necessarily gave him access to all parts of the Museum. He took advantage of that by stealing the great bulk of the items for which he is to be now sentenced. Later he was transferred to a different position within the Museum as a moulder and caster. This reduced his access to parts of the Museum and so his rate of theft also reduced.5 The offender started stealing from his employer within months of starting work. Museum management first noticed thefts of various specimens in late 1997, however they did not report the matter to the police until late 1998. A police investigation did not commence at that time for reasons that are not clear. 6 Later Dr Tim Flannery made the Museum Trust aware of the thefts. The Museum Trust reported the matter to the ICAC on 3 October, 2002. ICAC began investigations which culminated in the offender’s arrest and the recovery of the things he stole.7 On 11 March, 2003, the day before the offender’s premises were searched, he was observed by ICAC officers to move a large number of specimens stolen from the Australian Museum, from his house, to his daughter’s house. He later admitted that this was “to hide them” .8 On 12, 13 and 17 March, 2003, a number of Search warrants were executed on various premises by ICAC, including the premises of the offender. Later, police officers took possession of further items from the home of the offender. 9 The offender took part in two recorded interviews with ICAC officers on 12 March and 8 May, 2003. The offender admitted that he had stolen a large number of specimens from the Australian Museum during his employment with the Museum. The offender also admitted that, on occasions, he even used an official Museum vehicle to transport the stolen specimens to his home.10 He was fired in March 2003, soon after his arrest.The Major Issue in Dispute11 A great proportion of the evidence called in this matter related to the question of the extent of the damage occasioned by the offender’s wrong-doing. The Crown made its position clear from the outset, namely that the damage caused was substantial. Mr Steirn SC on behalf of the offender made his position clear too from very early on. There was a real dispute concerning the extent to which the offender had caused loss or damage. 12 The Crown said that there were a number of ways in which the offender’s thefts had caused damage. They included: 
     
      
       
       Damage to the items themselves such as the physical damage to the thylacine skull the subject of count two, which included the separation of the teeth from the skull.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       The cost of dealing with pest infestation of the exhibits after they were recovered from the offender’s possession. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       Damage to the individual specimens because of improper storage methods while they were in the offender’s possession. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       The cost of identifying the provenance of each item recovered so that it could be matched with information concerning where and in what circumstances it was taken from its natural environment. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       The loss of information resulting from both damage to the items recovered and also the inability to identify particular exhibits with particular catalogue numbers. 
       Damage to the reputation of the Australian Museum. 
       
      
    13 With the possible exception of the final category, all of these heads of damage were contested by the offender. But for reasons I will explain, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender has caused not merely substantial harm, but enormous, incalculable harm through his criminal activities. Through his selfish actions he has cost the Australian Museum not only a great deal of money, but damaged its reputation, and perhaps most importantly of all, caused permanent harm to the ability of scientists to study many aspects of the natural history of Australia and the rest of the world. In some cases that harm will be permanent. As I was reminded when hearing the evidence, many of the exhibits are unique and irreplaceable. To take the obvious example, there will never be another thylacine skull to replace the one damaged by the offender. 14 I will discuss each of the aspects of such damage in turn, but before I do so I will turn to an assessment of the credit of the various witnesses, including the offender.Credit15 There were a large number of matters in dispute in the present case. They concerned various issues, but one issue remained of relevance to all disputed issues of fact, namely the credit worthiness of the witnesses, including the offender himself. 16 In no area at all was it shown that witnesses called by the prosecution had exaggerated their evidence or lied. The Crown relied in particular on the evidence of three scientists employed by the Museum: Dr Walter Boles, the collection manager of birds: Mr Ross Sadlier, the collection manager in herpetology; and Dr Sandra Ingelby, the collection manager in mammals. It was obvious that the scientists felt ill disposed towards the offender, but that is hardly surprising given the circumstances. Nevertheless such feelings might lead a witness to exaggerate matters or say things which are untrue and so I listened carefully to the evidence to establish whether the attitude of the prosecution witnesses towards the offender could have damaged their credibility. I could identify no area where it was even suggested to them that they had lied. 17 To the contrary is the evidence given by the offender. When a witness comes before the Court, and is shown to have lied, that can damage the credibility of everything else the witness says. This is the case when I consider the offender’s evidence. I am satisfied that he lied to me and so I must look at the rest of his evidence with that in mind. 18 So obvious were some of the offender’s lies in court that his counsel was forced to concede that he had lied, suggesting that his client could not bring himself to admit the truth.19 One of the areas where he most clearly lied concerned his evidence as to the circumstances in which he took the Long Beak Echidna skull, a matter on the Form 1 attached to Count 1. During the offender’s evidence he was shown a copy of a document (exhibit RR). The document was a copy of a notice which was posted around the Museum in an effort to discover the whereabouts of some Long Beaked Echidna skulls which had gone missing. The offender admitted that he had seen the notice around the Museum, but despite that fact, when he came across the one of the missing skulls about a year later, his evidence was that he simply stole it. He didn’t tell anyone in authority that he had found one of the skulls. His attitude was that he had been treated spitefully by someone in the Museum and so when he found the skull he took it. 20 Exhibit RR describes the missing skulls and goes on to explain their rarity and importance. When it was suggested to the offender in cross examination that he therefore knew of the skull’s rarity and scientific significance before he stole it, he gave evidence that he only read the heading and not the rest of the notice.21 This is simply incapable of belief. At the time the notice headed “Missing Skulls” was posted around the museum, the offender was a man who had been stealing skulls, and other items, for some time. It is inconceivable that he would not have read the entirety of that notice rather than simply its heading. 22 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender saw the notice, (he admitted that) and that he read it all (something he denied). That conclusion is important for two reasons in particular. First, as far as the offender’s motivation is concerned it means, even accepting him as to the circumstances in which he took the skull, that he was not taking it to look after it but taking it simply because he wanted it. A person who genuinely wanted to look after such a scientifically valuable and much needed specimen would have taken it to the person who most wanted it. And secondly it means that he lied to me when giving his evidence.23 There are sufficient examples of the offender clearly lying whilst on oath, one of which I have already mentioned and some of which I will later refer to, that I have significant reservations about accepting his evidence on matters in dispute. Bias – Dr Ingelby24 It was constant refrain in Mr Steirn’s submissions to me that I should find that Dr Ingleby was biased against the offender. It is undoubtedly the case that Dr Ingleby is not well disposed to the offender. Given his admitted criminality she, as a scientist who has for many years worked in the study of mammals at the Australian Museum, would have felt the loss and damage occasioned by the offender’s criminal acts deeply. She has had to invest many hours of her time dealing with the consequences of the offender’s crimes. She no doubt would prefer to be doing other work to advance the state of knowledge of mammals rather than spending weeks of her time attempting to minimise the damage the offender has caused. She also recognises that some of the damage can never be undone.25 These ill feelings towards the offender appear to have pre-dated his arrest. The evidence is that she was suspicious of the offender well before his arrest. It would not be surprising therefore if Dr Ingelbey wanted to see the offender punished for what he has done. 26 In those circumstances I have to be careful before I accept Dr Ingleby’s evidence. I have therefore examined her evidence with great care, especially where it conflicts with the evidence of the offender. 27 I prefer Dr Ingleby’s evidence, to the extent of being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt concerning it, even where it does conflict with the evidence of the offender. Dr Ingleby’s evidence was consistent, both internally and with other evidence called by the Crown; she made appropriate concessions, conceding that she was not an expert in areas where she was not an expert; and, unlike the offender, was not found to be lying despite extensive cross-examination by Mr Steirn.Antipathy displayed by museum staff28 The offender gave evidence that he experienced jealousy and antipathy from more highly qualified members of the Museum staff. He said that he felt ostracised and although he contributed money for the purchase of birthday cakes for staff, no one ever collected money for a cake for him. The offender should not have been surprised by this. He was under suspicion for a long period of time. Many believed him to be responsible for the high rate at which specimens were going missing. Scientists who had devoted a great part of their professional lives to the study of specimens such as those they believed the offender was stealing were unlikely to be terribly keen to buy the offender a birthday cake. 29 Mr Whittaker was a volunteer at the museum who was called to give evidence on behalf of the offender. He observed that some of the professional staff at the Museum did not treat the offender terribly well. Mr Whittaker of course did not know that by the time he made this observation the offender had been stealing many items from the Australian Museum over a lengthy period of time, with suspicion attaching to the offender himself. It would not be surprising if, in those circumstances, some people were not well disposed towards the offender.30 Thus there is evidence of antipathy being displayed by some museum staff towards the offender for some time. As I have explained such feelings may be justified in the circumstances, but they are relevant to my assessment of the reliability of evidence of museum staff who gave evidence before me. As with Dr Ingelby, it would not be surprising if museum staff wanted to see the offender punished for what he has done. 31 I have therefore examined the evidence of those witnesses employed by the museum with particular care, but once again I could identify no area of their evidence which was unreliable. If it was to be suggested that they had lied I would have expected that to be put to them clearly. But what happened in this case is that contradictions between their evidence and the evidence of the offender became apparent only in the offender’s evidence.32 The witnesses from the museum gave their evidence in a way which impressed me. They all seemed to me to be anxious to be accurate, even to the extent of Dr Boles returning to court one day to correct a relatively minor matter in his earlier evidence. Their evidence was, as with that of Dr Ingelby, internally consistent, consistent with other evidence, and contained nothing which was difficult to accept or incapable of belief.33 The same can not be said of the offender’s evidence as I have explained, and will explain, elsewhere in these remarks.Damage34 Having discussed the credit of some of the important witnesses I will return to the question of damage occasioned by the offender’s thefts.Damage By Removal Of Numbers35 Each specimen held by the Museum has a registered number. The registered number of each item in the Museum’s collection is now collected in an electronic database. This database has records going back to the middle of the 19th Century. Initially the registered numbers were recorded in large leather bound binders before being transferred into the electronic database in more modern times. 36 The registered numbers are identified with particular specimens in various ways, depending on the nature of the specimen. Sometimes the number is actually written on the specimen, sometimes a numbered tag is attached to the specimen, and on other occasions the specimen is kept in a box or other container with the number written on the container. 37 The scientists called by the Crown gave evidence that when an item is disassociated from its registered number, the scientific value of that specimen is greatly diminished, not only as a research animal but also as an archival animal. As Dr Boles explained specimens are not examined only once and then forgotten. It is important that where some research on particular specimens is published, later scientists who wish to examine that research can go back to the identical specimen.38 When an item is acquired by the Museum the provenance of the item is recorded. This includes information such as the location from which the item was taken, when it was taken, and the habitat in which the animal lived. A particular specimen is linked with information regarding its provenance through the registered number. The scientific value of an item is greatly diminished where its provenance is not known. I will illustrate this proposition later in these remarks by referring to the situation which now faces the Australian Museum as far as its study of Marsupial Moles is concerned, but for the present it is important to simply note that where an item has become disassociated from its number the scientific value of that item is greatly diminished because important information regarding the item is lost.39 Amongst other issues, Dr Flannery’s evidence explained the importance of an item being associated with its registered number. His evidence was put before me by tender of his statements. He was not required for cross-examination, so I can accept what he said without reservation. This is what he said in exhibit L. 
     
      
      “To my knowledge, the thefts from the Australian Museum represent the largest theft of Museum holdings ever perpetrated in Australia. The thefts have dealt an irreparable blow to the scientific utility of the Museum’s collections, particularly as some of the specimens have had identifying marks removed or have been separated from accompanying records. This has resulted in the true provenance of many of the recovered specimens being erased and the integrity of the scientific research conducted with these specimens had been compromised. 
      
     
     
      
      Natural history collections are apparatuses that are used by scientists to understand the natural world. All research dealing with classification is entirely dependent upon them. Such studies reveal the full biodiversity of our planet, and are fundamental to all other work in natural science, including conservation, physiology, earth history and some medical research, to name just a few. It is the collection in its entirety, as much as individual items, that is central to this work. This is because every specimen represents a discrete datum point, and it is by accumulating and interpreting these datum points over decades and centuries that pictures of animal and plant distributions, declines and spreads, as well as their evolution, can be tracked. To lose specimens from collections such as the Australian Museum’s, or to break the link between a specimen and the data associated with it (for example by erasing registration numbers) compromises the work of hundreds of researchers conducted over centuries, as well as degrading the investment of many millions of dollars made by individuals and the state in accumulating collections”. 
      
    40 The Crown case is that the offender caused many of the items he stole to become disassociated with their numbers in various ways. He was said to have removed tags, to have taken items from their containers and to have removed numbers that were written on the items themselves.41 When some of the items were seized by ICAC from the offender’s possession it was discovered that the identifying number had been removed by physical means, that is it had been scratched off. The offender denied that he was the person who had done that but it was the Crown case that he had. There was no suggestion that the numbers had been removed when they were in the possession of the Australian Museum, nor would there be any reason for anyone connected with the Museum to have done so. When I asked Mr Steirn during the course of submissions if he could identify anyone apart from his client who would have a motive for removing a number, he conceded that he could think of no-one. In further submissions he conceded that his client must have been responsible for the physical removal of those numbers. I find beyond reasonable doubt therefore that numbers were removed by the offender. This finding has multiple relevance. 42 Firstly it effects the offender’s credibility. He said that he had not removed the numbers but I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had. I find that the offender lied to me when giving his sworn evidence. 43 Secondly it makes it clear that the offender was responsible for the loss of value occasioned by the physical damage to the items and for any associated costs with the repatriation or re-association of the specimen with its associated number.44 Thirdly it also affects my assessment of the offender’s evidence that he was such an avid, even fanatical, collector of specimens that he would not knowingly damage them. In view of my finding that the offender deliberately damaged the items by physically removing numbers on occasions I cannot accept that he is the sort of person who would never knowingly damage a specimen. 45 As it turns out most of the items the subject of the charges on the indictment, or which relate to the matters on the form 1, were able to be re-associated with the registration number assigned to the item by the Australian Museum. This is not surprising because it was that ability to identify a particular item as having come from the Australian Museum’s collection which enabled the prosecution to identify an item found in the offender’s possession as being one stolen from the Museum and thus could be either the subject of a charge or a matter taken into account. 46 Sometimes this was a matter of good fortune, where particular measurements taken earlier when the item was studied when it was in the possession of the Australian Museum enabled that item to be recognised. Thus its unique identifying number could be re-associated with the particular specimen. 47 Sometimes re-association was a matter of painstaking work done by the Australian Museum. 48 And on occasions, particularly with the bird specimens, the link could be made because the offender had attached to some exhibits his own unique identifying number and kept a record of the original Australian Museum number which could be cross referenced after the items were recovered. Cost of Repatriating Items With Numbers49 As part of the damage caused by the offender’s actions, the Crown relies on the time spent by Museum staff as they attempted to reassociate items recovered from the offender with the Museum’s registered number. 50 Dr Boles gave evidence about the time that he had spent on identifying specimens seized from the offender. Dr Boles, who was concerned only with the bird specimens, said that he had spent from 2 - 4 days a week for over a month and a half on that exercise, thus far only looking at skins of specimens and that he had not even started on eggs or skeletons. It will be recalled that Dr Boles had the advantage of the record kept by the offender which enabled cross referencing between the number he gave to the bird skins with the museum’s number.51 Dr Ingleby gave evidence that she and other scientists spent 3 months going through the material recovered from the offender, spending 3 or 4 days a week and 6 or 7 hours a day on that task. Even now, she has not finished her work in attempting to re-associate mammal specimens with their registered numbers.Some Exhibits Have Been Re-Identified With Their Numbers52 I will give some examples where re-association has been possible. The Rhinoceros Horn Bill skull (which is matter number 18 on the Form 1 relating to count 7) was re-associated with its number because it was a distinctive specimen. It was recovered in the same condition it was when it was stolen by the offender, therefore the scientific value of that item has not been diminished. That is of course not to say that the theft of the item did not cause any damage. Clearly the time taken to identify the item and re-associate it with its registered number represented a loss to the Australian Museum in that the scientist who did this work, Dr Boles, was unable to do other work for which he was employed by the Museum. There are many other examples where the Museum employees have had to spend their time reassociating specimens with numbers.53 On other occasions re-attribution was possible because of the uniqueness of the exhibit. For example the Bulmer’s Fruit Bat the subject of Count 13 and the Thylacine the subject of count 2 on the indictment.54 However that does not mean that there had been no loss of scientific value in relation to many of the items recovered. For example the reattribution of unique number to a particular item has not always been done with 100% certainty and for many items there remains some doubt. And on other occasions a large number of similar items were recovered and it has not been possible to ascribe particular unique numbers to particular items. The loss of scientific value caused by this circumstance is illustrated by the position with the Marsupial Mole.The Marsupial Moles55 As I said earlier, when studying specimens taken from the wild, it is crucial to be able to identify when, where, and in what circumstances items in the collection were taken from their natural environment. Dr Ingleby gave an example relating to Marsupial Moles which illustrated the importance of being able to identify the provenance of items which come into the museum’s collection. (The theft of one of the marsupial moles is count 5 on the indictment)56 Her evidence was: 
     
      
      Q. Take the marsupial moles. You’ve got five that you’ve spoken about in your statement. Is there a difficulty in identifying which mole is which mole…? 
      
     
     
      
      A. Yes that’s right. At this point we’re unable and I doubt in future whether we’ll be able to reassign those registration numbers to the moles for the reason that they were spirit specimens, you can’t write a number on them like you can a bone so you can’t use forensics to get it back. They had a tag on them or usually two tags, one on each leg. That number’s been cut off and we have absolutely no way, there were no measurements of those specimens that were ever made. They’re one of the most difficult mammals to obtain in Australia because they burrow and there’s very little known about them. They’re a highly interesting species because at present - we used to think there was just one species in Australia but now molecular research has shown that there could be two or three different species. But we have no way of assigning those numbers back to them and the specimens came from different parts of Australia. Some came from South Australia, some came from Northern Territory and they were also collected often decades apart and we have no way, at this point, of ever matching them back. 
      
    57 So, as far as the Museum’s collection of marsupial moles in concerned, further study in an effort to identify whether there are different species living in different parts of Australia is impossible because there is no way of knowing where any particular marsupial mole came from.The Problems of Re-Association58 Exhibit MM sets out the position regarding the inability to conclusively identify 32 mammal specimens. I have already explained why it is important for a scientist to be able to identify a physical specimen as having been collected from a particular location at a particular time. Mr Steirn accepted the accuracy of the Crown’s submissions on this aspect. Thus it can be immediately seen that the damage as a result of the inability to specifically identify recovered specimens is significant indeed. 59 That damage is both monetary, for example there is a considerable cost of identifying particular exhibits through scientific analysis including perhaps DNA analysis, and also non-monetary through the diminution of the scientific value of an exhibit because anyone studying it cannot be certain of its provenance.The Offender’s Responsibility for Dissociation of the Numbers60 When Dr Boles, Dr Ingleby and Mr Sadlier gave evidence they were cross-examined, but not once was it put to them that before the items were taken by the offender their numbers had been disassociated from them. Yet when the offender gave evidence that is exactly what he said. (I should mention here that his is not the only example where a suggestion was made by the offender in his evidence but that suggestion had not been put to witnesses for their comment). The cross-examination of the 3 scientists was rather focused on suggestions that the Museum should have measured or photographed items to aid repatriation of the registered number. 61 I do not accept as a reasonable possibility the offender’s belated suggestion that the numbers were already disassociated from items when he stole them. Many of the items stolen were of extraordinary scientific interest and it is frankly inconceivable that they would have been treated in such a way whilst at the Museum that their numbers were disassociated. There was no scientific reason for that to happen, and, especially in the case of the more important items, unlikely in the extreme that it would have occurred though negligence. 62 On the other hand the offender, it must be remembered, had a most powerful motive to remove numbers from items he had stolen because those numbers could be used to trace the items back to the Australian Museum. That would explain why, as far as the birds are concerned, the offender removed the Australian Museum’s identification and replaced it with his own. 63 The offender gave evidence that he would only take a numbered tag off a skin when he replaced it with a different number. When asked why he would do this the offender said that the original Australian Museum numbers were long and he preferred that the items have a shorter number. This explanation, I am satisfied, is fanciful and dishonest. The museum’s registered numbers were only a few digits longer than the numbers used by the offender. 64 Count 7 relates to a Ganges River Dolphin. When taken from the Museum both the skull and skeleton were together but when found by ICAC the skeleton was at the offender’s premises whilst the skull was in Newcastle. The offender explained that he gave the skeleton to his friend Richard Kolomy because it had an Australian Museum number on the box in which it was contained. He said didn’t want that box at his home because he was concerned that police were closing in on him. This is clear evidence of the offender’s concern that the registered number could be used to incriminate him and of his consequent desire to remove Australian Museum numbers from exhibits.65 In circumstances where the only person who had any reason to disassociate an item from its number was the offender and where the people at the Australian Museum had every reason to keep an item with its number, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the person responsible for the disassociation of numbers from exhibits was the offender. 66 In some circumstances I am satisfied that the offender physically scratched the number off, or at least attempted to. In other cases I am satisfied that he removed tags. In other cases he took items from a container which had the number on it and finally the offender has attempted to remove numbers through bleaching.67 Let me give some examples of items where the number has been scraped off it, thus physically damaging the item as well as disassociating the item from its registered number.68 When giving evidence, the offender was shown a photograph of a skull of a Bridled Nailtail Wallaby. (The theft of this item appears on the Form 1 attached to Count 2 on the indictment.) It was apparent that someone had scraped off the number previously appearing on the skull. In the course of submissions Mr Steirn virtually conceded that it must have been his client who scraped the number off that item, there being no other reasonable explanation as to how the number came to be removed. The offender was given the opportunity of identifying a reason that anyone apart from him would scratch the number off - the only explanation he could come up with made no sense at all. 69 Exhibit TT was a photograph of a Huon Tree Kangaroo skull. It also had its number scraped off. (The Huon Tree Kangaroo appears on the Form 1 attached to the first count on the indictment) The offender also denied scraping that number off, but I am satisfied that he did. 70 Similarly exhibit UU is a photograph of the Goodfellows Tree Kangaroo (the subject of Count 4 on the indictment). It also had its identifying number removed although there are areas on the bones which show where the number previously appeared.Whether the Australian Museum Should Have Recorded Identifying Data71 In his evidence the offender blamed the Australian Museum for being unable to repatriate some items with registered numbers. He seemed to suggest that the Australian Museum should have measured, photographed, and otherwise recorded identifying information of items either at the time they were received, or subsequently. The offender’s case is that had the Museum done this then the disassociation of items with their registered number would have been of little consequence. Thus he says that the fact that some items cannot be reassociated with their number is not his fault but the Museum’s. 72 The un-stated suggestion behind that evidence is that the offender should get a lesser sentence because he is not wholly responsible for that aspect of the damage related to the disassociation of numbers from items. 73 I reject that completely. It is akin to saying that someone who breaks into a person’s home and steals valuable jewellery should get a lesser sentence where the householder has not put bars across the windows, on the basis that the householder is partly responsible for his or her loss. Offer to Assist the Repatriation 74 In the course of his evidence, the offender said that he was prepared to assist officers from the Australian Museum in their efforts to repatriate items with their numbers. There was no evidence to establish whether he could be of any substantial assistance. In any case I cannot imagine that any sensible officer of the Australian Museum would feel comfortable letting the offender any where near the items which he once stole. His offer of assistance, even if it were capable of being genuine assistance, was fanciful. Physical DamageDamage Caused During Recovery Process75 A significant amount of time was devoted to evidence concerning the issue of whether items recovered from the offender’s possession were damaged in that process of recovery. The offender says that he saw ICAC officers overloading cardboard boxes which contained Australian Museum items they had seized from his and his daughter’s premises. Even assuming that this is the case (and I make no finding that it is) it has to be said that the offender cannot escape responsibility for such damage simply by saying he did not directly cause it. 76 Of course it was foreseeable that in the course of recovering stolen items from him, one or more of them might be damaged. The need for ICAC officers to raid his premises and seize the things the offender stole; the need for them to return items to the Australian Museum; and the need for them to be used in his prosecution, were all eminently foreseeable. 77 This was not a case either where the offender stole only one or two items. Instead he stole a huge number of them which was always going to make recovery of them by police officers, untrained in the handling of natural history specimens, something of a problem. But the circumstance (if it be one) that the offender did not directly cause damage is not really of any great interest where the plain fact remains that were it not for the offender’s stealing the items, thus necessitating their recovery, the items would not have been damaged.The Thylacine Skull (Count 2)78 I am now going to spend some time discussing what I consider the most serious count on the indictment, Count 2. 79 When the thylacine skull was recovered its teeth had come away from the skull. The offender, to his credit, was able to identify the teeth associated with the skull and later experts were able to replace some, but not all, of the teeth in the skull. Quite clearly the thylacine skull is an important scientific item and if it were damaged as a result of the offender’s actions it would be a substantial matter of aggravation.80 Exhibited before me was a photograph of the skull taken in the 1960’s or 1970’s showing the teeth intact. (The photograph is part of exhibit E). Dr Ingleby gave evidence that she catalogued the Australian Museum thylacine skulls, including the one the subject of count 2 on 2nd June 1997 and the teeth were intact when she did so. However something has occurred between that date and the date it was recovered by ICAC from the offender’s premises to cause the teeth to come away from the skull. This is unlikely to have occurred merely through the passage of time - Dr Ingleby’s evidence was that the teeth would have to be wrenched out to effect their removal. If that were done deliberately then that would be an act of gross vandalism, and whatever could be said about the offender, it was never suggested that he would deliberately damage an item in that way. 81 The offender’s evidence was that when he took the skull from the Museum the teeth were in a brown paper bag. It is his case that the skull must have been subject to rougher than usual handling by someone in the Museum before it was stolen by him. On the other hand the Crown case is that the only explanation for the teeth coming away from the skull is that after it was stolen by the offender, a cast was made of it, and in the process of that occurring, the teeth were accidentally removed, perhaps when they became stuck to casting material. 82 Relevant to this dispute is evidence that the offender was also in possession of a cast of the skull, that cast showing the teeth in place. The offender claimed that he got it indirectly from a vet at Bankstown although a witness called by the Crown, Mr Stanioch, gave evidence that the offender told him that the cast was one that the Australian Museum no longer required. 83 There was also evidence also was that it was impossible to distinguish between a cast made from the original skull and a cast taken from a cast. 84 A further matter to note is that Dr Ingleby refused to allow the skull to be cast by the offender when she was approached by him requesting access to the thylacine skulls in the possession of the Australian Museum so that he could copy them. She also refused a request by another man, Peter Ampt, who asked for her permission to have thylacine skulls cast when Dr Ingleby learnt that it was the offender who was to make the casts.85 This evidence is relevant for 2 purposes. Firstly it shows that the cast in evidence before me was unlikely to have been made between 1997 and when it was stolen by the offender. And secondly it is relevant because it established an interest on the part of the offender in casting the skull, making it more likely that once he had come into possession of the skull through his illegal activities, he would do that which he could not do when the skull was in the possession of the Australian Museum: namely take a cast of it. 86 Finally on this issue I should refer to evidence suggesting that the offender was skilled at making moulds and casts of skulls and bones. This tends to suggest that, if the teeth were removed in the process of copying a skull then it was unlikely that the offender was the person performing the exercise. 87 I have considered very carefully what could have happened to the skull to cause the teeth to be removed from it. As I have already said it would be an act of vandalism to do this deliberately. However I consider it entirely possible that during the process of casting the skull the teeth could have been accidentally removed. Some casting material could have stuck to the teeth when the mould was taken and when that mould was removed it is entirely possible that the teeth would have come out with the moulding material. If that were the case then a cast taken from the mould would show the teeth intact. 88 The matter has not been easy to resolve, but I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the skull was damaged after it was stolen by the offender and that that damage most likely occurred in the process of it being copied. I am unable to say beyond reasonable doubt whether it was the offender or some other person who accidentally damaged the skull in the process of copying it but it does not matter as it was the offender’s criminal actions in removing the skull from a place of safety in the Museum which led to it being copied which, as I have said, led to it being damaged by the teeth being removed. 89 I summarise briefly why I have reached that conclusion. The offender expressed an interest in copying the Thylacine skull the subject of Count 2. He was denied permission to do so when the skull was in the possession of the Australian Museum. Thus it is consistent with his expressed interest that once he had stolen the skull he would take a cast of it. There is no reason that anyone would deliberately damage the skull by removing the teeth, yet there is evidence that the teeth could be removed accidentally during the process of casting it. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt therefore that the only explanation for the teeth being removed from the skull is that someone accidentally caused the teeth to be removed while casting the skull, this occurring after the offender had stolen it. 90 The result is that Count 2 is particularly serious. The offender has irreparably damaged an irreplaceable item of great scientific interest. Of less importance is the fact that the Museum staff had to spend time identifying the item as being one which belonged to the Museum. Money was spent in attempting to re-insert the lost teeth. But these damages are much less serious than the unquantifiable but nevertheless substantial harm caused to the study of Australia’s natural history through the skull being damaged.Damage to Items Whilst in the Offender’s Possession91 A number of items appear to have been damaged by improper storage methods used by the offender. For example Dr Boles spoke of skin specimens that were packed excessively tight so that their shape changed and items that were kept in poor quality and insufficient ethanol which led to the items macerating.Bleach92 Many of the items were said by the Crown to have been bleached whilst they were in the possession of the offender, such bleaching leading to the item becoming more fragile and decreasing its longevity. The Crown said items the subject of Counts 2, 4, 6, 12, and 13 had been bleached by the offender. The offender denied doing so but I am satisfied that that was a false denial.93 There are two main reasons for accepting the Crown case that it was the offender who bleached the relevant items. The first is the absence of any reason why anyone involved in scientific research would bleach the item. The evidence established that those who wished to study an exhibit for scientific purposes had no reason to bleach any bones and indeed there was a positive disincentive for so doing – that being that bleaching causes damage. On the other hand the offender didn’t want to study the items he stole, he simply wanted to have them, and in some cases display them. It might be thought that an item cleaned by bleaching would make a more attractive display than an unbleached item. So this is yet another case where the only person who has an incentive to do something which has damaged the items is the offender himself. 94 The second and more important reason why I conclude that the offender is the one who bleached the items which were bleached concerns the Salt Water Crocodile skull the subject of Count 12 on the indictment. When this item was in the Museum’s possession it was associated with the rest of the skeleton, but the offender only stole the skull. Upon recovery from the offender’s premises it is clear that the skull has been bleached because it is now a lighter colour than the rest of the skeleton which remained in the possession of the Australian Museum. The only explanation for this is that the skull has been bleached. This suggests that despite the offender’s denials of having ever bleached any item he stole from the Museum he has clearly done so. 95 Of course in making this assessment I have had to bear in mind, as with all other aspects where the Crown says the offence is aggravated, that the Crown bears the burden of proving the circumstance of aggravation beyond reasonable doubt. But I have also to bear in mind in my findings about the general credibility of the offender which is, I repeat, that I can place very little weight upon anything he said on oath to me where it is contradicted by other evidence. Teeth Missing96 Apart from the thylacine skull, a number of the items recovered from the offender were missing their teeth. The offender says that that was the condition they were in when they were stolen. The Crown says the teeth must have been removed, either deliberately or accidentally, while the items were in the offender’s possession. As far as the indictment is concerned the items the subject of Counts 2, 4, 6,7, and 8 did not have teeth with them when they were recovered by ICAC (although as I have already mentioned the teeth for the Thylacine the subject of Count 2 were found elsewhere in the offender’s premises after he pointed them out to ICAC officers).97 For reasons which appear above I am satisfied the offender is responsible for the removal of the teeth from the Thylacine skull, probably during the process of casting that skull. But I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he is responsible for the teeth being removed from other items. Clearly those studying the items would not remove the teeth or want them removed but equally those displaying the items, such as the offender, have no motive to remove the teeth either.98 Further there is no evidence that any of the items apart from Count 2 were cast while they were in the possession of the offender. There is thus no evidence that the teeth could have been accidentally removed during the process of casting. So in this case I am not prepared to find in the Crown’s favour that the offender was responsible for the removal of teeth from items apart from the Thylacine skull but nor am I prepared to find in the offender’s favour that he did not remove the teeth. It is a matter which is neutral.The Damage Caused by Pest Infestation99 As far as the items on the indictment are concerned there was only one specimen which was the subject of pest infestation. That was the Clouded Leopard the subject of Count 8. That infestation was treated and I gather that there was no damage to the item. 100 There was a dispute as to whether the infestation of that item and others the subjects of the various Forms 1 came about when the items were at the offender’s premises, or alternatively after they had been returned and placed in the Museum’s premises. 101 I do not find it necessary to resolve this issue. I am satisfied that it is not necessary to do so given the extent of the damage occasioned to the items in other ways. It would not make any difference to the result whether the offender was responsible for the pest infestation or whether the Museum was. I note in passing however the evidence suggesting that the offender was unlikely to have been responsible for the pest infestation because he was himself a pest controller was damaged somewhat by evidence from a witness, Victor Chiang, who was called by the offender himself, when he said that the offender was not a very good pest controller.The Offender’s Knowledge of the Scientific Value of the Items he Took102 It was a common theme in the offender’s evidence that although he now realises the scientific value of many of the items he stole, he did not realise this at the time. Again this is a matter which I reject, at least insofar as some of the items are concerned.103 Let us firstly consider the case of the Thylacine skull. A Thylacine is more commonly known as a Tasmanian Tiger. It is notorious, and I am satisfied that the offender well knew, that such animals are believed to be extinct but they remain of an enormous scientific, and indeed public, interest. 104 The offender must have known not only that Thylacine skulls were rare but also the obvious consequence of their extinction being that no new Thylacine skulls are likely to ever be obtained. Despite this knowledge the offender simply stole a Thylacine skull (Count 2 on the indictment) caring not that he was taking away for his own selfish purposes something of enormous scientific value. More General Damage105 As I noted earlier the Crown relied on the Museum’s loss caused by its reputation being harmed as one of the matters demonstrating the seriousness of the offences. Relevant to that issue is the evidence of Paul Clark. His evidence was put before me by way of tender of his statement. He was not required to attend for cross-examination and so in those circumstances I can accept the accuracy of what he says: 
     
      
      The Australian Museum’s reputation links directly to our branding. Good brand reputation is crucial to the success of the Australian Museum’s core functioning eg: 
       
       
        
         
         Attracting the general public 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         Attracting education/school groups 
         
         
         Securing corporate sponsorship for exhibitions and services 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         Securing exhibition contracts and partnership deals with international/national institutions 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         Attracting major gifts from donors 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         Attracting corporate philanthropy 
         
        
       
      
    106 Before commencing employment at the Museum, Mr Clark attended a national, bi-annual conference of marketing and development mangers from Australian cultural institutions. His statement noted: 
     
      
      At this meeting the enormous implications of the thefts were widely discussed. There was consensus that the damage caused to the brand of the Australian Museum and the loss of public trust in the institution pursuant to these thefts would cause great difficulty in eliciting corporate sponsorship and major donations. 
      
    107 He stated: 
     
      
      In a very competitive marketplace the theft of the Australian Museum’s specimens has damaged our brand value. The additional publicity surrounding this case will further limit our ability to generate future cash and asset revenues; as well as damaging audience numbers and income generation. It will take many years to rebuild a high level of trust and confidence in the Australian Museum. 
       
       
      The timing of this case impacts on our capital campaign for our revitalisation and master plan building program. The damage to our brand is immeasurable and the flow on effects will be felt for many years. 
       
      
    108 I accept this evidence, and will take it into account when assessing the harm caused by the offender’s crimes.Conclusion regarding Harm109 It will be obvious from what I have said so far that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the harm which has resulted from the offender’s many crimes is enormous. The harm can be categorised in various ways: He is responsible for damaging individual items; he is responsible for damage to the Museum’s reputation; he is responsible for the loss of scientific value of many items particularly through the disassociation of that item with its registered number; he is responsible for Museum staff having to spend a great deal of time attempting, not always successfully, to reassociate items with their numbers. 110 In many offences of stealing from an employer it is easy to quantify the damage because the loss is primarily monetary. But in this case monetary loss is but one aspect of the harm for which the offender is responsible. That is why I have had to take some time explaining my conclusions regarding the damage caused. 111 The harm caused by an offender is a matter clearly relevant to assessing the objective criminality of an offence. In this case, I repeat, the harm for which the offender is responsible is enormous such that, at least as far as some counts on the indictment are concerned, the objective criminality is either in, or in other cases close to, the worst category of offences of this type.The Failure to Return Some of the Offender’s Items112 Mr Steirn submitted during the course of the evidence that the Australian Museum staff were retaining material which they knew to be the offender’s in order to mitigate their loss. In other words the suggestion is that the Australian Museum realise the damage that the offender has caused and wish to make good some of that damage by retaining some of the offender’s own specimens. 113 There was not one single item of evidence to justify that quite extraordinary submission. The evidence was all one way – that is the decision not to return some items to the offender, apart from the gorilla which has been returned, was that of ICAC. The material is held at the Australian Museum, but is in the possession of and under the control of ICAC, no doubt for valid reasons connected with the prosecution of the offender.Subjective Circumstances114 The offender was born in the Netherlands in 1956 coming to Australia as a very young boy. He did some schooling in Australia but returned to Holland 6 years later. Whilst back in that country he developed an interest in collecting specimens of birds and other animals. He began to collect bird skulls which he cleaned, as well as road kill. 115 By the age of 14 or 15 he had developed an extensive collection which he brought with him when his family moved back to Australia. He was only in Australia briefly this time before going back to Holland where his interest in collecting specimens developed even further. 116 He obtained specimens through doing voluntary work with various organisations for which he was paid in dead animals which he would then clean. He also bought some items and continued to collect road kill. Whilst in Holland he learnt taxidermy being largely self-taught. He obtained his qualification as an electrician in Holland and commenced work with Rentokill. 117 He married in 1977 and had 2 children in Holland before once again moving to Australia in 1981. He brought with him his now very extensive collection. He was employed by Rentokill Australia but when he was not working he spent a great deal of time pursuing his interest.118 He was the manager of Rentokill in Wollongong and it was well known that he had a collection of specimens. From time to time he would be asked by charities to display those specimens. He did so on occasions. Material was tendered which showed the publicity that such displays had generated and it was clear that the charities had benefited from the offender’s endeavours.119 The offender suggested, and there was no evidence to the contrary, that with one exception he had never displayed any of the material he stole from the Australian Museum. The offender explained that the reason he only displayed his material was because the Australian Museum material wasn’t his to display. The obvious comment on that answer is that it is a shame the offender’s acknowledgment of the lack of his right to display the items didn’t also prevent him from stealing them in the first place. The one qualification to the offender’s unwillingness to display stolen items was that on one occasion he was photographed with a stuffed lion which he had stolen from the Museum. 120 By the time the offender had reached a stage where he was stealing items from his employer his collecting had become an obsession which he said took over his life. It almost led to the break up of his marriage when his wife got fed up with his obsession and went back to Holland until he persuaded her to come back.The Offender’s Circumstances Since Arrest121 The offender was dismissed from his position at the Australian Museum at the time his premises were raided by ICAC He has found it difficult to get work since then and now does deliveries for a local Chinese take-away restaurant on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. He also helps out a friend doing audio-video installations and pest control.Good Character122 The offender has no previous convictions and thus was a man of good character before he commenced his criminal activities by stealing the first of the items that he took from the Australian Museum. The Offender’s Motivation123 Clearly, what motivated the offender to steal 194 items from the museum over many years is important in assessing the appropriate sentence to impose on him.124 The offender is a compulsive collector of natural history specimens whether they be skulls, skeletons, skins or mounts. Over the years he had amassed a significant collection and was proud of it. But the primary purpose of his collection was not scientific study. The offender seemed to me to want to possess specimens simply for the sake of possessing them. 125 The offender claimed that he stole items from his employer to protect them but that is evidence which I just do not accept. I am satisfied that the offender stole these items simply because he wanted to have them. He enjoyed, indeed as I have said he was obsessed with the idea of, collecting specimens and accumulating specimens gave him great pleasure and satisfaction. When he was placed in a position where he could easily steal items to add to his collection he took advantage of his position – as I have said simply because he wanted to have the items which he stole.126 I reject the assertion repeatedly made, that the sole motivation of the offender was to look after the exhibits. That may (I emphasise may) explain some thefts but in at least a significant number of cases he took things simply because he wanted to have them. His attempts to pretend to me and to others including Dr Roberts (a psychiatrist called on behalf of the offender) that he was motivated solely by a desire to preserve specimens is, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, false. It represents an attempt by the offender to minimise his moral culpability, but falsely so. 127 The offender was cross-examined about why he taken the Marsupial Moles in particular. The offender stole a number of them (one is on the indictment and the others are on a Form1) and the Crown asked him why he stolen so many. The offender said he just took the drum in which the Marsupial Moles were contained because he wanted to take care of them. However it seems, apart from removing the tags, the offender did nothing to the Marsupial Moles. When he was asked by the Crown “but how are you looking after them any better than the Museum if you take them home and you don’t look at them, you don’t do anything with them”, the offender replied, “I can’t answer that, I honestly can’t”128 I reject completely any suggestion that the offender ever intended to return a single item that he stole. Not only is that suggestion contrary to his admissions of guilt but the very fact that he never returned any shows that he never intended to. The fact that the offender continued to steal from the Australian Museum over a lengthy period of time also suggests that the offender was intending to keep the items.129 In the offender’s favour, I am not satisfied that the offender committed these offences for commercial or financial gain. Were Any of the Items Abandoned?130 Part of the justification advanced by the offender for stealing many of the items was that he believed that they had been abandoned by the Australian Museum, or otherwise treated in such a way that the Museum did not deserve to have them. 131 On the final day of the hearing of this matter, after the evidence was closed, the Crown took me to various aspects of the evidence of Dr Boles, Dr Ingleby and Mr Sadlier. It is important to note that it was never put to any of those witnesses in cross-examination by Mr Steirn that any of the items stolen by his client had been abandoned by the Museum (that is, apart from a suggestion made to Dr Boles about some items being thrown out with the garbage – a proposition he denied). Thus at no stage were the witnesses given any opportunity to respond to the suggestion, later made by the offender, that the Museum was treating the items in such a way as to give the appearance that it did not want them. For that reason there is no categoric assertion by the witnesses to contradict the offender’s assertion. 132 Nevertheless the tables attached to the statements of the three collection managers from the Museum (on which they were not cross examined) establish that the items were not left at locations randomly distributed throughout the Museum but were in appropriate and known places, whether that be a place at the Australian Museum premises in College Street such as the main collection room or the Spirit House, or at the Marrickville off site storage unit. 133 To give a specific example, the Clouded Leopard the subject of Count 8 on the indictment was seen in the Museum by Museum staff only a week before it was stolen by the offender. It was clearly not abandoned by the museum as the offender suggested.134 The offender claimed that he took things so that he could look after them, but it is apparent from the state of the items when they were found by ICAC when they executed various search warrants that the offender was doing no such thing. Separating a skull from a skeleton as the offender did in both Count 7 and Count 12 is hardly looking after an item. 135 The offender must have also realised the importance the Museum placed on the Bulmer’s Fruit Bat the subject of Count 13 after notices were put up around the Museum seeking information as to its whereabouts. If he really did intend to look after items then his failure to return that item, perhaps surreptitiously, (even assuming in the offender’s favour that he stole it before the notices went up) demonstrates the offender’s attitude towards the items he stole. It was not so that he could look after them. It was so he could have them.136 Further, if they were abandoned, or treated by the Museum in the way the offender said they were, it is unlikely the their loss would have been noticed, but the evidence was that thefts were noticed in late 1997.Delay137 I accept that in this case there has been substantial delay not attributable, in at least a significant way, to the offender. The offender’s premises were searched on the 12th of March 2003 and within 2 months he had co-operated with the authorities fully by taking part in 2 electronically recorded interviews. He made substantial admissions during those interviews. True it is that he denied some matters, a position which was maintained in correspondence between his solicitors and the Crown, but I accept that the offender was always willing to plead guilty to those matters for which he is now to be sentenced. 138 The offender indicated that he would not be pleading guilty to some matters and, in a letter from his solicitor, explained why he had taken that position. Subsequently the Crown has decided not to proceed with those matters. I must assume that the offender is not guilty of those matters and so the consequence is that the offender is not to be held responsible for delay occasioned by his denial of matters of which he was not guilty. 139 This is a case where the Crown has taken a long time to marshal its case against the offender. That may well have been an inevitable consequence of the complexity of this matter but it has resulted in delay. The offender has had this matter hanging over his head for more than 4 years. The sentence I will impose upon him will be affected by the fact that there has been this lengthy delay. 140 The offender has also suffered a loss because of the delay, and the efforts made by his lawyers, justifiably as it turns out, to persuade the DPP not to proceed with certain matters. He has had of course to pay his lawyers for the work that they have done and I accept that he has extensive legal bills as a result of the need for his lawyers to correspond with the DPP, to appear in Court on many occasions when the matters were adjourned and to discuss the DPP’s responses with the offender himself. I will take into account when sentencing the offender that he has suffered a loss through having to pay expensive legal bills.Rehabilitation141 This case clearly has many unusual aspects to it. One of them concerns the fact the offender is highly unlikely to ever commit any offence in the future. Apart from his overwhelming desire to have for himself natural history specimens and him satisfying that desire by theft the offender has been for all of his life a man of otherwise good character.142 The chances that anyone in the future will let him near natural history specimens which are not his own is highly unlikely. The evidence was that one of the reasons the offender has not been able to obtain employment, apart from delivering Chinese take-away for a local restaurant, is because when he applies for a job his prospective employers use the internet and his criminal past is readily discovered. So I find in the offender’s favour that he has good prospects of rehabilitation, primarily because he will have little opportunity in the future to steal other items of natural history.Remorse143 Pleas of guilty are often said to be capable of being treated as evidence of remorse and contrition but that is not a universal rule. Where the case against an offender is strong and where despite a plea of guilty the offender refuses to admit the extent of his wrongdoing – both circumstances which are of application in the present case – the extent to which pleas of guilty may be treated as evidence of remorse and contrition is limited indeed.144 On the question of remorse - certainly he is sad because of the effect that his detection as a serious criminal, and the need that he be sentenced to imprisonment, will have upon his family. The offender is remorseful in that sense, but I am not satisfied that he is remorseful in the sense that he is sorry for having committed the crimes. Certainly he is sorry he was caught but that is not the same thing.145 There is no doubt that the offender is deeply sorry for the effect that his offences have had on his family, but I could see little if any acceptance by the offender that what he was doing was wrong. 146 It is noteworthy that on neither the Crown case nor the offender’s case did the offences stop because he had an attack of conscience. The Crown and the offender agree that the rate of offending merely slowed when he was unable to gain access to the parts of the Museum he had previously had access to in his job as a pest controller. The Assistance to the Authorities.147 The offender gave evidence for the Crown in a Local Court prosecution. Despite some prevarication on his part during the course of giving evidence it is to be noted that the accused in that hearing was convicted. The assistance, and the potential consequences for the offender, are to be rewarded by appropriate discount. However I will not quantify that discount separately from the discount for the plea of guilty. The plea of guilty148 The offender indicated early on his willingness to plead to a large number of offences. He refused to plead to some matters and a great part of the delay has involved some to-ing and fro-ing between the Crown and the offender’s lawyers as to the charges to which pleas of guilty would be entered. The parties even tendered correspondence between themselves as to the protracted negotiations which led to pleas of guilty being entered in this Court. It is apparent that the Crown has not proceeded with any of the matters which the offender denied during those negotiations. 149 In those circumstances I will take the pleas of guilty as having been entered at an early opportunity. That would usually result in the maximum discount being given to the offender for the utilitarian benefit of his pleas. But these sentencing proceedings were protracted, requiring the calling of evidence over a number of days and that evidence went almost exclusively to an issue which has been resolved in favour of the Crown, namely the extent of the damage caused by the offender’s misconduct. Although I accept that had the matter gone to trial it would have been a terribly complex and lengthy proceedings nevertheless the utilitarian discount I will allow for the plea of guilty is not at the high end of the range found in R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] 49 NSWLR 383.150 As I mentioned, the assistance to the authorities consists of the offender giving evidence for the Crown in a case which led to convictions before a magistrate. The offender’s evidence seems to have been fairly significant and the magistrate accepted him, with reservations, as a witness of truth. In those circumstances I will allow a reasonable discount for the assistance as well. Combining the discounts for assistance and pleading guilty I will impose a sentence which is 30% less than it would have been in the absence of those factors.Objective Criminality151 The extent of the offender’s wrongdoing can be seen in a number of ways: 
     
      
       
       The first concerns the number of items stolen. Adding together the counts on the indictment and those on the 5 Forms 1 reveals that the offender took a total of 194 items which did not belong to him.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       The second way of assessing the offender’s criminality is to consider the monetary value of the items he took, although it has to be remembered that the items were recovered. The value placed on the items by the Crown was $873,250 (although that appears to cover 199 items so it must include 5 items which are not the subject of any charge).  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       Then there is the length of time over which these offences occurred. It is common ground that the offender stole these things over a period of years.  
       
      
    152 These measures of the offender’s criminality are standard ways in which an offence of this type is assessed but this case is far from a standard case of theft from an employer because of the enormous damage which the offender has done despite the fact that the items were recovered.Breach of Trust153 The offender has pleaded guilty to 15 counts of stealing from his employer. A breach of trust is not a specific element of this offence although in the vast majority of such offences a breach of trust will necessarily be involved. I have to be careful therefore not to double count when I take into account that there was a breach of trust in the present case. 154 The breach of trust here was significant. The offender says that he stole most of the items with which I am concerned whilst he was employed as a pest controller at the museum. His job was therefore to protect the collection so that it would be available to scientists and others who wish to study items in it, and remain available for posterity. Instead of protecting the collection so that others could use it, the offender stole from it for selfish purposes so that others were denied access to the things he stole. Even when he was employed as a caster and moulder his employer trusted him to look after items in the collection but again the offender preferred his own selfish interests over the interests of others.Suspended Sentence Not Available155 Mr Steirn submitted that a full time custodial sentence was not required and that a suspended sentence would be an appropriate outcome in the circumstances. As I have decided to impose a period of imprisonment of more than 2 years I need say nothing more about the possibility of suspension.Special Circumstances156 This is the offender’s first time in custody which can be a special circumstance resulting in a shorter non-parole period than that which the statutory ratio would suggest. I will make a modest reduction in the non-parole period to reflect this circumstance. The reduction is modest, as I have said, because the effective non-parole period which I will shortly announce is, I consider, the least period which properly reflects the objective gravity of the offender’s most serious conduct.The Individual Counts On The Indictment157 Not all of the counts on the indictment are of equal seriousness. For example in some counts the items were returned undamaged and the specimen could be repatriated with its registered number. In other cases there was substantial damage, either physical such as the Thylacine skull the subject of Count 2 or due to the disassociation of the number, such as the Marsupial Mole the subject of Count 5. Some counts on the indictment have Form 1 matters attached to them but others don’t. Some items were very rare, such as the Bulmer’s Fruit Bat the subject of Count 13 and the Thylacine skull, but others were relatively common. Some items had historical significance such as the Ganges River Dolphin, the subject of Count 7 and the Adelie Penguin the subject of Count 9. 158 The High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 required that individual sentences be set for individual offences and so sentences for the offences on the indictment will not be identical to reflect the various circumstances to which I have made reference.159 I have divided the offences into 4 categories reflecting my assessment of the appropriate sentence for each offence. Sentences160 The sentences I impose are as follows, taking into account form 1 matters when appropriate.161 On Counts 3, 8,11,14 and 15, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years to commence today, 20th April 2007.162 On Counts 1, 4, 6,7,9,10,and 12, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years to commence 1 year from today, on the 20th of April 2008. Those sentences are fixed terms because of the sentences I will impose on the remaining counts.163 On Counts 5 and 13 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on the 20th of April 2009 with the balance of the term being one year.164 On Count 2, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on the 20th of April 2009 and a balance of term of 2 years.165 Thus the overall sentence is one of imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on the 19th of April 2012.

    JUDGMENTApplication to exclude out of court representations by Giac Nguyen.1 HIS HONOUR: In relation to the first application of the accused Cong Khanh Tran, that evidence of reported out of court representations made by Giac Nguyen sought to be relied upon by the Crown be excluded, I propose to grant that application and order that those purported representations be not admitted in any forthcoming trial in relation to Mr Tran. I will give my reasons now for coming to that conclusion. 2 Cong Khanh Tran was today arraigned on a charge alleging that he, on or about 25 November 2004 at Belmore in the state of New South Wales, supplied a prohibited drug namely heroin, being an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug. On arraignment the accused pleaded not guilty. Thereafter followed what could be called a voir dire examination to determine the admissibility of representations purportedly made by Giac Nguyen prior to the commencement of these proceedings in an Agreed Statement of Facts that were tendered at Mr Nguyen’s sentencing proceedings. The Agreed Statement of Facts constitutes Exhibit 1 in these proceedings, however it became apparent after a short period of time that the Crown did not intend to rely upon all of the contents of that Agreed Statement of Facts. I shall shortly refer to the material sought to be relied upon by the prosecution. I point out that the “Agreed Statement of Facts” is dated 25 September 2006. At the bottom of the fourth page are purportedly the signatures of Mr Nguyen, who I shall hereinafter refer to as the “Co-accused”, a solicitor by the name of Michael Croke, and a Detective Senior Constable of Police of the New South Wales Police Force, Detective Senior Constable Gary Lowe. The Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered by the prosecution in the prosecution of the co-accused and as I understand it, and it is not disputed, it was relied upon by the learned sentencing judge for the purposes of sentencing Mr Nguyen. I point out that it would appear on the Agreed Statement of Facts I have that the co-accused was facing an additional charge other than a charge related to the matter upon which Mr Tran has been arraigned in this court today. 3 The relevant charge concerning the co-accused to the current proceedings would appear to be that described as “Count 2” in the Agreed Statement of Facts. The Agreed Statement of Facts has a large number of what could be called “representations” in it, relating to Mr Tran, the applicant here. The particular representations relied upon however, within the document at page 3, are:  
     
      
      “On the evening of 25 August 2004, Police were monitoring a LD (listening device) at 4/84 Waverley Street, Belmore. At about 9pm a person by the name of Cong Khanh Tran (Tran) arrived at the unit. He was let in by the accused. He was seen to be carrying a plastic shopping bag. From the video installed in the flat he removed a large number of bundles of cash. The accused and Tran counted out eight separate bundles (representing $80,000) and a further bundle (representing $5,000). These nine bundles were placed into the plastic bag ... the $80,000 was payment for ten and a half ounces of heroin (294 grams). The extra $1,000 was a delivery payment for the suppliers delivering the heroin to Tran.” 
      
    4 The learned Prosecutor informs me by reference to that material that the representations as they arise from the that part of the Agreed Statement of Facts are firstly, that the accused Tran attended upon the relevant premises on the date and time alleged, secondly, that the accused Tran was carrying a shopping bag which contained the cash identified, thirdly, that the accused Tran discussed the contents of the bag with the co-accused, and that finally, the accused Tran received ten and a half ounces of heroin for the payment of the cash identified in the Agreed Statement of Facts. 5 The evidence in that form is objected to by the applicant represented by learned Senior Counsel, Mr Lakatos. The reason that the Crown seeks to rely upon the portion of the Agreed Statement of Facts to which I have referred is that the co-accused is an unavailable witness. I need not dilate upon that matter beyond observing that the co-accused was brought to Court today and made it clear that he did not wish to give evidence, he did not wish to take an oath and he did not wish to co-operate with the prosecution or the Court in any way. This was a fact, as I understand it, known to the prosecution before today and was known to the defence as well. The matter could have been forced by requiring the witness to take an oath and then take such action as was appropriate should he fail to do that or, if he took an oath, failed to answer proper questions asked of him by the learned prosecutor. I certainly do not infer any impropriety in any way, shape or form by the prosecutor calling him to court today, knowing that he would be uncooperative. Ultimately, for the purposes of resolving the issues litigated before this court, I am of the view that because of his non-cooperation and the fact, as I divine it, he would not cooperate in my view even if required to give an oath, even if subject to the threat of being held in contempt of court, Mr Nguyen is relevantly an “unavailable witness”. 6 The significance of this fact, as it ultimately emerged during the course of the day, is that the learned prosecutor as he outlined at the outset of the proceedings, asserts that the Agreed Statement of Facts, or that portion of it relied upon by the prosecution, is admissible to prove the truth of any representations therein contained, pursuant to Part 3.2 Evidence Act 1995 and particularly pursuant to s 65 of that Act. I need not go through the scheme of the Act in detail. It would be well-known to the parties and of course generally within the legal community, but primarily the situation is that evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation. There are exceptions, however, to that general rule. The relevant representation must be made by a person who had personal knowledge of the relevant asserted fact and there is a restriction on such representations to what is described as “first hand hearsay” in this Part of the Act. The relevant provision relied upon by the prosecution to admit the evidence of the agreed facts, is s 65 Evidence Act. S 65 provides, relevantly, that the section is concerned with the previous representation made by a person who is “not available to give evidence about an asserted fact”. As I said before, relevantly, for these proceedings, it is without dispute that the witness is unavailable. This section further provides at (2); 
     
      
      “The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person ... if the representation was either  
      
     
     
      
      c) Made in circumstances that make it highly probably that the representation is reliable or  
      
     
     
      
      d) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made.”  
      
    7 Ultimately as the matter has developed, it is quite clear that the Crown relies upon the latter of these alternatives set out in (s 65(2)(d)). The Crown asserts that the relevant portion of the Agreed Statement of Facts and particularly the representations which I have identified, is “against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made”. I have been referred, in terms of the interpretation of this provision in the context of the wider provisions of the Evidence Act to the decision of Regina v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509, to which I will refer shortly. Interestingly, a matter that I particularly raised with counsel as to the anomaly of the terms of s 65(3), (4), so far as the limitations upon sworn evidence by a person such as an accomplice or a co-accused, is discussed in Suteski. For the purposes of this judgment I acknowledge that those particular provisions have no relevance to the interpretation of s 65(2) or related provisions, however it must be fairly said it is a glaring anomaly in the scheme of the section. However, it does not in any way influence my decision and I need not dwell upon it any further. 8 In relation to s 65(2)(d), I note that the terms of s 65(7) insofar as it illuminates the term “against the interests of a person who made it”. In general theory one would have to clearly acknowledge that ordinarily an Agreed Statement of Facts in its terms would be “against the interests of the person who made it”, because it is upon those Agreed Statement of Facts that a person is to be sentenced and that was the case of Mr Nguyen’s situation. There are, however, in the contemplation of s 65(2) a number of matters that need to be particularly identified in order to determine the admissibility of the material relied upon by the Crown. 9 An important threshold matter is, of course, determining what relevantly is a “representation” for the purposes of the Section. In that regard the “Dictionary” definitions of the Act are most unhelpful. When one turns to the expression “representation” as such, the dictionary states “representation includes: 
     
      
      (a) an express or implied representation whether or in writing or 
      
     
     
      
      (b) a representation to be inferred from conduct or 
      
     
     
      
      (c) a representation not intended by its maker to be communicated to or seen by another person or 
      
     
     
      
      (d) a representation that for any reason is not communicated. 
      
    10 This might give us examples of representations. It does not necessarily provide a helpful guide as to what is in fact a “representation”, except by inference perhaps.11 Be that as it may, as I would understand the prosecution’s position in this matter, what is contained within the Agreed Statement of Facts is relevantly a “an express or implied representation...in writing”. In that regard I take into account Part 2 of the Dictionary. In relation to representations in documents, Paragraph 6 of Part 2 states “for the purposes of this Act a representation contained in a document is taken to have been made by a person if: 
     
      
      (a) the document was written, made or otherwise produced by the person, or 
      
     
     
      
      (and this is the most relevant part)  
      
     
     
      
      (b) the representation was recognised by the person as his or her representation by signing, initialling or otherwise marking the document” 
      
    12 It is at this point that I need to examine some of the evidence available to me and other matters that arise from the voir dire examination that I have taken into account in coming to the conclusion I have reached that s 65(2) has not been satisfied to permit the admission of the relevant portion of the Agreed Statement of Facts. 13 Firstly, I have available to me a pre sentence report that was tendered at the sentence proceedings of Mr Nguyen. I have seen Mr Nguyen in the flesh and I have had the benefit of evidence from his solicitor, Mr Croke, whose evidence I will deal with in greater detail shortly. I think it could be fairly concluded from the material available to me at this point of time that Mr Nguyen was a person born in Vietnam. The pre sentence report states, and I do not think it is disputed, that he was born on 25 October 1963. I appreciate of course that the pre-sentence report contains a great deal of hearsay information but it would seem that the basic facts are not in dispute in that he apparently left North Vietnam, or Vietnam as it was then known, around about 1987 after “defecting” or fleeing to Hong Kong. He spent three years apparently in a refugee camp and then went to New Zealand in 1990 and then came to Australia apparently in 1995. Even if those last particulars are not a hundred per cent accurate it is quite clear that Mr Nguyen is a man who had lived in Vietnam until his adulthood had commenced and that for him English was a second language. It would appear, if one was to include the time that he was in Hong Kong where English is a widely used second language, that he has lived in communities where English is widely used for approximately twenty years.14 Mr Croke gave evidence before me in relation to Mr Nguyen and his observations of Mr Nguyen that he spoke English quite poorly, that his comprehension of English was not good and that he suspected that he could not read English. I note in relation to his unchallenged evidence, although in fairness the Crown called him in chief and did not have the opportunity to cross-examine him, that Mr Nguyen when he conferred with Mr Croke, had a private interpreter present. If my note is correct apparently it was a young woman, her identity is unknown, and it would appear that Mr Croke was indicating that the primary communication he had with the co-accused was through this interpreter, although clearly there must have been some English exchange between he and Mr Nguyen to enable him to express the opinion that his English was poor. I note in relation to this aspect of the matter that Mr Croke, as I would understand it, does not speak Vietnamese. No-body has suggested that he did, nor has anyone suggested that he had the capacity to communicate with his client in that language.15 In relation to the agreed Statement of Facts, it should be firstly pointed out that the document is prepared in what could be called the “third person”. It is a document prepared for the purpose of presenting Agreed Statement of Facts for the sentencing of Mr Nguyen in relation to the charges to which he pleaded guilty. It is a document which in its terms is significant insofar as it outlines the basis upon which Mr Nguyen was implicated in the commission of the offence and not the current accused, because he was not a party to those proceedings.16 In considering this matter I note the evidence of Mr Croke that he expected that the document had been explained to the co-accused but he did not remember the circumstances in which it was explained. He described his normal practise would be to “explain the document” and he said particularly that he was satisfied that the document was, as I understood his word, “tenderable”, when he was asked a question “were you satisfied that he understood the contents of the document”. When that question was pressed he said, “I suppose he understood it, however I cannot remember if the document was read to him and interpreted to him”.17 The document itself was the product of some negotiations which had occurred between Mr Nguyen’s legal counsel and the Crown Prosecutor responsible for the prosecution of him. It would appear the co-accused had initially faced a more serious charge than at least the one with which this particular accused Mr Tran is concerned. 18 I have taken some little time to identify particular aspects of the evidence of Mr Croke in relation to this matter, admittedly in the absence of the benefit of any transcript. The reason I have done this is because it seems to me to take up an aspect of the submissions of Mr Lakatos SC, that, bearing in mind what the learned Crown has very properly drawn to my attention Part 2 of the Dictionary of the Act and particularly paragraph 6, there would need to be, at the very least one would have thought, reasonable evidence that the particular representations sought to be relied upon by the prosecution, were in fact recognised by the co-accused by his “signing, initialling or otherwise marking the document”. I note in relation to the document itself that there is nothing on it to signify that the documents in its terms had been interpreted or translated for Mr Nguyen. There is no signature of the purported interpreter. Merely, I would accept on the evidence of Mr Croke, the fact that in terms of the affixing of signatures, that Mr Croke was a witness to the signature of the co-accused. There is, if I may describe it very loosely, no jurat indicating in English or in Vietnamese that “I (the accused) have had this document interpreted for me and I agree that its contents are correct in every material particular” or words to that effect. Whilst I accept, as the Crown would urge me, that his signature upon the document is prima facie evidence of what is said to be a signing of the document such as to recognise the representations, of itself, in the circumstances that I have outlined, is not necessarily so in this matter. 19 There is a more subtle aspect to the matter, however that needs to be considered in the context of determining whether s 65(2)(d) is invoked. That is the question of whether the relevant representations that the Crown wishes to rely upon are sufficiently acknowledged by the co-accused. I have identified those particular representations. They are concerned with, in effect, the identification by the co-accused of this accused as being the person who did various things during the evening of 25 August 2004 that I have outlined. I have difficulty accepting that the signature per se is reasonably to be regarded in the circumstances as recognising that particular presentation. It may be a matter more relevant either to the reliability of the representation on one view of it, and that does not arise now in this matter given the basis of the Crown’s application to admit the evidence. Or it may be more relevant to the issue of the discretion to exclude the evidence pursuant to s 137 Evidence Act 1995. However the truth of the matter is that in making admissions against interests as may be, said to be the effect of an Agreed Statement of Facts, the role of others may not be necessarily as important a matter for consideration by an accused person (such as Mr Nguyen) than the admission of his own responsibility and his own acts in respect of the matters with which he was charged. 20 This is to be seen too in the context of the fact that the co-accused had not given an undertaking to assist the Crown at the time of the statement of the agreed facts. In fact, he has never given any undertaking in that regard, has never “out of court” expressed to the prosecution, or those that assist the prosecution, that the statement of facts is reliable in all respects or in relevant respects for the purposes of implicating the accused or any other person, or that he would at anytime be willing to give evidence against the accused in terms of the document. 21 I identify this matter because it seems, on analysis, to have a relationship to the issue, as it is expressed in s 65(2)(d), of whether the representations upon which the Crown rely that I have identified are relevantly representations that are “against the interests of (the co-accused)”. It seems to me on all the material that I could not necessarily conclude that that was so. The extent to which the agreed facts identify the conduct of third parties is, it would appear on all the material, not a vital or, ultimately, even a necessarily relevant factor so far as the description of the accused’s own guilt expressly stated or implicitly stated in the Agreed Statement of Facts.22 That that brings me back to the decision of Suteski, just for the moment, because I accept, as I must and I would have in any event, that Suteski is authority for the proposition that the out of court representations of a co-accused who is not available for cross-examination may be admitted into evidence as evidence of the facts contained within the representations. In other words they are admissible for hearsay purposes, even when firstly they directly implicate the accused for trial and where the co-accused is not available, for the giving of evidence, and cannot be cross-examined and tested as to the reliability, accuracy or truthfulness of the relevant representations.23 It should be pointed out in relation to the matter of Suteski however that in reality, in a range of ways, it is a very different situation than the current situation. As far as I am aware this is the first occasion, at least of which the parties are aware as well, where the out of court representations are contained within an Agreed Statement of Facts signed by a person for whom English is not a primary language and who ordinarily would require the services of an interpreter.24 In Suteski the relevant material that was admitted was material contained within an electronic interview conducted with Ms Suteski’s “co-accused”, a man by the name of Sakisi. Mr Sakisi’s account of events was that, so far as the matter of murder with which the appellant was charged, the appellant approached a mutual friend whose boyfriend, Ben Sakisi, expressed an interest in killing a person that the appellant wished killed for money. Mr Sakisi contacted a friend of his who, as I understand the summary of the Crown case at [11], struck the deceased with a hammer and stabbed him with a knife, thereby causing his death. At the time Mr Sakisi and that third person were drug dealers and users and it would appear that at the trial of Ms Suteski, Mr Sakisi for reasons I need not dwell upon, became unavailable. There was other evidence, of course, implicating the accused in that matter. Relevantly, Mr Sakisi gave an electronic interview to the police on 25 January 2000 and at between paragraph 64 and 74 are a number of extracts from that interview which were relied upon by the Crown to prove the fact of the matters asserted by Mr Sakisi in his interview. 25 As in this matter, the Crown relied upon the relevant representations as being “against the interests” of the man who made them, Mr Sakisi, and the learned trial judge held that they were against his interests and they were admissible pursuant to s 65(2)(d) and that the relevant representations were not to be excluded in exercise of the discretion pursuant to s 137. 26 Putting aside the issue of reliability, which does not arise now and was not relevant as the Court of Criminal Appeal held in Suteski because of the basis upon which the material was admitted, the out of court representations of Mr Sakisi came out of his own mouth. The representations were expressed, if one could use a very general description, in the first person. They were particular, as they went to the jury, and it could not be argued in any way, shape or form that they relevantly did not constitute reasonable evidence of “representations” made by a person out of court upon which the Crown could rely to prove particular facts. On analysis, that is far removed from this situation for the reasons I have outlined. No threshold questions of interpretation of the word “representation” arise on my analysis of the judgment to which I have been referred.27 I acknowledge that if I believe there was reasonable evidence of the making of a relevant representation then the only matter that I would be considering in this application is the question of the exercise of the discretion available under s 137 Evidence Act. I trust I have done justice in this ex tempore manner to the issues that, to my mind, arise out of the interesting application that proceeded before me today. I hope I have done justice to those matters that have been advanced on behalf of the learned Crown and the learned counsel for the accused. 28 Of course it must be said that they are not the only issues that I have had to consider in this matter. Some of the submissions made by learned senior counsel of the accused were accurately portrayed by learned senior counsel for the Crown as relating to a basis for admissibility that did not apply, that is s 65(2)(c). As I have earlier indicated, the Crown strongly relied upon the fact that it claimed that what was to be led from the agreed facts was against the interests of the person who made the relevant representations and that the information was relevantly a “representation” for the purposes of the Evidence Act. 29 However there arises from the submissions made by learned senior counsel for the accused, several matters that need to be commented upon because I do not wish to be regarded as having had what may be colloquially called “an each way bet”. There seems to me, even if I was in error in determining that s 65(2)(d) Evidence Act did not apply, a proper basis for excluding the relevant material in exercise of the discretion available under s 137. 30 It must be fairly said in the context of the discussion of this matter in Suteski itself, that is the discretion pursuant to s 137, that the evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution does not have great probative value as defined in the Evidence Act. It does not have great probative value because in its terms because, putting aside the fact that there may be other evidence that the prosecution may wish to lead such as the contents of a listening device tape that supports the representation, the statement of facts as I have earlier pointed out is prepared quite clearly for a limited purpose of establishing those facts upon which the co-accused must be sentenced. The preparation of such a document obviously has no implications directly for a co-accused such as Mr Tran as he is not a party to the proceedings. In such a situation involving an admission of guilt by the co-accused, the potential truthfulness of statements made about the involvement of others is ordinarily not so vital or not necessarily vital. 31 For good reason courts approach statements of facts implicating third parties, where they are not relied upon for the purposes of further evidence to be given by the person to assist the Crown, with some circumspection. I have often found myself in the situation of being given an Agreed Statement of Facts involving the role of the accused to be sentenced, implicating third, fourth and fifth parties, and discovered to my horror that after I have sentenced that particular accused, those third, fourth and fifth parties have come to this court to be sentenced on a different statement of facts in relation to the same charges. I have discovered that representations made in the first statement of facts about the role of the third, fourth and fifth parties are not either relied upon by the Crown or not established on other evidence in the sentencing of those other persons who come to court later to be sentenced. I am not necessarily saying that that ultimately would be the case here, had the circumstances been different and this accused had come to this court for sentence rather than for trial. But that practical illustration highlights the circumspection with which one must approach anything other than a direct admission against interest by an accused person when they either sign or acknowledge the accuracy of an Agreed Statement of Facts.32 In relation to the matter also I bear in mind of course other features touching upon the probative value, some of which I have already discussed in passing in a different context. First of all, the relevant part of the agreed Statement of Facts is in a third person narrative, albeit that with the assistance of the learned Crown I have been able to identify the relevant representations or claim to exist in the document. Secondly, as I have pointed out, the document is in English and the person who allegedly made the representations if they be representation, is a primarily Vietnamese speaker who, I am quite satisfied, would be relied upon an interpreter to properly understand anything written in English on a document on the basis of all the material available to me. I have no evidence available to me that the relevant portion of the Agreed Statement of Facts was read to the co-accused and expressly adopted by him as accurate. It may be of course that he understood the general implications of the statement of facts but in the context of seeking to rely upon this material as evidence of representations under the Evidence Act there would need to be, reasonable evidence of the fact that the co-accused had been alerted to the precise detail of the relevant matters sought to be adduced by the Crown implicating Mr Tran. 33 Of course there is that very issue discussed in Suteski particularly, it would seem, from [109] onwards, but more particularly at [116] to [118] and then again at [125] to [127]. Given the attitude of the co-accused, hence the Crown’s wish to rely upon the Agreed Statement of Facts, there would be no opportunity for the current accused to cross-examine the co-accused quite obviously as to the accuracy and reliability of Agreed Statement of Facts, and the circumstances of the signing of the Agreed Statement of Facts. There would be, on the basis of the evidence of Mr Croke, no means of independently verifying that the co-accused had an opportunity to be fully informed of the document, insofar as it implicates this accused as opposed to implicating himself. 34 I appreciate the complexity of the issue of “unfair prejudice” and I appreciate that the fact that a defendant cannot cross-examine a witness is not necessarily decisive of the issue which arises in relation to the provisions, to cite what has been said in Ordukaya v Hicks [2000] NSWCA 180 and expressly referred to in Suteski at [126]. However, in Suteski it was held by the Court in the judgment of the then learned Chief Judge at Common Law, that  
     
      
      “the decisions on this issue of unfair prejudice arising from an inability to cross-examine quite clearly depend upon their particular facts, that is, upon the character of the evidence involved and upon the nature or strength of the potential prejudice to the defendant. Each case, in my view, needs to be examined individually by reference to the well-understood balancing exercise”.  
      
    35 Of course in that context I obviously must acknowledge as a humble and mere District Court judge what is said by the learned Chief Judge at Common Law, as he then was, at [116] as to what the meaning “unfair prejudice” means or “unfairly prejudicial” and other cognate expressions mean is set out in the various authorities which have been identified in that particular judgment.36 Insofar as that issue was discussed in Suteski it must be fairly said that the circumstances of this matter are well removed from the situation in that decision, putting aside the fact or the possibility that there was other evidence which might support the reliability of Mr Sakisi’s version in the ERISP upon which he could not be cross-examined. In that matter the representations themselves were reliably proved by the very nature of the document that is the electronically recorded interview, which was to be used to produce the representations in court.37 As I say, if I am in error in my assessment of the evidence as it relates to establishing those matters that need to be established to invoke s 65(2)(d) I would have, in any event, exercised the discretion available pursuant to s 137 because when the balancing exercise is undertaken and the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the prejudicial effect or unfair prejudice of the evidence, the evidence must be excluded and this is such a case.38 I conclude by observing I am fully appreciative of the fact that these are very serious allegations and I am fully aware of the fact that the trade in heroin is something that of course the courts must be vigilant to ensure, by applying the law, is stamped out. The guilty must be brought to justice and the guilty must be severely punished. But the critical issue is whether the law permits a person to be found guilty or, to put it another way, allows evidence to be admitted. The appropriate approach to the matter is not to achieve some outcome that might satiate the community interest, but to do one’s best to apply the law as one understands it. Of course in this matter that requires a close consideration of the terms of the Evidence Act to ensure that only that evidence which the Act permits to be admitted is admitted to establish or to assist in establishing the guilt of a relevant accused.39 Thus, as I outlined at the outset, I would not admit the evidence of the out of court representations claimed to have been made by the co-accused in Exhibit 1 at the trial of Mr Tran.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  Madappa Kaliyanda, you have been found guilty by the jury of the murder of Asha Khanna. I am aware, of course, that you continue to dispute the finding of guilt and you maintain, as you said to police when interviewed in December 1999 that they had arrested the wrong person. At that time you were told that you would be charged with offences relating to the fraudulent accessing of Miss Khanna’s bank account. I shall later relate some chronology leading to your being charged with murder. 
     
      
    2 It is now my duty to make findings and impose sentences consistent with the verdict of the jury. 
     
      
    3 Asha Khanna was witnessed to leave her place of work at Liverpool Hospital at about 11.30 pm on 22 August 1997. Shortly after 4 am on 23 August two attempts were made at an ATM to access her bank account by use of a keycard or mastercard. It will suffice if I simply refer to a card. The attempts were unsuccessful. About half an hour later a withdrawal was made when the correct PIN was keyed in. I find that Asha Khanna died between 11.30 pm and 4 am just mentioned. She died as a result of asphyxiation, achieved either by her being smothered or strangled with a soft ligature. In harmony with the verdict, I find that you were her killer. 
     
      
    4 After the killing, Ms Khanna’s body was enclosed in its upper portions by a plastic bag which bore markings showing that it came from a Spotlight retail store. The body was then further enclosed in plastic garbage bags, one from the head pulled towards the lower body, the other from the feet towards the upper part. Thus fully enclosed, it was then tied by an encircling cord which had been taken from a dressing gown which was hanging in a rack in the deceased’s apartment.  
     
      
    5 The body, wrapped as I have described, was placed on a bed and covered with a doona or quilt. The door to the bedroom was closed and a towel laid against the gap of the door. These steps were obviously taken to delay the discovery of the body by inhibiting emanation of odours from its anticipated decay. 
     
      
    6 On 23 August, a telephone call was made to Liverpool Hospital falsely stating that Ms Khanna had travelled to India for family reasons.  
     
      
    7 The body was not discovered until 9 September. Police were unable to enter the apartment and the landlord’s agent discovered that his key would not release a deadlock on the front door. The lock was drilled out and Ms Khanna’s body was found as I have described. 
     
      
    8 Although other causes of death were canvassed at the hearing they were clearly rejected by the jury and, whilst it suffices in a sense for me to make the simple finding that Ms Khanna died as a result of your act of smothering or strangulation which unarguably would have been accompanied by an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm, I should make some reference to the evidence as a result of which you were identified as the killer. 
     
      
    9 Investigations showed that after her death Ms Khanna’s bank account had been emptied of funds to the extent of a little over $13,000 by a series of ATM transactions. The bank machinery recorded the times and other details and, at some machines, CCTV cameras photographed the person who was making the withdrawal. Significant among the transactions were those conducted at machines located in clubs namely Liverpool RSL Club (also known as the John Edmondson VC Memorial Club), Auburn RSL Club, Fairfield RSL Club and Mt Pritchard Community Club. These locations were significant because the Crown was able to demonstrate your presence on the bulk of these occasions at the particular club when withdrawals were made by cross referencing the various records including temporary membership or visitor’s books and signatures for jackpots or cancelled credits on poker machines which you had been playing. 
     
      
    10 You were a shift worker and ordinarily finished work after midnight and possibly even later after overtime. This explains your attendances at clubs during the early hours of the morning. 
     
      
    11 Following an observation of you by a police officer, you were under suspicion from very soon after the body of the deceased had been found. Surveillance photographs were taken and no doubt compared to the product of the CCTV cameras which were located near some of the ATMs. The evidence is imprecise but it can be deduced from questions put to you at formal police interview that there had been some publication of an identikit or like image about which there was discussion concerning its similarity to yourself. Pursuant to warrant, a listening device was placed in your home for about six weeks spanning November 1997. No incriminating conversation was recorded and it was acknowledged that (after translation from the language in which you were speaking) you and your wife had said words to the effect of wondering why you and she might be under suspicion because neither of you had ever been to the deceased’s flat. 
     
      
    12 Police interviewed your wife on 12 November 1997. She informed them that she was acquainted with the deceased to the extent that they attended on occasions at a prayer meeting which was held in a school. She knew of only one encounter between you and Asha Khanna which was at your home when you were introduced.  
     
      
    13 Police did not seek to interview you until 23 December 1999 after which you were charged with the fraud offences abovementioned. You were not charged with the murder until 2004. 
     
      
    14 On 27 November 1997 an anonymous letter was received by police purporting to detail events on 22 and 23 August and identifying the deceased’s former husband Chaman Lal Khanna as the killer and the author of a letter as being the person who extracted funds from her bank account. The author claimed to have fled to India by reason of his perceived similarity to a police sketch which had been shown on TV and fear of retribution for not reporting what he knew. The letter identified the deceased’s card and PIN being used to draw money at Liverpool RSL, Mt Pritchard Club, Fairfield RSL, Auburn RSL and local ATMs at Liverpool. It is true that the writing which makes the reference to Fairfield RSL is unclear but it was not suggested that I should not conclude accordingly and I do so. 
     
      
    15 I am satisfied that it was you who used the card at those locations.  
     
      
    16 I recognize that there are also details in the letter, prominent among them the very existence of Chaman Lal Khanna, of which the evidence does not disclose how you did or could have become aware. The evidence shows that the deceased was an almost obsessively private person who revealed little about herself to anyone and it is surprising that you could have some of the knowledge displayed in the content of the letter. The conclusions that could be drawn from the possession of specific knowledge on the one hand and the absence of likely knowledge on the other were debated at length before the jury. 
     
      
    17 Your authorship of the letter is not something of which it is necessary to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as an ingredient of or an essential element of proof of your commission of the crime of murder. I do not speculate upon the conclusion which the jury may have reached. I find it highly probable that you were the author of the letter which was designed to divert attention from yourself as a suspect.  
     
      
    18 Be that as it may, I am, however, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Chaman Lal Khanna had nothing whatever to do with the killing of his former wife. I am also so satisfied to the same effect concerning Richard Naidu whose suggested identification by a police officer I find was mistaken. 
     
      
    19 I accept that there was no evidence that you were sighted anywhere near the deceased’s flat at a time that could be relevant or at all; that there was no evidence of forced entry nor was there within the flat any forensic evidence such as fingerprints or deposited DNA which could be associated with you. The flat showed no signs of theft or ransacking although I shall refer in a moment to a matter concerning the deceased’s camera. 
     
      
    20 In a practical sense there was no issue at trial other than the identification of you as the killer. Setting aside the rejected hypotheses as to cause of death as I do, the proof that Ms Khanna had been murdered by someone was overwhelming.  
     
      
    21 In the absence of direct evidence, it was the Crown case that you, the person who stole her bank funds, were the killer. The strength of the Crown proof of identification was perceptible in a combination of matters. There is the visual correspondence between the CCTV photographs of the person accessing the deceased’s account by means of her card and surveillance photographs taken shortly after the finding of her body, your physical appearance depicted as well on a photograph taken when you were arrested for an offence of driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol and on the video tape of your interview with police. Second, there were the accumulating and unexplained coincidences of your presence at the very clubs at the very times that the account was accessed. Third, there was your possession of a camera identifiable as having been owned by the deceased, which you sold to the Cash Converters business. 
     
      
    22 Of course it is not individual factors but the conclusion of your identity as the perpetrator of the killing which required proof and, as I have said, I am so satisfied. It was of course necessary for the jury to find, if it was satisfied that you were the person who had taken the funds, that you were the killer. It was argued on your behalf that the facts and circumstances were equally consistent with your coming upon the body of the deceased already murdered and then making a decision to take her money. That hypothesis was obviously rejected by the jury and I also reject it. 
     
      
    23 I find subjective matters in your favour. You are a man of mature years, born in 1956, and have no prior convictions of any relevance. I discard completely the conviction for driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol as a matter of no weight detracting from your previous good character. I observe that you claimed to Mr Aitkin, the Probation and Parole officer that you were “set up” for that offence so that police could obtain your photograph and fingerprints. The police were in possession of photographs of you taken in 1997 in any event and, to the extent revealed in the trial evidence, there were no fingerprints found in the deceased’s flat in respect of which comparison was being sought. 
     
      
    24 It is clear that you have been a devoted and caring husband and father. I accept the attestations of your general good character, generosity and community spirit set out in the bundle of references which have been tendered. Although not expressly stated I infer that the authors of those documents are aware of your current circumstances and the reason for them.  
     
      
    25 There is undoubted validity in Mr Aitkin’s observation that it is difficult to reconcile your background of stable and strong family relationships and solid employment history with your involvement in the serious offence for which you stand convicted. 
     
      
    26 The Crown submits that this crime is either in the category of the worst case or on the borderline thereof. In short, the submission is founded upon a contention that by preying on a person who trusted you, you killed her to fulfil the desire to take her money. This desire was carried into effect by careful planning.  
     
      
    27 Your counsel submits that the indications relied upon by the Crown, principally the bagging of the body and sealing the room as well as the use of the card to access the funds, were as consistent with decisions made after the killings as motives for it.  
     
      
    28 There are many aspects of this case which it is impossible for me to know. I do not know how you came to be in the flat where I am satisfied the killing took place. I do not know how you ascertained the PIN in order to access the account. I do not know whether you brought the garbage bags with you or located them within the flat. I do not know, on the probability that you were the author of the anonymous letter above referred to, how you could have acquired an amount of the information set out therein. The evidence that Ms Khanna stated that she was desperate to have the next day off after receiving a telephone call at work on the evening of her death – which call cannot be associated with you – constitutes another matter which remains a mystery. 
     
      
    29 Nevertheless it was conceded that the particular submission left a vacuum, as it were, in which murder by smothering or strangulation by soft ligature took place. In terms of culpability the contrast is between killing for the purpose of obtaining money and killing for some unknown reason and then deciding to rob the deceased.  
     
      
    30 Whilst I consider that there is considerable persuasive evidence to establish the probability of the first alternative, I recognize the extensive gaps in the completeness in available knowledge and I therefore approach the question of sentence in accordance with the latter, that is to say, that for reasons unknown you killed Ms Khanna and then decided to disguise what you had done and avail yourself of the contents of her bank account. I do not find that your crime is in the worst category of murder thereby possibly attracting an indeterminate sentence. 
     
      
    31 In assessing sentence, I take into account and weigh in your favour two specific matters in addition to matters previously mentioned. 
     
      
    32 I accept the evidence of Dr Krishnan concerning your diabetes status and the diagnosis of depression advanced by Mr Diment. Your poor health will make the incidents of imprisonment more onerous than would be the case if you were in more robust condition. It is also relevant, particularly in terms of supervision and treatment, to consider this matter when setting a proportion between non parole period and total sentence. 
     
      
    33 The second matter is an appreciation of the effects of delay in your being brought to trial. Although, as I have said, you were a suspect within weeks of the killing in August 1997, the trial did not take place until 2007. No challenge was offered to the chronology advanced by your counsel nor the evidence of your wife that although she was interviewed in November 1997, you were not interviewed until December 1999. Of course, in the interim there was obviously a significant amount of painstaking detective work undertaken as revealed by the tracing of the use of the card on the ATMs, your presence when it was being used on occasions and the disposal by you of a camera which had been owned by the deceased. As I have mentioned, however, in December 1999 you were charged only with fraud offences.  
     
      
    34 From December 1999 to December 2003 you were required to attend court on between twenty and thirty occasions. The adjournments were sought by the prosecution and eventually the court (presumably the Local Court) was informed that no charge of murder would be preferred by the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, the fraud charges were not proceeded with pending the holding of an inquest into the death of Ms Khanna. This took place in December 2003 and subsequently in about August 2004 an ex officio indictment for murder was presented against you. 
     
      
    35 You were on bail until I committed you to custody on 5 March 2007 following the jury verdict. Nevertheless this long delay was not of your making and it is appropriate to take into account the situation of uncertain suspense in which you must have been for an uncommonly lengthy period.  
     
      
    36 Before imposing a term of sentence I should acknowledge and recognize the content of the victim impact statement presented by the deceased’s brother Vishba Srivastava.  
     
      
    37 As you are being sentenced almost ten years after the commission of your crime, you are entitled in law to be sentenced in accordance with any recognizable sentencing pattern which existed at the time of your offence. I should record that in this regard I have derived great assistance from the monograph on homicide sentences published by the Judicial Commission which for reference I indicate is Series 23 of January 2004. To enable you to understand what use I am making of published statistics I note that the median sentence for all murderers with no prior convictions in the survey period between 1994 and 2001 (214 convicts) was a head sentence of eighteen years with a non parole period of 13.25 years. The range of head sentences extended between ten years and life. Bare statistics do not of course indicate the likely huge differences in objective and subjective circumstances taken into account in individual sentences. There are published of course other figures relevant to persons with prior convictions and persons being dealt with for multiple offences. The median that I have mentioned reflects a person in your position, that is to say a person who has committed a single offence who has no prior convictions. 
     
      
    38 The figures are of course available only as a guide and it is necessary for me to make an assessment which I consider appropriate to the whole of the circumstances in this particular case. 
     
      
    39 As above intimated, I will adjust the proportion of non parole period to overall sentence to reflect a finding of special circumstances but I do not consider that this should result in a great reduction of non parole period in this particular case. 
     
      
    40 Irrespective of the exact circumstances in which you came to perpetrate this killing, your conduct manifested a callous indifference to what you did and to what you had done. Your continued protestations of innocence prevent you from seeking mitigation of sentence by reason of the demonstration of any remorse or contrition.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Allan Martin Simpson appears for sentence today after having been found guilty by a jury on one count of robbery in company. The crown case against him was not that he actually performed the robbery but that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise with those who did. The whole of the offender’s involvement was captured on a number of closed circuit television cameras which were installed at the 7-Eleven store where the robbery took place. The trial of the offender was unusual in the sense that there was no dispute as to the fact that a robbery took place while the accused was in the 7-Eleven store. What was in dispute was whether the offender agreed with those who performed the robbery that the offence would be carried out. 2 The footage from the closed circuit television camera was played in court and I have reviewed the footage in chambers for the purpose of preparing these remarks on sentence. That footage shows three men, one of whom is the offender, coming into the 7-Eleven store. The three men move about the store with one purchasing cigarettes by means of an EFTPOS facility. The offender is seen to surreptitiously enter a back room of the premises and to look around whilst there. It is clear he was searching for something to steal. He then returns to the public area of the store. Shortly thereafter, one of the three men, Mr Hampton, goes behind the counter where the victim of the robbery, Mr Zhang, was standing. He presents a knife to Mr Zhang and demands money. Mr Zhang hands over $1,500 to Mr Hampton, who then passes it to another of the three men, Mr Palmer. Eventually, the two of them leave the store. 3 The footage also reveals the offender leaving the store at about the same time that Mr Palmer commences to go behind the counter. It was the offender’s defence at trial that as soon as he realised what was going on, namely that Mr Hampton was robbing Mr Zhang, he left the store wanting no part of what occurred. His version of events as given to police in an electronically recorded interview, was that he had no knowledge that the robbery was going to be committed and as soon as he realised what was going on he left quickly. The jury clearly did not accept this as a reasonably possible version of events. By their verdict, they must have concluded that the accused entered into an agreement with Mr Hampton and Mr Palmer that a robbery would be committed. The crown case was that the offender’s part in the robbery was to assist by looking around to see if the robbery could take place, an activity summed up by the expression, “casing the joint”.4 The fact that the offender left the store immediately upon Mr Hampton commencing to rob Mr Zhang, raises the issue of the factual basis on which I am to sentence the offender. Why did he leave the store?5 I am satisfied that I should sentence the offender consistent with the jury’s verdict on the basis that whilst he agreed with Mr Palmer and Mr Hampton that a robbery would be committed, and whilst it was agreed that that robbery would be in company, and whilst he initially played his role as a person who was casing the joint, he changed his mind as soon as the actual robbery commenced. It may well be that what prompted the offender to change his mind was the presentation of a knife by Mr Hampton, or it may be that the offender simply thought better of it.6 Whatever the answer to that question, the fact of withdrawal is a very important aspect in assessing the appropriate sentence. It is also very important when comparing the sentence which was imposed by his Honour, then Acting Judge McGuire, on Mr Palmer. He received a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of three years with a balance of term of eighteen months.7 However, when comparing the sentence imposed on Mr Palmer to that which I will impose on upon the offender, it is important to bear in mind a number of factors, the most important of which is that Mr Palmer was sentenced on the basis that he knew that Mr Hampton was armed with a knife and that he knew that that knife was going to be used in the course of the robbery. Further, of course, Mr Palmer never changed his mind, unlike this offender. The offender is to be sentenced on the basis that he was not aware that a knife was to be used and that he withdrew from the enterprise as soon as the robbery itself commenced.8 Also in relation to Mr Palmer’s sentence, I have to bear in mind that he pleaded guilty and was on protection at the time he was sentenced. I have to ensure that as far as I can, the offender is not left with a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed upon him with a sentence imposed upon Mr Palmer. 9 The offender has a lengthy criminal history. Indeed, he was released from custody only a very short period of time before he committed this offence. I will not sentence him on the basis that he was on parole at the time of this offence, the crown being unable to demonstrate to me that that was the case. 10 The offender is now thirty-three years of age. He has four children but is separated from his de-facto partner who is the mother of his children. He had a troubled childhood and has had difficulties with drugs for a long period of time. The offender hopes to reform his relationship with the mother of his children upon his release from custody. It cannot be said that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, but he is frankly coming to the age where he might think better of spending large portions of the rest his life in custody. 11 To a psychologist he said that he was disappointed for becoming involved in the present matter. In view of the fact that he pleaded not guilty to the charge that requires some explanation. The offender did plead guilty to an alternative charge laid by the crown of being an accessory after the fact to the robbery. The evidence showed that after the robbery was complete, he met up with the others and assisted them in secreting the proceeds of the robbery. The offender admitted that he had been guilty of that offence but denied that he was guilty of the offence of robbery in company, although the jury did not agree. Nevertheless, that explained why it was that the offender admitted that he had been involved in wrongdoing and was disappointed with himself. 12 This is a case where the victim of the offence was vulnerable. I am not going to take into account as an aggravating circumstance that there was planning in this matter because it was, after all, a robbery in company matter and virtually all, if not all, robberies in company involve at least a limited degree of planning. But nor can I say that there was an absence of planning which amounts to a mitigating factor. The evidence is simply neutral as to whether there was planning or not.13 The offender also, I am satisfied, expressed his anger at the actions of his co-offenders when he was interviewed by police. I am satisfied that that expression of anger was genuine. That tends to demonstrate that whilst the offender was willing to involve himself in some criminal activity, he was certainly not intending to involve himself in the actual actions of the other two men. 14 Although the offender did not plead guilty to the offence for which he is now to be sentenced he did, as I have said, plead guilty to the alternative count which limited the issues which were before the jury at the trial.15 The R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 guideline is of some limited assistance, although the most important factor, to be borne in mind when looking at Henry, is that that was a guideline judgment for offences of armed robbery. This was an offence of robbery in company and although there was a weapon used, as I have said repeatedly, the offender had no part of that. He is to be sentenced on the basis that he was not aware that Mr Zhang would be robbed by an offender who was armed with a knife.16 In those circumstances I am satisfied that whilst a period of imprisonment is required, it does not need to be as long as that imposed upon Mr Palmer by Acting Judge McGuire. I am also satisfied that there are special circumstances in this case. They primarily relate to the need for the offender to be assisted in dealing with his problems with drugs, upon his release from custody.17 The order I make is this, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, it is agreed that that sentence should commence on 12 April 2006. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months which is to expire on 11 October 2007 and I set a head sentence of three years. The offender is therefore to be released from custody on 11 October 2007. It is a condition of his release to parole that he accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Sela Ratu Qoro appears for sentence today after having being found guilty by a jury of one of the most serious offences known to the criminal law. He was charged that whilst in the company of other male persons he had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting thereto, and deprived her of liberty for a period before that offence was committed. The maximum penalty for that offence is life imprisonment and it carries a standard non-parole period of fifteen years. That is a very good indication of the seriousness with which parliament and of course the community regards offences of the type I am about to describe. 2 I should mention at this stage of my remarks on sentence that there is currently in progress a trial of a person who the crown says was a co-offender with Mr Qoro. There should, of course, be nothing published concerning the present proceedings or these remarks on sentence which would prejudice the accused in that trial.3 The evidence at the trial involving Mr Qoro established that on 24 November 2005, the complainant was sexually assaulted by a very large number of men in a bedroom on the first floor of a terrace house in Eveleigh Street, Redfern. It was impossible, when listening to the complainant give her evidence, not to be struck by the callousness with which she was treated by the men who were assaulting her. She was treated as an object for their sexual gratification and nothing more. She was not treated as a human being. Those assaulting her cared nothing about the distress she was undergoing and the damage they were causing. 4 The complainant identified Charles Weatherall as being the ring leader. She was forced to perform oral sex on him and he incited others to sexually assault her, at one time urging them to, “be as rough as you like, she likes it”.5 The complainant was held prisoner while various men abused her. She was subjected to anal and vaginal sexual assaults, as well as being forced to perform oral sex on many men who at this stage remain unidentified. These matters all took place in the first floor bedroom and there is no evidence to establish that this offender was one of the men who assaulted the complainant at that stage.6 The evidence as to what the offender did to the complainant concerned what happened after she was moved to an adjacent room where there was a couch and a minimal furniture. She was thrown on to that couch and seated next to a young man who had been in the bedroom earlier. She described in evidence what happened. She referred to the offender as the “islander guy”, so in view of the jury’s verdict, when reading the complainant’s account of what happened to her at the hands of the offender, I will use the words “the offender” where the complainant has used the words “the islander guy”. This is what the complainant said, 
     
      
      “I got taken in there and got pushed down onto a sofa and the young guy had come and sit on the left-hand side of me and there was the offender. And I can’t remember who it was but someone had taken me in there and the offender came in and stood in front of me on the sofa and had pulled out his penis and grabbed the back of my hair and started making me give him oral sex. He was holding the back of my head and when the young guy came and sat on the left-hand side of me, he was trying to grab my head away from the offender and at first he was grabbing my hands, trying to make me rub his penis and then he was trying to pull my head away from the man standing in front of me to force it down on his penis.” 
      
    7 She described the offender this way, 
     
      
      “He had a really large stomach, he was fat and wearing beige shorts and a dark green t-shirt with a short sleeveless shirt over the top. And he had a white hat on backwards and you could see dreadlocks coming out of the side. I’d noticed while he was making me give him oral sex that he had three sort of black marks, sort of circles. They weren’t like the lump that Charles had, they were black and they were scattered on the top of his penis.” 
      
    8 The complainant gave evidence that the offender ejaculated during that particular act of oral sex. After the complainant had been subjected to this dreadful assault, a man identified as Shaun Weatherall rescued her. She was led to safety by him. He gave her a drink and the opportunity to dress herself and some money to get home. She went to the nearby home of a female acquaintance and made immediate complainant of having been raped. 9 The evidence against the offender was remarkably strong. His case was one of mistaken identity but there was significant evidence in the trial to prove that the offender was the man who had forced the complainant to have sexual intercourse without consent in the second room. That evidence concerned three lumps which the complainant observed on the islander guy’s penis which later turned out to match the three lumps that the offender has in his penis. Some of the strongest evidence to establish the accuracy of identification of the offender came, inadvertently no doubt, from the offender’s wife. The complainant described the penis of the man who was assaulting her as very small with three marks along the top. She said,  
     
      
      “On the top of his penis there were - I don’t know if they were black warts or whatever - but they were different sizes and they were on the top of his penis.” 
      
    10 The crown case established that the offender does have three lumps of different sizes on his penis. Mrs Qoro gave evidence that her husband had three lumps on his penis. This was consistent with what a police officer noted when he made an examination of the offender’s genitals. 11 In the trial there was some evidence called as to the practice of genital beading amongst some cultures. The offender gave evidence at trial that that was a practice that he had followed and that was how he got the lumps on his penis. As I told the jury, as a matter of logic, the more unusual the accused’s penis is, then the greater the support for the crown case that the complainant describes these unusual features.12 The crown case was that the complainant got right an impressive number of unusual details. Not only did she know about the lumps but on top of that she knew how many there were and that they weren’t all the same size. I reminded the jury also that although the complainant said that the lumps were on top of the offender’s penis, in fact they turned out to be in a different location. Nevertheless, as the jury verdict indicates, they were clearly satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was correctly identified as being the man who sexually assaulted the complainant in the second room.13 It is important to remember that the charge for which the offender is to be sentenced contains within it an element concerning the offender’s detention of the complainant, before he had sexual intercourse with her. The crown allegation, which the jury accepted, was that the offender was part of a group of men who kept the complainant where she was so they could have sexual intercourse with her without her consent. Each of the men who had sex with the complainant, including the offender, were, according to the crown, all part of a group of men who amongst other things kept the complainant a prisoner, that is they stopped her from leaving the house so they could all have their turn at assaulting her. Clearly the jury accepted that this offender was part of a joint criminal enterprise with others, who agreed that they would detain the complainant that evening.14 The evidence and the nature of the charge thus established that the offender is not to be sentenced as though he did not know about what had happened to the complainant before he sexually assaulted her. I will sentence the offender on the basis that when he forced the complainant to perform oral sex on him, he well knew that she had already been subjected to degrading and repeated forced sexual intercourse at the hands of a number of other men.15 The description of the offender’s conduct and the circumstances in which it occurred fully justified the attitude that parliament has shown to offences of this nature by providing a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of fifteen years. Of course, the standard non-parole period applies to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, and an assessment of the seriousness of the particular offence requires examination of the various aspects which go to make up the offence. The offender was in company with only one other man at the time he sexually assaulted the complainant, although there were a significant number of other men nearby. He was clearly involved in the joint criminal enterprise to deprive the complainant, that enterprise being an agreement between many others. 16 The form of sexual intercourse was oral intercourse. Some people might think this is a more serious form of intercourse than others whilst others might take a different view. In times past, it was sometimes said that there were gradations of forms of sexual intercourse. It may still be possible to say perhaps that digital vaginal penetration is a less serious form of sexual intercourse than others, but I do not believe that it is possible to say that forced oral sex is any worse or better than forced vaginal or forced anal sex, in particular in a case where, as here, the offender ejaculated.17 Further in assessing the objective gravity of the present offence, I note that the complainant was deprived of her liberty for a very lengthy period of time, although it cannot be said one way or the other whether the offender’s involvement in the deprivation of her liberty came about early on or perhaps only shortly before he sexually assaulted her. In such circumstances, it is not possible to say that this aspect of the offender’s misconduct is worse or better than it would be in a case in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.18 I also note that the circumstance of aggravation in the present case concerns the deprivation of the complainant’s liberty and that the offence in s 61J(a) also covers other circumstances of aggravation concerning the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm or threats to inflict actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon. There is nothing in those circumstances to automatically suggest that an offence involving the deprivation of a person’s liberty is automatically any more or less serious, objectively, than an offence where the other circumstances of aggravation are involved. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the offence is correctly described as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences under s 61J(a).19 The offender is forty-four years of age. Depending on which report I rely on he was born in either the Solomon Islands or Fiji. He appears to have been raised in Fiji with his parents separating when he was relatively young, having no contact with his father since then. He told a psychiatrist that when his mother remarried he experienced frequent violence from his stepfather.20 He came to Australia in the early 1980s as part of a boxing promotion, he being talented at that sport. He married in 1984 and he and his wife now have five children, their sixth child, Wesley, having died on 18 April 1983. The offender gave up boxing after marrying and since then he has had several unskilled casual positions for short periods, but has been largely unemployed since 1999. He is, or was, the primary caregiver to his children.21 The offender is a person who has a number of difficulties as far as his mental abilities are concerned. He is unable to read and write and has difficulties communicating. A psychologist’s report prepared in 1995 suggests that the offender functions in the moderate range of intellectual disability. On top of that, the offender has been hearing voices for some time and is now treated whilst in custody with antipsychotic medication. These two factors suggest that when assessing the appropriate sentence to impose on the offender less emphasis should be placed on general deterrence than would otherwise be the case. They also suggest that the offender’s time in custody will be harder than if he were psychiatrically well and did not have any intellectual disability. Further, the offender has previously been assaulted whilst in gaol.22 The fact that the offender’s time in custody will be harder than usual is a very important factor which suggests the imposition of a non-parole period less than the standard. There are, of course, other factors in this case suggesting the imposition of a non-parole period less than the standard. Those other reasons are to be found elsewhere in these remarks on sentence.23 Also relevant to the circumstance in which the offender will serve his sentence concerns the fact that he is currently on protection. Initially when the offender himself gave evidence, he described his condition as being that he was locked in his cell, as he said, “twenty-four seven”. However, it later appeared that he was let out of his cell to exercise in the yard attached to his pod and also, for two days a week, was allowed out of his cell in order to attend English classes. He would have had access to drug and alcohol counselling except that he applied for that too late.24 I do not wish to minimise the terrible circumstances in which prisoners serve their sentences in some gaols when I say that the evidence given by the offender does not suggest that he will serve his time in custody significantly harder than otherwise because of the fact that he is currently on protection. Even prisoners not on protection will spend a large proportion of each day locked in a small cell in some prisons.25 One of the issues raised during the hearing of the sentencing proceedings concern the relationship, if any, between the offender’s psychiatric condition and his offence. Nothing in the material presented to me suggested any connection at all. For example, there is no suggestion that the voices told him to abuse the complainant in the way he did, nor was there any evidence that because of his psychiatric condition he was less able to make appropriate decisions about his conduct that night. There seems to be no connection between the offender’s psychiatric illness and his moral culpability at all.26 One of the factors that has delayed the resolution of the present sentencing proceedings concerns an issue raised today when Mrs Qoro gave evidence. She gave evidence as to the effect of the offender’s incarceration upon their children, in particular her daughter who is twenty-two, her son Gregory who is seventeen and another son who is eight. I have to say that the evidence did not establish any exceptional hardship. The evidence in chief from Mrs Qoro was to the effect that Gregory had begun having problems with drugs, hanging around with the wrong people, and is significantly disadvantaged through not having his father’s influence around in order to control him. In evidence-in-chief, Mrs Qoro said that, “Gregory would listen to his father, but not listen to me”. However, in cross-examination a rather different picture appeared.27 It is the case that the offender has spent regular times in custody. Indeed he had only been out four and a half months before he was arrested on the present charges. During that time, when the offender was at liberty, Gregory was arrested by police, for robbing a taxi driver. That evidence seems to suggest that it cannot be made out that Gregory is significantly disadvantaged by his father’s incarceration.28 No doubt, however, the offender’s wife will find it much harder to deal with the raising of the children because of her husband’s incarceration. I will take that into account as part of the general mix of subjective factors. I will also take into account that the children will also suffer through their father’s incarceration, but that is a matter which is commonplace when parents are sent to gaol. Finally, in relation to this issue, I will take into account that the offender himself will do his time in custody harder knowing that because of his criminal activities he has left his wife alone to cope with the problems of raising their children.29 It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the sentence needs to reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. The standard non-parole period in a case where there was not a plea of guilty can only be departed from when a judge has given specific reasons for such a departure. As I said, I am satisfied that the offence is objectively in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, but I will not impose a non-parole period as long as the standard. Primarily that is because of the offender’s mental difficulties, but the other reasons I have mentioned also in my remarks on sentence.30 I will make a small adjustment to the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence to make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour. That small adjustment is related to the offender’s intellectual disability and problems with psychosis. But I have to recognise that I have already taken those factors into account in setting the non-parole period and the head sentence, and so to give significant weight in finding special circumstances would be to double count. I have also - and this is perhaps the most important constraint on the non-parole period - to recognise that the non-parole period itself has to reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct.31 The offender has been in custody since 4 January 2006, the date on which he was arrested for this matter. He is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a non-parole period of ten years. It is to date from 4 January 2006 and will expire on 3 January 2016, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of fourteen years.
